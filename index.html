When she and her mother move yet again, she tries to hide her TS. But it isn't long before the kids at her new school realize she's different. Only Calliope's neighbor, who is also the popular student body president, sees her as she truly is&#x2015;an interesting person and a good friend. But is he brave enough to take their friendship public? </p><p>As Calliope navigates school, she must also face her mother's new relationship and the fact that they might be moving&#x2015;again&#x2015;just as she starts to make friends and finally accept her differences. </p><p>Partially in verse and partially in prose with two intertwined points of view, Ellie Terry's affecting debut will speak to a wide audience about being true to oneself.</p><p><b>Praise for<i> Forget Me Not</i></b>:</p><p>&#x201c;Terry&#x2019;s debut novel thoughtfully traces the fragile emotions of two seventh graders: Calliope, a girl painfully self-conscious about having Tourette syndrome, and Jinsong, a popular boy she meets in her new town. T<b>erry, who has Tourette syndrome herself, offers enormous insight into an often-misunderstood condition</b>, writing in verse for Calliope&#x2019;s chapters and prose for Jinsong&#x2019;s.<b> Her poetic explorations of Calliope&#x2019;s anxiety and Jinsong&#x2019;s moral struggles are honest and moving</b>.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Terry, who herself lives with Tourette&#x2019;s syndrome, movingly draws from her own experience as she describes Callie&#x2019;s experiences and behaviors. The narrative alternates between Callie&#x2019;s and Jin&#x2019;s perspectives, with Callie&#x2019;s chapters in affecting, varied poems and Jin&#x2019;s in plain prose and e-mails. This heartfelt, multivoice story with a meaningful message about friendship and acceptance is <b>perfect for kids who appreciate realistic, character driven stories</b>, such as Rebecca Stead&#x2019;s <i>Goodbye Stranger</i> (2015).&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Written in a patchwork of prose poetry and free verse, Terry&#x2019;s narrative deftly represents the reality of TS in its fullness. It works to deconstruct common misconceptions, such as that those who have TS have a propensity to swear, and sheds light on the raw confusion and the frightening nature of a physical experience that is utterly unpredictable . . . This exploration of Calli&#x2019;s neurological disorder and her struggle to find her place <b>will stay in the hearts and minds of readers for a long time</b>....&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>School Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;<b>Terry&#x2019;s debut novel is a rare treat&#x2015;a beautiful story of middle grade friendship, crushes, accepting differences, and how to deal with the school bullies</b>. Terry&#x2019;s use of figurative language and symbolism is magical. It will offer lessons in tolerance, acceptance, and kindness toward those different than themselves.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>School Library Connection </i></p></p><p><b>Ellie Terry</b> is a poet, writer, and reader who is diagnosed with Tourette syndrome. She loves baking brownies and has a slight obsession with the moon. She lives in Utah with her husband and their three children.Gr 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;Terry's middle grade debut is about one girl's urgent search for true friendship and a sense of home. Constantly on the move after her father's death, Calliope June Snow (Calli) arrives in St. George, UT, with her lovelorn mother, a few suitcases, and an egg carton rock collection. Exhausted by her inability to fit in and tired of always being the new girl, Calli, who has Tourette syndrome (TS), seeks solace in a connection to her neighbor Jinsong, the student body president and an expert pitcher. The novel is a duet, with perspectives from both Calli and Jinsong. Written in a patchwork of prose poetry and free verse, Terry's narrative deftly represents the reality of TS in its fullness. It works to deconstruct common misconceptions, such as that those who have TS have a propensity to swear, and sheds light on the raw confusion and the frightening nature of a physical experience that is utterly unpredictable. However, Jinsong's efforts to defend and protect Calli feel somewhat truncated and predictable. Calli's final act of generosity toward Beatriz, one of her tormentors&#x2014;offering her the gift of forgiveness, symbolized by a laminated poppy flower&#x2014;appears both neat and unconvincing. Though the book has some flaws, the tale of a young woman with TS coming of age is an important literary perspective yet untold for a middle grade audience. VERDICT This exploration of Calli's neurological disorder and her struggle to find her place will stay in the hearts and minds of readers for a long time; a good addition for most collections.&#x2014;Alpha DeLap, St. Thomas School, Medina, WA</p><h2>The Big Picture Story Bible (Redesign)</h2><p><p><strong>The Bible is a big book about a big God who keeps a big promise!</strong></p><p>Everyone loves a good story&#x2015;especially children!

The biblical story is told well and in a way that will compel the attention of children. Parents, grandparents, and others will see this book as a friend as they teach their children the things of God.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>R. Albert Mohler Jr.,</strong> President, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;When serving as a pastor, I frequently purchased and gave this Bible to families with young children in hopes that the <em>parents</em> would read and absorb its message. Here&#x2019;s a Bible storybook that shows the biblical story from Creation to New Testament&#x2015;a book that anticipates Jesus in the Old Testament and makes his crucifixion and resurrection the proper climax of the New Testament. My wife and I love it. Our kids love it. I cannot recommend it highly enough.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Trevin Wax,</strong>&nbsp;Bible and Reference Publisher, B&amp;H Publishing Group; author, <em>This Is Our Time</em>; <em>Eschatological Discipleship</em>; and <em>Gospel-Centered Teaching</em></p><p>&#x201c;When my son was growing up we read lots of Bible storybooks. But somehow we missed the big story that all of the stories fit into. <em>The Big Picture Story Bible</em> provides a foundation for children (and their moms and dads) to grasp God&#x2019;s intention for his people to be in his place under his loving rule from the first page of the Bible to the last. What a treasure!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Nancy Guthrie,</strong> Bible teacher; author, <em>Even Better than Eden: Nine Ways the Bible&#x2019;s Story Changes Everything about Your Story</em></p><p>&#x201c;As someone who tries to establish a regular pattern of family worship at the dinner table, I am always on the lookout for good Bible story resources to use with children of all ages. <em>The Big Picture Story Bible</em> is written in a simple way with pictures that reinforce the meaning of the biblical text and often contain details that generate conversation and lead to a deeper understanding of the gospel. Even better, Helm&#x2019;s redemptive-historical orientation helps even the youngest Christians see the fundamental unity of the Bible and its single gospel message of salvation in Christ. As the title implies, it is an ideal book for helping little people get &#x2018;the big picture.&#x2019; I have given dozens of these away as gifts. Highly recommended.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Philip Graham Ryken,</strong> President, Wheaton College</p><p>&#x201c;This is an excellent book for both children and adults to read to gain the big story line of the entire Bible. The writing is excellent. The illustrations are excellent. The way the author summarizes the broad sweep of the Bible into 450 pages is also, excellent. If you&#x2019;re planning on getting married and making babies, plan on reading this book to your babies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Justin Buzzard,</strong>&nbsp;Lead Pastor, Garden City Church, Silicon Valley; author, <em>Date Your Wife</em> and <em>The Big Story</em></p><p>&#x201c;A powerfully done, relevant book for parents to teach their children about God. Buy this book and use it with your children.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Dennis Rainey,</strong>&nbsp;President and CEO, FamilyLife; Host, <em>FamilyLife Today</em>; author, <em>Stepping Up</em></p><p>&#x201c;This book is an outstanding resource for parents who delight in invading their children&#x2019;s lives with the gospel. Your children will learn and grow through the marvelous words and pictures, and your heart will be refreshed and comforted again and again with the greatest story of all.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Barbara Duguid,</strong> author, <em>Extravagant Grace</em></p><p>&#x201c;David Helm has a pastor&#x2019;s eye for the grand narrative of Scripture, combined with a father&#x2019;s understanding of how to communicate that big idea to little minds. Gail Schoonmaker&#x2019;s delightful pictures not only illustrate the text but also include additional details that invite parent and child to plunge deeper into the richness of the biblical account. Highly recommended!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Iain M. Duguid,</strong>&nbsp;Professor of Old Testament and Dean of Online Learning, Westminster Theological Seminary; author, <em>Song of Songs</em> (Reformed Expository Commentary)</p><p>&#x201c;This book is wonderfully illustrated and carefully written. The author labors for biblical precision, emphasizing a big God and the ugliness of sin. David Helm regularly asks questions in the course of the book, proving to be helpful fodder for discussion and interaction with your child. My kids are eager to bring the book to me to read and this gives me great joy as a parent. I am excited to heartily recommend <em>The Big Picture Story Bible</em>.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Erik Raymond,</strong> Senior Pastor,&nbsp;Redeemer Fellowship Church, Watertown,&nbsp;Massachusetts</p><p>&#x201c;I like how the book is illustrated and how all the stories fit together. We wore out our copy from reading it so much. It&#x2019;s great for children of all ages.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Alexis Raymond,</strong> age 10</p><p>&#x201c;I absolutely love <em>The Big Picture Story Bible</em>. It&#x2019;s full of rich theology for small people. David Helm makes it plain that the Bible is more than a collection of stories; it is God&#x2019;s story, into which we, his creatures, are called. It faithfully presents the richness and complexity of God&#x2019;s witness to us in Scripture, without distorted or misplaced emphasis. While there is no substitute for reading Scripture to and with our children, <em>The Big Picture Story Bible</em> is an outstanding introduction to the overarching biblical narrative.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Sarah Dahl,</strong> blogger, <em>Aslan&#x2019;s Library</em></p><p>&#x201c;<em>The Big Picture Story Bible</em> effectively achieves its aim to give children a majestic picture of God. The illustrations will stir children to ask questions about God&#x2019;s story. This is a worthwhile investment for your children. My family will be enjoying this book for years.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Joey Cochran,</strong> Pastor of Middle School Discipleship and Communication, Calvary Memorial Church, Oak Park, Illinois</p><p>&#x201c;The questions in <em>The Big Picture Story Bible</em> invite interaction with my children and help them anticipate what is coming next in the story. I enjoy reading this book with my children!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Kendall Cochran, </strong>mom of three</p><p>&#x201c;I like <em>The Big Picture Story Bible</em> very much. I like how it shows me that Jesus died on a cross and rose again on Easter!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Chloe Cochran, </strong>age 6</p><p>&#x201c;I like it! I like the pictures.

Photographs, graphics, illustrations, and big bold text all share space on two-page spreads that each have a distinct theme, such as how dinosaurs brought up their young, similarities in locomotion, or what scientists theorize about their brainpower. Though the subject of dinosaurs is a common one, this book emphasizes looking at dinosaurs in new ways, such as drawing parallels between adaptive characteristics of disparate species and discussing dispelled myths about prehistoric creatures. Exactly how and why theories about dinosaurs are created and how they change over time as new evidence surfaces is discussed in depth. Considering the breadth of scope, this appealing book can be appreciated by the dinosaur expert and novice alike.

(What Was?)</h2><p>Something wicked was brewing in the small town of Salem, Massachusetts in 1692. It started when two girls, Betty Parris and Abigail Williams, began having hysterical fits. Soon after, other local girls claimed they were being pricked with pins. With no scientific explanation available, the residents of Salem came to one conclusion: it was witchcraft! Over the next year and a half, nineteen people were convicted of witchcraft and hanged while more languished in prison as hysteria swept the colony. Author Joan Holub gives readers and inside look at this sinister chapter in history.</p><p>Joan Holub is the author of <i>What Was the First Thanksgiving?</i>, <i>What Was the Gold Rush?</i>, and other <i>Who Was...?</i> titles, including <i>Who Was Marco Polo?</i> and <i>Who Was Babe Ruth? </i>She lives in Raleigh, North Carolina.<p></p><p>What Were the Salem Witch Trials?</p><p>In the winter of 1692, trouble came to the village of Salem in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Witch trouble!</p><p>Suddenly, two girls got a strange illness. Their bodies twitched and shuddered. They spoke nonsense and seemed to be choking. They said they were being pinched and poked by something invisible. Soon more girls in Salem began acting strangely, too. If this was an illness, no one could find a cure.</p><p>Some villagers thought it might be the work of witches! Witches were serious stuff in the New England colonies. Scary stuff. Many people believed witches were real and that they wanted to hurt people. A hunt began in Salem to catch and punish the witches who were making the girls sick. But who were the witches? Could they be neighbors? Family members? Frightened villagers panicked. They pointed fingers at one another and cried, &#x201c;Witch!&#x201d;</p><p>Over the next ten months, about two hundred people in Salem Village and surrounding areas were accused of witchcraft. Most were women. A few were children. Almost all went to jail. There were trials. There were hangings. Innocent people were convicted of witchcraft and killed. It was horrible! For a while, it seemed there would be no end to this awful time. But eventually, the witch hunt did stop and so did the trials.</p><p>So, what was really going on in Salem in 1692?</p><p></p></p><h2>Kingdom Marriage: Connecting God&#39;s Purpose with Your Pleasure</h2><p>What happens when a kingdom man marries a kingdom woman? <i>Kingdom Marriage: Connecting God&#x2019;s Purpose with Your Pleasure</i> helps couples grow together as a kingdom couple to fulfill God&#x2019;s design and purpose for their marriage.

Across ten robust &#x201c;classes,&#x201d; Robinson explains whiskey history, how it defined the way whiskey is made in different countries and regions, the myriad styles, how aging and finishing works, and the basics of &#x201c;nosing&#x201d; and tasting whiskey. In chapters dedicated to American whiskey (including bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, and rye), American Craft whiskey, Scotch, Irish, Canadian, Japanese, and world whiskies, Robinson presents the best offerings from new and historic producers, how to choose among them, and how to build a collection of your own.

This thoroughly up-to-date and wide-ranging guide also offers helpful recommendations on how to lead your own tasting, a glossary of terms, food pairings, and tips on everything from glassware to whiskey festivals and how to read a label.</p><p>The intimidating task of writing a book on whiskey comes from the over forty books I have on the subject from whiskey writers I admire. Many of them are mentioned in these pages and are, for the most part, my peers. Along with the historic Alfred Barnard (whom everyone owes a debt to) and the late Michael Jackson, I slavishly followed their books, articles, blogs, and musings, seeking out more information, data and stories on the spirit that I love so well. To all of them, I owe an enormous debt of knowledge and wisdom and hope that I've kept their integrity.With all this talent and wondering what I had to offer on the subject, it was Dave Broom who unwittingly helped me focus. Encountering him soon after I started the project, I whispered sheepishly that I was writing a book on whiskey. Dave was excited and full of congratulations but his was the widest book in the library, and I admitted that I was indeed intimidated by his breadth and scope on the subject. "But Robin," he said "out of all of us, you may be the only one who's actually sold whiskey." That rang like a ship's bell in my head.I've been in the field, working with distributors, retailers, bartenders, and consumers. I pulled a roller bag down the streets of every city in the U.S. filled with sample bottles; loaded up my car and set up countless tables, stands, and kiosks in stores, bars, and event halls all over the country. I've poured thousands of samples and flown tens of thousands of miles. I've cajoled consumers, trained bartenders, motivated salespeople, and negotiated for an empty shelf slot with busy retailers. I've delivered cases and moved numbers. I was at Ground Zero of the whiskey explosion--and that is the story I can tell.This book was written by a long-time whiskey "fan boy" who became a whiskey insider.&nbsp; I was fortunate to make thousands of contacts in the industry over the last 11 years and from that made hundreds of new friends inside the industry.&nbsp; When the opportunity to write this book arrived, I was able to reach out to them and ask them to share their insights with me.&nbsp; I'm grateful they granted me that request.Not having written a book before, I was not paying attention to the amount I was writing to satisfy my publisher's word count.&nbsp; Subsequently, I over wrote it by many times ("Robin, you handed in 3 books").&nbsp; So the editing process was particularly brutal and illuminating.I'm aching already to write the next book.Robin Robinson is a renowned whiskey educator who created the popular <i>Whiskey Smackdown</i> series at the Astor Center in New York City.

Examining regimes and their rulers the world over and throughout history, from Roman Emperors to renaissance Popes, from Hannibal to Cesare di Borgia, Machievalli answers all these questions in a work of realpolitik that still has shrewd political lessons for modern times. <b>Tim Parks's acclaimed contemporary translation</b> renders Machiavelli's pointed original&nbsp; into language that feels as alarming and enlightening as when it was first written. His introduction discusses Machiavelli's life and reputation, and explores the historical background to the work.<br><br>For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,500&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>When Lorenzo de' Medici seized control of the Florentine Republic in 1512, he summarily fired the Secretary to the Second Chancery of the Signoria and set in motion a fundamental change in the way we think about politics. The person who held the aforementioned office with the tongue-twisting title was none other than Niccolï¿½ Machiavelli, who, suddenly finding himself out of a job after 14 years of patriotic service, followed the career trajectory of many modern politicians into punditry. Unable to become an on-air political analyst for a television network, he only wrote a book. But what a book <i>The Prince</i> is. Its essential contribution to modern political thought lies in Machiavelli's assertion of the then revolutionary idea that theological and moral imperatives have no place in the political arena. "It must be understood," Machiavelli avers, "that a prince ... cannot observe all of those virtues for which men are reputed good, because it is often necessary to act against mercy, against faith, against humanity, against frankness, against religion, in order to preserve the state." With just a little imagination, readers can discern parallels between a 16th-century principality and a 20th-century presidency. <i>--Tim Hogan</i>Here is the world's most famous master plan for seizing and holding power. Astonishing in its candor <i>The Prince</i> even today remains a disturbingly realistic and prophetic work on what it takes to be a prince . . . a king . . . a president. When, in 1512, Machiavelli was removed from his post in his beloved Florence, he resolved to set down a treatise on leadership that was practical, not idealistic. In <i>The Prince</i> he envisioned would be unencumbered by ordinary ethical and moral values; his prince would be man and beast, fox and lion. Today, this small sixteenth-century masterpiece has become essential reading for every student of government, and is the ultimate book on power politics.</p><h2>World of Eric Carle, Animal Babies 10-Button Sound Book - PI Kids (Play-A-Sound Books)</h2><p><p> Baby animals are cute, and they are even cuter when drawn by the amazing Eric Carle.

A fussy baby receives "ten little kisses on teeny tiny toes/nine laughing kisses on busy, wriggly feet/eight squishy kisses on chubby, yummy knees," and so on down to "one last kiss on your sleepy, dreamy head." Each member of the family takes a turn bestowing kisses on the child: mom, dad, grandma, big sister, and even the dog and cat. Katz uses bold colors and lines to accent the flat, yet expressive illustrations. Heavy use of pink, combined with an array of brightly colored patterns, adds to the tender, happy tone of the story. Collage pieces are seamlessly woven into the gouache and colored-pencil illustrations, and Katz throws in some surprising perspectives, such as the mother kissing the baby's toes shown from the infant's point of view. The final spread, which shows the whole family smiling down at the sleeping child in her crib, epitomizes the loving warmth of this pitch-perfect bedtime story. Though somewhat reminiscent of Molly Bang's Ten, Nine, Eight (Greenwillow, 1983), this delightful book has a charm all its own and will surely become a standard at baby and toddler storytimes.-Kathleen Kelly MacMillan, Carroll County Public Library, Eldersburg, MD</p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Gypsy Witchï¿½ Fortune Telling Cards</h2><p>Vintage deck of 52 cards with miniature cards in the upper left corners and descriptive pictures with meanings on the remaining portions of the cards.

The Afterlife Revolution triumphantly says that it can. After a near-death experience in 2004, Anne Strieber became an expert in afterlife studies and created an ingenious plan of contact which, to her husband Whitley's amazement, she proceeded to carry out, starting just an hour and a half after she died. As verified by famed afterlife researcher Dr. Gary Schwartz, who wrote the foreword, the Afterlife Revolution is among the most convincing stories of afterlife communication ever told, and is a ringing endorsement not only of the fact that we do not die, but also that the power of love can create an actual bridge between the physical and nonphysical worlds. The book points the way to a new relationship between the living and, as Anne puts it, &#x201c;what you call the dead.&#x201d; Anne tells of her experience on the other side, saying that &#x201c;we are light, alive,&#x201d; and that &#x201c;enlightenment is what comes when there is nothing left of us but love.&#x201d; Her descriptions of the afterlife are brilliantly articulate and nuanced, at once deeply familiar and uniquely her own. The Afterlife Revolution shows how to use basic tools such as what Anne describes as "objective love" combined with a simple but special form of meditation to build a relationship between physical and nonphysical worlds. It is intended to help us find that sweet point at which the souls of the living touch those of the dead. As Anne says, &#x201c;Mankind is divided, not so much between the sexes as between the living and what are called the dead. It isn&#x2019;t natural and it isn&#x2019;t necessary. We can become whole.&#x201d; The Afterlife Revolution is about the joy of doing just that, and the magnificent new human experience that will unfold as more and more of us learn to live in this way. &#x201c;It has been observed that belief in the afterlife is really a belief in the undying nature of love. In The Afterlife Revolution, Whitley Strieber gives form, story, and insight to that principle, mapping out in vivid, moving, and persuasive detail his continued communion with his beloved wife Anne. Our generation is passing through a renaissance of near and after-death literature. This memoir forms the gravitational center of that field.&#x201d; &#x2013;Mitch Horowitz, PEN Award-winning author of Occult America and One Simple Idea: How Positive Thinking Reshaped Modern Life</p><p></p><h2>Burning Ridge: A Timber Creek K-9 Mystery</h2><p><b>Featuring Mattie Cobb and her K-9 police dog partner Robo, <i>Burning Ridge</i> by critically acclaimed author Margaret Mizushima is just the treat for fans of Alex Kava.</b><br><br><i>On a rugged Colorado mountain ridge, Mattie Cobb and her police dog partner Robo make a grisly discovery&#x2015;and become the targets of a ruthless killer.</i><br><br>Colorado&#x2019;s Redstone Ridge is a place of extraordinary beauty, but this rugged mountain wilderness harbors a horrifying secret.

Through detailed explanation and over 40 case studies, you&#x2019;ll learn how to make money by wholesaling, buying, and/or rehabbing small apartment buildings - using none of your own cash or credit, and with no prior experience. You will discover the step-by-step approaches for finding deals, qualifying deals, finding buyers, finding investors and monetizing your small apartment deals; plus how to scale-up to larger apartments. This book contains the know-how and the motivation for you to jump to the fast lane and start doing small apartment deals now. Since 2002, when he bought his first small apartment nothing-down, Lance Edwards has done apartment deals ranging from 3 units to nearly 300 units. And since 2007, he&#x2019;s also been teaching others how to escape the rat race faster and play bigger - by starting with small apartments.</p><p>Lance Edwards is living proof of his mantra that you don&#39;t have to &#34;graduate&#34; from single family to multifamily - you can start with multifamily, just like he did. Lance purchased his first deal (a four-plex apartment) in March, 2003 - nothing down. Over the next 2 years, he went on to purchase 50 properties nothing down on a part-time basis, while working his full-time corporate job. In July, 2005, investing in apartments allowed Lance to retire from his 20-year corporate career to start a full-time real estate business that acquires and flips multifamily properties. In 2007, he added his training business to teach others how to create faster financial freedom by investing in apartments using none of their own money. Lance has students nationwide using his system to profit from flipping and buying apartments using none of their own cash. Lance has been speaking on how to raise private money and multifamily real estate investing to large and small groups since 2005. Even though Lance is based in Houston, he has spoken to real estate investment groups in all major cities in Texas, California, NC, Florida, and many other states. Lance engages the audience quickly and offers up more detailed information for free during his talks than most other fee paid speakers&#39; events. Lance also provides something that other gurus never do, Mindset Training. Anyone can speak about the skillset, but frankly, many students have a collection of dusty books, binders and tape packs sitting on the shelf with nothing but a receipt to show for it. Without the proper Mindset, unused skillset is a waste of time and money. This is why Lance&#39;s students who adopt his mindset training succeed with his skillset every time. Mindset training is included with every one of his classes and product offerings.</p><h2>Our Syria: Recipes from Home</h2><p><strong>Syria is where food, memory, and resilience collide: recreate the flavors of this beautiful country in <em>Our Syria</em>, for delicious meals anywhere in the world.</strong> <br><br>Syria has always been the meeting point for the most delicious flavors from East and West, where spices and sweetness collide.

Jim Harrison traces his upbringing in Michigan amid the austerities of the Depression and the Second World War, and the seemingly greater austerities of his starchy Swedish forebears. He chronicles his coming-of-age, from a boy drunk with books to a young man making his way among fellow writers he deeply admires &#x2014; including Peter Matthiessen, Robert Lowell, W.H. Auden, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, and Allen Ginsberg. Harrison discusses forthrightly the life-changing experience of becoming a father, and the minor cognitive dissonance that ensued when this boy from the "heartland" somehow ended up a highly paid Hollywood screenwriter. He gives free rein to his "seven obsessions" &#x2014; alcohol, food, stripping, hunting and fishing (and the dogs who have accompanied him in both), religion, the road, and our place in the natural world &#x2014; which he elucidates with earthy wisdom and an elegant sense of connectedness. <i>Off to the Side</i> is a work of great beauty and importance, a triumphant achievement that captures the writing life and brings all of us clues for living.</p><p>Rarely does one encounter a memoir so filled with the details of a life lived. Whether recalling bits of his past as a depressed child, manual laborer, Hollywood screenwriter, aspiring poet, novelist, or alcoholic husband, Jim Harrison pauses to analyze these moments--the cause and effect--and the choices that have made him who he is. Loosely divided into chapters, <i>Off to the Side</i> is somewhat rambling, and Harrison's opinions and conclusions occasionally remain obscure ("nearly everything you hear about Mexicans in the great north is utterly untrue")--but, to the benefit of readers, Harrison is never at a loss for ideas.<p> The solace Harrison finds in the natural world is most compelling, and it could be said he, too, shares Frost's "lover's quarrel with the world." After losing an eye at an early age and sinking into melancholy, Harrison's father advised that "curiosity will get you through hard times when nothing else will. Your curiosity had to be strong enough to lift you out of your self-sunken mudbath, the violent mixture of hormones, injuries, melancholy, and dreams of a future you not only couldn't touch but could scarcely see." These words were not lost on Harrison. With "no expertise outside of [his] own imagination" Harrison plays to his strengths in <i>Off to the Side</i> by setting down the events, experiences, thoughts, and feelings that have shaped his quite literate, truly American life. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p>"I'm not sure I'm particularly well equipped to tell the truth," writes Harrison. But with such a colorful life, there's not much need to tell lies. Bus boy, gardener, gourmand, novelist, screenwriter, drunkard-Harrison has done it all. Now add successful memoirist to that list. After a rugged outdoor childhood in Michigan, where an accident left him blind in one eye, Harrison moved to New York with vague ambitions to be a poet. Denise Levertov soon recognized his talent and launched Harrison on a literary career that eventually included teaching at SUNY Stony Brook, writing for GQ and Esquire, authoring several popular novels (The Road Home; Legends of the Fall) and writing Hollywood screenplays. Throughout, Harrison befriended an impressive gang of fellow free spirits: Jack Nicholson, Jimmy Buffett, Tom McGuane, among others. He swingingly recounts trout fishing with Richard Brautigan, bingeing with Orson Welles, arguing gay poetry with W.H. Auden and drinking with just about everybody. Alcoholism, Harrison writes, was his constant enemy, the writer's "black lung disease," as his friend McGuane once said. But he had other vices, too: strippers, cocaine, hunting, long walks in the woods by himself-all of which fed into Harrison's characteristic mix of freewheeling boho sensibilities and earthy western melancholy. A man as willing to shoot a grouse as trip on psychedelics-he claims to annually experience God-like visions and swears that he was once transformed into a wolf-Harrison is never less than intriguing. This fine memoir is a worthy capstone to a fascinating career.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Letters to Penthouse XXI: When Wild Meets Raunchy</h2><p>With more than one million copies in print, this series is a bestselling staple.</p><p></p><h2>Paul for Everyone: 2 Corinthians (The New Testament for Everyone)</h2><p><p>Making use of his scholar's understanding, yet writing in an approachable and anecdotal style, Tom Wright helps us to understand from the beginning of the second letter to the Corinthians that something unexplained yet terrible has happened.

The soldiers are Roman legionaries. And their quarry is a band of pirates who dared to kidnap Julius Caesar for ransom. Now, as Caesar exacts his revenge and builds a legend far from Rome, his friend Marcus Brutus is fighting battles of another sort, rising to power in the wake of the assassination of a dictator. Once Brutus and Caesar were as close as brothers, devoted to the same ideals and attracted to the same forbidden woman. Now they will be united again by a shock wave from the north, where a gladiator named Spartacus is building an army of seventy thousand slaves&#x2014;to fight a cataclysmic battle against Rome itself.</p><p>In a stunning depiction of one of the most intriguing periods in history, Conn Iggulden flawlessly recaptures the grand, heroic--and sometimes brutal--details of Julius Caesar&#39;s rise to power with storytelling genius. Now, in the second installment of this four-part cycle, the unbreakable Julius Caesar will be ransomed by pirates and left to seek vengeance on foreign soil. But his reunion with Marcus Brutus will be prove to be his true test as the two lifelong friends advance to fight for Rome in a bloody uprising led by Spartacus.

This is the subject of an engrossing new book, Professor Porsche's Wars.&#x2019; Stephen Bayley, Octane<br><br>&#x2018;Ludvigsen approaches the legend from a new and surprisingly rich angle &#x2014; the Professor&#x2019;s contributions to military ordnance, the design and production of which occupied him continuously throughout his long career. He produces a compelling tale of a prolifically talented engineer dedicated to innovation and perfection stubbornly battling against the often seemingly impossible constraints imposed upon him.&#x2019; The Automobile<br><br>&#x2018;Crammed with information, original photographs, illustrations and drawings, we reckon it's an essential addition to any military vehicle enthusiast's reference library.&#x2019; Classic Military Vehicle<br><br>Regarded as one of the great automotive engineers of the twentieth century, Ferdinand Porsche is well remembered today for his remarkable automotive designs including the Volkswagen Beetle and Auto Union Grand Prix cars. Yet there is another side to his extraordinary career, for he was an equally inventive designer of military vehicles and machinery. In this field too he excelled. Indeed the sheer versatility of his contribution is astonishing. Karl Ludvigsen&#x2019;s study is the definitive guide.<br><br>Karl Ludvigsen tells the complete story, detailing Porsche&#x2019;s relations with the Third Reich and the stream of advanced designs for which he was responsible. Among them were the Kï¿½belwagen, the Schwimmwagen, the Type 100 Leopard tank, the controversial Ferdinand tank destroyer and the colossal Type 205 &#x2018;Maus&#x2019; tank. He also describes Porsche&#x2019;s creative work on aero engines, tank engines and even his company&#x2019;s manufacture of the V-1 flying bomb, for which he designed a turbojet engine.</p><p>Karl Ludvigsen is a world-renowned and prize-winning historian and author with over fifty books to his credit. He has made in-depth studies of the cars and histories of Volkswagen, Corvette, Porsche and Mercedes-Benz as well as the careers of leading Grand Prix drivers and designers. A former vice-president of Ford of Europe, Ludvigsen has had a life-long interest in engineering and military history. Among his most notable publications are Porsche: Excellence Was Expected, Battle for the Beetle and Colin Chapman: Inside the Innovator."...hard to put down...The author has given us a eminently readable but learned treatise on a less known aspect of one of the greatest engineers of the twentieth century. The illustrations are well chosen and nicely reproduced, fitting the text and thus adding to the interest...with the added bonus of being written by Karl Ludvigsen it is a must have. Buy a copy and spend a day reading it, it is really hard to put down. Most enthusiastically recommended." (<i>The Bulletin of the Vintage Sports Car Club</i>)<br><br>...fascinating book on an unusually fascinating man, who's name is still a household word more than half a century after his death... This book doesn't shy away from what may best be considered the "dark side" of Porsche's life and times; the dealings with the Nazi's, and his relationship with Adolph Hitler, nor the use of slave labor in the factories manufacturing his products. In-fighting among the "personalities" who ran the various industries and manufacturing plants is well described, as is Porsche's less than cordial relationship with Hitler's Minister of Armaments and War Production; Albert Speer. Kudos to the author for a job well done on such a complex subject! (<i>Armor Modeling and Preservation Society</i>)<br><br>"If you believe that Karl Ludvigsen has already illuminated all aspects of the Porsche brand and person, now this book arrives that deals with the less-known military designs.<br>A comprehensive bibliography and index complete a work that is not just intended for those interested in automobiles." (<i>Austro Classic</i>)<br><br>"Readers will have come to expect lavishly produced and thoroughly researched books on Porsche from Karl Ludvigsen but this latest work from the Suffolk domiciled authority on all things Porsche takes the reader along a slightly different road in that it describes the talented engineer's work on military projects rather than motor cars. ... This is a book that is hard to put down, especially for anyone with an engineering bent. The author has given us an eminently readable but learned treatise on a less known aspect of the work of one of the greatest engineers of the twentieth century." (<i>VSCC Magazine</i>)<br><br>"I must say this book was not what I was expecting. It did not tell the story of the legendary sports car designer and manufacturer that we are all familiar with, but one of an innovative and forward thinking engineer, who was an active and influential part of the German 'War Machine' during both world wars. His design of the VW Beetle was not a surprise but his significant involvement in Aero engines, Marine engines, Tanks and even the V1 flying bomb certainly was. Ferdinand Porsche's relationship with Adolf Hitler, post war arrest and subsequent imprisonment as a suspected war criminal also came as a suprise...this book will appeal to not just those with an interest in engineering, but also those with an interest in the history of the first half of the 20th Century." (<i>Iceni Magazine</i>)<br><br>"We're all familiar with Ferdinand Porsche's automotive design work, but an oft-forgotten side of his career saw him designing many military vehicles. This book is a fascinating look at his work for the military, which spanned the first half of the twentieth century through both the First and Second World Wars. [It] chronicles Porsche's work for Adolf Hitler as one of his most trusted designers, where he was responsible for vehicles such as the Kubelwagen, the Schwimmwagen, and the Type 205 Maus tank. Porsche's work on aero and tank engines, and his involvement with the V-1 flying bomb, are also covered." (<i>GT Porsche</i>)<br><br>"A sobering account of a difficult time." (<i>Classic Cars</i>)<br><br>"Professor Porsche's Wars is illustrated with over 200 images and is an in-depth account of Porsche's little-known career as a military engineer during both World Wars. It features details of Porsche's relations with the armed forces of Austria-Hungary, and later Germany under both the Weimar regime and Adolf Hitler's Third Reich." (<i>Bury Mercury</i>)<br><br>"...crammed with information, original photographs, illustrations and drawings, we reckon it's an essential addition to any military vehicle enthusiast's reference library" (<i>Classic Military Vehicles</i>)<br><br>"...I am very glad indeed to at last have Karl Ludvigsen's take on Professor Porsche, both the engineer and the man. The research here is of the highest order, as is the avoidance of any sentiment or editorializing. Taken with his other books on related subjects, we Porsche enthusiasts have a fairly complete picture of what it meant to be Ferdinand Porsche. You won't have to be a dedicated war buff ( I certainly am not) to make reading this one entirely worthwhile."

What is non-linear time management?Non-linear time management is a commitment to action in the present moment. It's looking at a task and choosing NOW or &#x201c;not now.&#x201d; If it's not now, it's got to be NEVER, or placed in a time capsule that has a spot on the calendar and therefore out of the mind.The mind must remain clear and empty of all future considerations.In non-linear time management there is no line extending from my mind into the future. No tapeworm of unfinished business coming out of my body.Non-linear time management is best expressed by Elvis Presley when he sings, &#x201c;It's now or never, come hold me tight.&#x201d;The old-fashioned time management programs had a huge, burdensome focus on the future. The line of tasks stretched out forever into the future. It was fear-based and it was overwhelming to have so much of a future to carry around with you.It resulted in massive, pathological procrastination. Everything got put off in the name of perfectionism. Nothing was bold or reckless anymore. Therefore there wasn't much astonishing success happening for the world-weary practitioner.But when Chandler teaches people to go non-linear, a strange thing happens. New life and energy come in. When they open their emails they don't get to save them for later. They have to deal with them if they open them. Like little attackers in a computer game, there is no longer anywhere to hide. Life becomes a great game and everything is handled right now on the spot.All fear comes from picturing the future. Putting things off increases that fear. Soon we are nothing but heavy minds weighing down on weary brains. Too much future will do that.Only a warrior's approach will solve this. A warrior takes his sword to the future. A warrior also takes his sword to all circumstances that don't allow him to fully focus.Chandler is a coach by profession, and when he works with a client who is &#x201c;overwhelmed&#x201d; with too much to do and not enough time to do it he will often ask them to give him an example of one of the things they are burdened by every time they think about it. The client will give him an example and they will do that thing right now. The client is amazed. The only thing missing in this client's life was a bias for action.Most people think too much. Then they compound that problem by studying the feelings that come up for them as a result of that thinking.All this time that they spend thinking and feeling they could have been taking action. In a non-linear way. Linear time starts with your birth and ends (at the end of the line) with your death. Along that long linear line it's just one damn thing after another. Then the lights go out. What was the point?Non-linear time management stops all that weary nonsensical treading on the road to one's destiny.Rather than inching along horizontally you must simply rise up. Your life can now become vertical. Now you don't postpone challenges, you rise to them. You become a warrior. And it works.How, exactly, does it work? This book will show you exactly how it works.</p><p>Most people continuously struggle with their problems of procrastination and disastrous time management - especially in this age of instant global connection to everyone and everything. So writing a book about how I work with my clients on this issue of "time" was a challenge. I wanted it to be a book about non-linear time management, not the standard boring "tips" for managing linear time. So I called my book <i>Time Warrior</i>. <br> <br>The "violence" in the word "warrior" was intended. For although the work you do can be slow and easy, to master non-linear time you must pull out your sword ahead of time to carve out periods of space and silence. <br> <br>Your war is against interruption and distraction. <br> <br>Because if you can bring gentle sustained focus to a task, you'll never "fail."Steve Chandler has outdone himself.&nbsp;In&nbsp;his latest book,&nbsp; <i>Time Warrior</i>,&nbsp;he turns <br>the concept of time management on its head.&nbsp; He actually&nbsp;transcends the concept.&nbsp; <br>Chandler&nbsp;demonstrates that the very notion of time efficiency is outdated&nbsp;and unworkable.&nbsp; <br>For me this book&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;best of combinations: a stimulating ground breaker, an entirely fun&nbsp; <br>exploration and an energizing mind shift. <i>Time Warrior</i> is a gem - a book whose&nbsp;time has come. <br> <br>Jay Adams, Host -&nbsp;EMMY&nbsp;Award Winning&nbsp; <i>Breakthrough Medicine</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp; <i>Fight Zone TV</i> <br> <br> <br>If you want more time, make time for this book. No excuses. It contains <br>the secrets to productivity and will change your life. Now. <br> <br>Dr. Joe Vitale, author, <i>The Attractor Factor</i> <br> <br> <br>Think of all the things you'd like to do someday but&nbsp; <br>supposedly can't because there's not enough&nbsp;time. Now&nbsp; <br>imagine having your belief about 'time' being removed&nbsp; <br>from your&nbsp;mind with one&nbsp;slash of a samurai sword. That's what&nbsp; <br>Steve Chandler&nbsp;does for you in <i>Time Warrior</i>. He stuns&nbsp; <br>you with the REAL reason you're not getting things done, <br>then&nbsp;restarts you with the simplest, easiest and most profound <br>way to master your time without wasting a second <br>on managing it. <br> <br> Matt Furey, author, <i>The Unbeatable Man</i></p><h2>The Proper Study of Mankind: An Anthology of Essays</h2><p><p>Isaiah Berlin was one of the leading thinkers of our time and one of its finest writers. <i>The Proper Study of Mankind</i> brings together his most celebrated writing: here the reader will find Berlin's famous essay on Tolstoy, "The Hedgehog and the Fox"; his penetrating portraits of contemporaries from Pasternak and Akhmatova to Churchill and Roosevelt; his essays on liberty and his exposition of pluralism; his defense of philosophy and history against assimilation to scientific method; and his brilliant studies of such intellectual originals as Machiavelli, Vico, and Herder.</p></p><p>"Only barbarians are not curious about where they come from, how they came to be where they are, where they appear to be going, whether they wish to go there, and if so, why, and if not, why not." So wrote Isaiah Berlin in "The Pursuit of the Ideal," the semiautobiographical essay that commences <i>The Proper Study of Mankind</i>, the intellectual equivalent of a "greatest hits" collection. Born in Riga, Latvia, in 1909, Berlin left the Soviet Union for England 12 years later. After being educated at St. Paul's and Oxford, he would go on to become one of the 20th century's most vigorous--and eclectic--political philosophers until his death in 1997.<p> <i>The Proper Study of Mankind</i> shows the full range of Berlin's work and the breadth of his interests. In "The Originality of Machiavelli," after summing up what others have thought of the author of <i>The Prince</i>, Berlin launches into his own thoughtful analysis, concluding that Machiavelli's most significant contribution to philosophy was "his de facto recognition that ends equally ultimate, equally sacred, may contradict each other, that entire systems of value may come into collision without possibility of rational arbitration, and that this happens not merely in exceptional circumstances, as a result of abnormality or accident or error ... but ... as part of the normal human situation." This concept of pluralism is the undercurrent that flows through much of Berlin's writing on the history of ideas, whether he addresses opposition to the French Enlightenment or considers Tolstoy's theory of history. Other treats to be found in this collection include the autobiographical "Conversations with Akhmatova and Pasternak" and what might be considered "intellectual profiles" of Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. This book is highly recommended for any reader interested in modern philosophy; one can only hope that it will inspire some to delve into more of Berlin's work. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p><p><b>Isaiah Berlin</b> (1909-97) was born in Riga, Latvia, and immigrated to England in 1921.

Chiang Kai-shek, an autocratic, larger-than-life figure, dominates this story. A modernist as well as a neo-Confucianist, Chiang was a man of war who led the most ancient and populous country in the world through a quarter century of bloody revolutions, civil conflict, and wars of resistance against Japanese aggression.</p><p>In 1949, when he was defeated by Mao Zedong&#x2015;his archrival for leadership of China&#x2015;he fled to Taiwan, where he ruled for another twenty-five years. Playing a key role in the cold war with China, Chiang suppressed opposition with his &#x201c;white terror,&#x201d; controlled inflation and corruption, carried out land reform, and raised personal income, health, and educational levels on the island. Consciously or not, he set the stage for Taiwan&#x2019;s evolution of a Chinese model of democratic modernization.</p><p>Drawing heavily on Chinese sources including Chiang&#x2019;s diaries, <i>The Generalissimo</i> provides the most lively, sweeping, and objective biography yet of a man whose length of uninterrupted, active engagement at the highest levels in the march of history is excelled by few, if any, in modern history. Jay Taylor shows a man who was exceedingly ruthless and temperamental but who was also courageous and conscientious in matters of state. Revealing fascinating aspects of Chiang&#x2019;s life, Taylor provides penetrating insight into the dynamics of the past that lie behind the struggle for modernity of mainland China and its relationship with Taiwan.</p></p><p>Jay Taylor is a Research Associate at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University.&#x201c;The story of Chiang Kai-shek is so big, so interwoven with the story of modern China, and so complex, that it has defied a good biographical treatment. Now, Jay Taylor has provided us with a strong, vivid, and eminently readable biography of this major twentieth-century leader that captures his 'life and times' better than any previous work in English.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William C. Kirby</b><b>, </b><b><i>Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, Harvard University</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This splendid biography far surpasses previous scholarship on Chiang Kai-shek, providing new insights into the savage international and civil wars in China that raged for almost thirty years as well as Chiang's quarter century on Taiwan where he laid the predicate for democratic governance on the besieged island. <br>,&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Lampton, Hyman Professor and Director of China Studies, Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies</b><br><br>&#x201c;Following his masterful account <i>The Generalissimo's Son</i>, Taylor has fully tapped Chiang Kai-shek's personal diaries and a comprehensive range of sources to provide the most authoritative assessment of this towering figure in the Chinese revolution and global politics of the 20th century.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert Sutter, Visiting Professor of Asian Studies, School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University.</b><br><br>&#x201c;Chiang Kai-shek rivaled Mao as a dominant figure in the history of modern China. Taylor has taken a fresh look at his long, eventful life based on new sources, and suggests a controversial but persuasive new reading of Chiang's motives and actions. This vividly realized account will be the authoritative work for a long time to come.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Andrew J. Nathan, author of <i>China's Transition</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;American historians tend to portray Chiang Kai-Shek (1887&#x2013;1975) as an inept dictator who mismanaged China until Mao Zedong expelled him in 1945 and he finished his life ruling Taiwan under the protection of the U.S. military. But this...lucid biography by Taylor, a research associate at Harvard's Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, describes an impressive figure who left China a greater legacy than he has been given credit for...Taylor does not conceal Chiang's brutality and diplomatic failures, but he is an admirer who makes a good case that Chiang governed an almost ungovernable country with reasonable skill and understood his enemies better than American advisers did.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Jay Taylor's new biography, <i>The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for Modern China</i>, challenges the catechism on which generations of Americans have been weaned. Marshaling archival materials made newly available to researchers, including about four decades' worth of Chiang's daily diaries and documents from the Soviet era, it torpedoes many of that catechism's cherished tenets. This is an important, controversial book... Chiang emerges as a flesh-and-blood man rather than the buffoonish cardboard-cutout figure he has generally been portrayed as.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Laura Tyson Li</b><b>, </b><b><i>Washington Post Book World</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This enthralling book by Jay Taylor of Harvard University shows that [the] conventional views of both Chiang and the Chinese civil war are caricatures. It is the first biography to make full use of the Chiang family archive. This includes Chiang's own diary, in which he wrote at least a page of classical Chinese daily from 1918 to 1972. The picture that emerges is of a far more subtle and prescient thinker than the man America's General Joseph Stilwell used to refer to as "peanut," and Britain's chief of staff, Field-Marshal Lord Alanbrooke, dismissed in Cairo as "a cross between a pine marten and a ferret."&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>The Economist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Even in the rapidly widening field of modern Chinese history, it is unusual and gratifying to read a book that upsets not only the reader's previous views but even those of the author himself...Now a different Chiang stands before us. Drawing on new material, years of interviews with the dwindling number of those with first-hand memories of the Chiang family, and scrutiny of Chiang's voluminous diaries, Taylor reveals a much more interesting and despite his stiff exterior, frequently adaptable Chiang...The book is a huge advance on our knowledge of what happened in China from the early twentieth century to the present day, when an updated version of Chiang's Kuomintang is again in power in Taipei...There will be no oblivion [for Chiang].

Worse, he aggressively denies his affair, denouncing you as crazy to your face and to everyone you know, while he schemes to walk off with everything you have worked so hard for as he is reborn into a new life with a star-struck younger woman, as pretty as you once were, who will enjoy everything you have invested in &#x2013; your financial security, your home-life and even your children. Worse still, he is a notoriously hard-ball lawyer with every intention of crushing you in any way he can, of erasing you from his life, of reducing you to nothing, so that he can move on as if you never existed. Daniel T. Broderick III&#x2019;s relentless harassment of his discarded wife, Betty, made her increasingly crazy as he and his girlfriend &#x2013; then second wife &#x2013; Linda Kolkena Broderick piled on the pressure, until one day, on November 5, 1989, at her wits&#x2019; end and believing herself to be acting in self-defense, she confronted them in the early hours of the morning and in a panic shot them both dead. A multitude of onlookers has absolved Betty for what she did. Many even admire her, especially if they have suffered similar fates to hers. One juror at her trial openly questioned why she had taken so long to kill Dan under such extreme provocation. Now, twenty-five years into a thirty-two year to life prison sentence for her second-degree murder of Dan and Linda Broderick, Betty has reluctantly decided to give her personal account of what led up to that fatal and fateful day, when all three of their futures came violently and abruptly to an end.</p><p></p><h2>Identifying Ferns the Easy Way: A Pocket Guide to Common Ferns of the Northeast</h2><p><b><i>Identifying Ferns the Easy Way: A Pocket Guide to Common Ferns of the Northeast</i></b><br> **An easy-to-use guide for fern lovers. <b>**</b>Includes 28 common ferns. <br><b>**</b>Each fern is presented with "Tips for Identification" and "Interesting Facts." <br><b>**</b>Exquisitely drawn by Briony Morrow-Cribbs. <br><b>**</b>Terminology used in this book is user-friendly. <b>**</b>Presents a unique approach to illustrate how ferns are ...classified into major groups.</p><p>Since 1978, <b>Lynn Levine</b> has been an environmental educator, naturalist, and a consulting forester to private landowners.

She focuses on three ideas to describe her work: the concept of layered leadership, shared experiences in making meaning together, and the importance of rowing in the same direction as a school community.<br> Jennifer firmly believes that teachers know what they need when it comes to professional development, and she describes the layers of support that coaches can implement within a school, including in-class support, curriculum support and assessment, study group facilitation, and the cultivation of teacher leadership. She provides an explicit framework for implementing these layers of coaching and explains how administrators can use the literacy leader position to build and sustain change within their schools.<br> Literacy leaders and coaches can use this book as a road map for how to approach their work with purpose and intention. Online videos that accompany the book bring the text alive by showing readers what coaching looks and sounds like.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><p>Jennifer Allen is a literacy specialist in Waterville, Maine. She has worked in education for the last 25 years.&nbsp; Jennifer started as a classroom teacher in the primary grades and has been working in this position as a literacy/specialist coach for the last 16 years.</p><p>Jennifer received her undergraduate degree from the University of Vermont in 1991.&nbsp; Once she landed a job in the classroom she pursued a graduate degree at the University of Maine in the area of literacy which was completed in 1996.</p><p>In 2000 Jennifer left the classroom and started her journey as a literacy leader.&nbsp; Jennifer understands that coaches wear many hats and no one job description looks the same. Jen embraces a layered coaching framework in thinking about the various ways that coaches can support literacy and learning within a school.</p><p>Jennifer believes in teachers and believes that teachers know best what they need for support and professional development. &nbsp;She believes that literacy leadership should be responsive to the needs of a school community. She works to inspire and energize teachers while keeping students and their learning at the heart of her work. She believes in the importance of making meaning together and is always looking for opportunities to bring teachers and administrators together to the table for learning.</p><p>Designing Professional development that meets the needs of teachers is a passion. She works to create experiences that meet the needs of teachers whether they are voluntary or mandatory always working towards meaningful engagement and beyond compliance.&nbsp; The ultimate goal of professional development is to refine instructional practices that increase student achievement.</p><p>Jennifer&#x2019;s work reaches beyond the walls of classrooms. Using her layered coaching framework as her guide, she works with administrators to ensure that the coaching layers implemented within the schools are aligned to school and district initiatives. She believes that the role of the coach is one that can build capacity within the school and is an integral role in sustaining and maintain change initiatives.</p><p>Jennifer lives in Winthrop, Maine. When she is not working she can be found jogging, biking or hiking.&nbsp; She also loves to relax digging in the garden and cooking in the kitchen.</p>Jennifer Allen's second edition of Becoming a Literacy Leader (9781625310965, $33.33) covers the author's work as she moved to a new school and position as a literacy specialist, and examines what it means to assume such a role in supporting learning and change. While the first edition of this book detailed her work and move, this latest continues the process of evaluating her newfound role as a literacy guide, adding more information gleaned from the ten years since her first discussion and surveying the basics of how she applied her job to the school community. The result is more than just an update of events, but a re-assessment gained from further experiences in the blossoming school system and new position, and is a highly recommended reference for any teacher considering the role of a literacy leader.<br> Midwest Book Review, Bookwatch, November 2016<br> Education Shelf<br> &nbsp;<br><br>The second updated edition of Becoming a Literacy Leader: Supporting Learning and Change provides a revised new edition of her basic work, which detailed the author's move to a new school and job as a literacy specialist which required she put the most basic of teaching environments into place. This revision ten years later reflects new developments in the field of literacy teaching and new ideas she has designed as her profession evolved, and shares with other teachers the basics of both professional development and the process of building a student literacy framework. Chapters include discussion questions of literacy meetings, consider the key components of such processes as literacy intervention rooms, and assess progress and programs with a two-year track record and how data indicates the reading and writing development process. The result goes far beyond the first edition, making this a winner for aspiring literacy teachers who want field-tested assessments of what works and the challenges involved in shaping effective literacy programs.<br> Midwest Book Review<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Arts with the Brain in Mind</h2><p><p>How do the arts stack up as a major discipline? What is their effect on the brain, learning, and human development? How might schools best implement and assess an arts program? Eric Jensen answers these questions and more in this book.</p><p>To push for higher standards of learning, many policymakers are eliminating arts programs. To Jensen, that's a mistake.</p><p>This book presents the definitive case, based on what we know about the brain and learning, for making arts a core part of the basic curriculum and thoughtfully integrating them into every subject. Separate chapters address musical, visual, and kinesthetic arts in ways that reveal their influence on learning.</p><p>What are the effects of a fully implemented arts program? The evidence points to the following: </p>* Fewer dropouts<br><br>* Higher attendance<br><br>* Better team players <br><br>* An increased love of learning<br><br>* Greater student dignity<br><br>* Enhanced creativity<br><br>* A more prepared citizen for the workplace of tomorrow<br><br>* Greater cultural awareness as a bonus<br><p>To Jensen, it's not a matter of choosing, say, the musical arts over the kinesthetic. Rather, ask what kind of art makes sense for what purposes. How much time per day? At what ages? What kind of music? What kind of movement? Should the arts be required? How do we assess arts programs? In answering these real-world questions, Jensen provides dozens of practical, detailed suggestions for incorporating the arts into every classroom.</p></p><p></p><h2>Hosoi: My Life as a Skateboarder Junkie Inmate Pastor</h2><p><p>A mix of Tony Hawk and Brian Welch comes together in skateboarding legend Christian Hosoi, who reveals everything about his rise, fall, and redemption, in this amazing tell-all&#x2014;from being named the greatest skater of all time to bottoming out on drugs to finally finding redemption through God.</p><p>Fans of Slater Kelly&#x2019;s <em>Pipe Dreams </em>and Brian Welch&#x2019;s <em>Save Me From Myself</em>, and followers of Tony Alva, Jay Adams, and Steve Caballero, will be captivated by this extraordinary, star-studded story, a gripping read that ranges from the heart of the 1980s skateboarding scene to the inside of a prison, from Hollywood parties to intense prayer sessions.</p><p><em>Hosoi:</em> My Life as a Skateboarder Junkie Inmate Pastor takes readers to the heart of one little-known world after another&#x2014;and he portrays them in all their gore and glory for all the world to see.</p></p><p><p>Raised at the legendary Marina Del Rey Skatepark&#x2014;where his father was the manager and the Dogtown and Z-Boys crew were his mentors&#x2014;Christian Hosoi never questioned that he would become a full-time skateboarder. But no one could have predicted his meteoric rise to the apex of a burgeoning sport&#x2014;or the spectacular way he would crash and then create himself anew.</p><p>A professional skater by thirteen, known for his rock-star flair and dramatic aerials, Hosoi was at the top of the world before he was twenty, engaged in the rivalry that would shape years of skating: Christian Hosoi vs. Tony Hawk. At the height of his celebrity in the late 1980s and early '90s, Hosoi was the highest-paid skateboarder in the world and made the most of his celebrity status, counting Hollywood's elite as his friends. But the kid who first got stoned at age eight later found himself smoking meth full-time. And as Hawk walked away with every accolade, Hosoi went underground. </p><p>In January 2000, he was convicted for trafficking $65,000's worth of methamphetamine across state lines. In this gripping memoir, Hosoi recounts the crushing reality of his prison sentence and the day he made the phone call that would save him&#x2014;to his now-wife, Jennifer. She guided Hosoi toward Christianity, to the faith that sustained him in prison, welcoming him into a new life when he was released nearly five years later.</p><p>In the summer of 2009, Hosoi won the gold medal in the X Games Legends Competition. He won gold again in 2010. And now Hosoi's classic skateboard designs are flying off the shelves once again.</p><p>Packed with interviews from skateboarding stars past and present, <em>Hosoi</em> is not only a tell-all about fame, fortune, and failure&#x2014;it's also a strong testimony to the power of faith and the gift of change.</p><p>Christian Hosoi is widely recognized as one of the greatest skateboarders of all time. A professional by thirteen, he went on to become an industry icon. After serving time in prison for drug trafficking, he devoted his life to Christianity. Since then, he has risen to prominence in the skateboarding world once again and was the subject of a full-length documentary narrated by Dennis Hopper, <em>Rising Son</em>. Hosoi is an outreach pastor at the Sanctuary, "the raddest church" in Huntington Beach, and lives in Southern California with his wife, Jennifer, and four sons.</p><p>Chris Ahrens has worked as a full-time writer for nearly thirty years, with four popular books on surfing to his credit and bylines in publications that include the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, <em>The San Diego Union-Tribune</em>, <em>Outside</em>, <em>Family Circle</em>, <em>Skateboarder</em>, <em>Surfer</em>, <em>Surfing</em>, and <em>The Surfer's Journal</em>.

To her Microsoft-guru husband, she's a fearlessly opinionated partner; to fellow private-school mothers in Seattle, she's a disgrace; to design mavens, she's a revolutionary architect; and to 15-year-old Bee, she is her best friend and, simply, Mom.<br><br>Then Bernadette vanishes. It all began when Bee aced her report card and claimed her promised reward: a family trip to Antarctica. But Bernadette's intensifying allergy to Seattle--and people in general--has made her so agoraphobic that a virtual assistant in India now runs her most basic errands. A trip to the end of the earth is problematic.<br><br>To find her mother, Bee compiles email messages, official documents, and secret correspondence--creating a compulsively readable and surprisingly touching novel about misplaced genius and a mother and daughter's role in an absurd world.</p><p><strong>Maria Semple</strong>'s first novel, <em>This One is Mine</em>, was set in Los Angeles, where she also wrote for television shows including <i>Arrested Development</i>, <i>Mad About You</i>, and <i>Ellen</i>. She escaped from Los Angeles and lives with her family in Seattle, where her second novel takes place."This divinely funny, many-faceted novel...leaves convention behind. Instead, it plays to Ms. Semple's strengths as someone who can practice ventriloquism in many voices, skip over the mundane and utterly refute the notion that mixed-media fiction is bloggy, slack or lazy.... The tightly constructed WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE is written in many formats-e-mails, letters, F.B.I. documents, correspondence with a psychiatrist and even an emergency-room bill for a run-in between Bernadette and Audrey. Yet these pieces are strung together so wittily that Ms. Semple's storytelling is always front and center, in sharp focus. You could stop and pay attention to how apt each new format is, how rarely she repeats herself and how imaginatively she unveils every bit of information. But you would have to stop laughing first."&#x2015;<b><i>Janet Maslin, <i>The New York Times</i></i></b><br><br>You don't have to know Seattle to get Maria Semple's broadly satirical novel.... Underlying the nontraditional narrative are insights into the cost of thwarted creativity and the power of mother-daughter bonds, although a reader may be having too much fun to notice."&#x2015;<b><i><em>O, The Oprah Magazine</em></i></b><br><br>"Delightfully droll.... Semple...cuts a wry slice of a life-one that's populated by private school helicopter parents, obsessively eco-conscious neighbors, and green-juice swilling, TED-talking husbands-and one that's sharp enough to make us feel slightly relieved about not having to live anywhere quite so bucolic."&#x2015;<b><i>Megan O'Grady, <i>Vogue</i></i></b><br><br>"The characters in <i>Where'd You Go, Bernadette</i> may be in real emotional pain, but Semple has the wit and perspective and imagination to make their story hilarious. I tore through this book with heedless pleasure."<br>&#x2015;<b><i>Jonathan Franzen, author of <i>Freedom</i></i></b><br><br>"There's a lot to like in Semple's charming novel, including the vivacious humor and the lesson that when creative forces like Bernadette stop creating, they become 'a menace to society.' Even more appealing is the mutually adoring mother-daughter relationship at its warm heart."&#x2015;<b><i>Heller McAlpin, <i>NPR</i></i></b><br><br>"In her second novel...Semple pieces together a modern-day comic caper full of heart and ingenuity....a compelling composite of a woman's life-and the way she's viewed by the many people who share it. As expected from a writer who has written episodes of <i>Arrested Development</i>, the nuances of mundane interactions are brilliantly captured, and the overarching mystery deepens with each page, until the thoroughly satisfying dï¿½nouement."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Publisher's Weekly</em> (Starred Review)</i></b><br><br>"A comedic delight..."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Family Circle</em></i></b><br><br>"Agoraphobia and Antarctica are among the elements in Maria Semple's terrific novel."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Parade</em></i></b><br><br>"Semple's affecting characters, not-necessarily-nice humor and surprising plot twists make this novel an enchanting ride."&#x2015;<b><i>Carolyn Kellogg, <i>Los Angeles Times</i></i></b><br><br>"Warm, dark, sad, funny-and a little bit screwball....

Fort Worth, Texas, claims its own legend &#x2013; Hell&#x2019;s Half Acre &#x2013; a wild &#x2019;n woolly accumulation of bordellos, cribs, dance houses, saloons, and gambling parlors.<br><br> Tenderloin districts were a fact of life in every major town in the American West, but Hell&#x2019;s Half Acre &#x2013; its myth and its reality &#x2013; can be said to be a microcosm of them all. The most famous and infamous westerners visited the Acre: Timothy (&#x201c;Longhair Jim&#x201d;) Courtright, Luke Short, Bat Masterson, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Sam Bass, Mary Porter, Etta Place, along with Butch Cassidy and his Wild Bunch, and many more. For civic leaders and reformers, the Acre presented a dilemma &#x2013; the very establishments they sought to close down or regulate were major contributors to the local economy.<br><br> Controversial in its heyday and receiving new attention by such movies as <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, Hell&#x2019;s Half Acre remains the subject of debate among historians and researchers today. Richard Selcer successfully separates fact from fiction, myth from reality, in this vibrant study of the men and women of Cowtown&#x2019;s notorious Acre.</p><p>Richard F. Selcer, a Fort Worth native, is the author of seven books on Western and Civil War history. He teaches history at Cedar Valley College in Dallas, at Tarrant County Community College, and at the International Christian University in Vienna, Austria.The red-light district of Fort Worth, Texas began its colorful history with the cattle drives of the 1870s and lingered on through World War I. The "Acre," according to this entertaining account, supported a variety of vices, notably drinking, gambling, and prostitution. It also played host to the Wild Bunch, Sam Bass, and other colorful characters. This lively and readable work suffers from a repetitive text and some minor factual errors. For example, "Squirrel-tooth Alice," a well-known bawd, acquired her moniker on account of her pet, not her appearance. Due to a paucity of local sources, the author relies on "scholarly imagination" and accounts of other tenderloins. The bibliography includes many major secondary works, although Anne Butler's excellent Daughters of Joy, Sisters of Misery ( LJ 3/1/85) is unaccountably absent. Selcer's books would appeal to general and informed readers.<br><i>- Daniel Liestman, Seattle Pacific Univ.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Codes of Hammurabi and Moses with Copious Comments, Index, and Bible References</h2><p>The discovery of the Hammurabi Code is one of the greatest achievements of archaeology, and is of paramount interest, not only to the student of the Bible, but also to all those interested in ancient history.</p><p></p><h2>Fierce Medicine: Breakthrough Practices to Heal the Body and Ignite the Spirit</h2><p><p>In <em>Fierce Medicine</em>, Ana Forrest, charismatic teacher and founder of Forrest Yoga, combines physical practice, eastern wisdom, and profound Native American ceremony to help heal everything from addictive behaviors and eating disorders to chronic pain and injury.</p><p><em>Fierce Medicine</em> is also part memoir, detailing Ana Forrest's journey to move beyond her past as she helps others to do the same.

Not only is she perpetually cheerful, she also brightens the lives of everyone she meets.<br>How does Pollyanna manage to be so eternally optimistic? How does she spread her bright outlook among the sick, sad, and abrasive people of the town and transform the life of her lonely aunt? It's the "glad game," she says, describing the antidote to hardship and depressed spirits. But in a serious accident, the town almost loses its "Glad Girl," and everyone looks for a way to make this youngster happy again.<br>Translated into several languages since its original publication in 1913, <i>Pollyanna</i> has been made into a Broadway play, as well as a popular motion picture. One of the best-loved children's stories of all time, this classic&#x2014;along with its spirited heroine&#x2014;will inspire readers for years to come.</p><p></p></p><p>An abridged edition of the classic story by Eleanor H.

Dating from the Third Dynasty of Ur (circa 2100 BC), it is often regarded as the first great work of literature. The literary history of Gilgamesh begins with five Sumerian poems about 'Bilgamesh' (Sumerian for 'Gilgamesh'), king of Uruk. These independent stories were later used as source material for a combined epic. The story introduces Gilgamesh, king of Uruk. Gilgamesh, two-thirds god and one-third man, is oppressing his people, who cry out to the gods for help. For the young women of Uruk this oppression takes the form of a droit du seigneur &#x2014; or "lord's right" to sleep with brides on their wedding night. For the young men (the tablet is damaged at this point) it is conjectured that Gilgamesh exhausts them through games, tests of strength, or perhaps forced labour on building projects...</p><p>This edition provides a prose rendering of <i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i>, the cycle of poems preserved on clay tablets surviving from ancient Mesopotamia of the third mi llennium B.C. One of the best and most important pieces of epic poetry from human history, predating even Homer's Iliad by roughly 1,500 years, the Gilgamesh epic tells of the various adventures of that hero-king, including his quest for immortality, and an account of a great flood similar in many details to the Old Testament's story of Noah. The translator also provides an interesting and useful introduction explaining much about the historical context of the poem and the archeological discovery of th e tablets.<b>N. K.

Even Christians have a hard time stomaching such a thought, and many avoid reading those difficult Old Testament passages that make us squeamish. Instead, we quickly jump to the enemy-loving, forgiving Jesus of the New Testament. And yet, the question doesn't go away. Did God really command genocide? Is the command to "utterly destroy" morally unjustifiable? Is it literal? Are the issues more complex and nuanced than we realize?<br><br>In the tradition of his popular <i>Is God a Moral Monster?</i>, Paul Copan teams up with Matthew Flannagan to tackle some of the most confusing and uncomfortable passages of Scripture.

We need to wake up beyond our current belief systems, because the "controllers" of the New World Order are moving fast using the "Prophecies" to their advantage to implement their evil plan by 2020, when World War III will finally break loose.&nbsp;The author demonstrates that the hierarchy of power emanating from Rome and Jerusalem, with the Jesuits and the Zionist's united by a secret pact since the Second Vatican Council, are in cahoots working towards the creation of a world government. There is also China playing a new role in the NWO with the far reaching tentacles of Chinese Freemasonry manipulating economic Hit Men and disinformation artists, while Russia is building their Christian orthodox alliance to apparently oppose the Western antichrist.&nbsp;In this unprecedented scenario, we also have the involvement of the big media moguls like Ted Turner and Silvio Berlusconi and their role in manipulating perceptions.

This is an indispensable reference for anyone interested in spider diversity or identification. This updated edition provides more than 1,400 illustrations and keys to the genera in 71 spider families. Over 600 genera are included. Taxonomic changes since the publication of the 1st edition in 2005 are reflected in every chapter. The manual includes 76 chapters and a wealth of information including an introduction to spider morphology, natural history, collecting techniques and preservation methods; an overview of the current status and most recent developments in spider phylogeny and evolutionary history; a key to the families of spiders found in North America, north of Mexico; keys to the genera in each of these families; an etymological dictionary explaining the derivation of the names of spider genera and families; a well-illustrated glossary; a pronunciation guide to the names of common taxa; and a complete bibliography. This is the first completely revised version of the manual since its original publication in 2005. Note that this is not a photo-ID guide to spiders; it is intended to aid in accurate identification and to do this one must become familiar with some of the details of spider morphology/anatomy. To aid in this task, a guide to morphology used in classification is provided in the introduction.

His experiences gave him a passion to give the Bible to the common man, in the common language of English. Readers will share in Wycliffe&#39;s student days at Oxford University and see him work toward his goal of translating the Bible into English for all Englishmen to read.</p><p>ANDY THOMSON is the author of two children&#39;s books, Renegade in the Hills and Sheriff at Waterstop.Lynn Taccogna captures fourteenth-century English theologian John Wycliffe&#39;s youth at Oxford University. The Roman Catholic Church then owned one-third of the nation&#39;s wealth and was known more for its greed and pursuit of power than for God&#39;s message of salvation. The book focuses on Wycliffe&#39;s radical dream of an English-language Bible-to replace the Latin Vulgate version of the time. Taccogna&#39;s depiction of Wycliffe and his contemporaries&#39; spirited political and religious debates at the Kicking Pony Inn are delivered with authenticity.

Given the humble, economic conditions of the blacks in America, an inexpensive, yet highly nutritional diet was given to them by Elijah Muhammad. Before the health craze that has swept the country, Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam were head of the curve as far back as the early 30&#39;s. This is the second of two books written with this simple, yet revolutionary way of eating.</p><p>Elijah Muhammad was born on October 7, 1897 in Sandersville, Georgia. He met his teacher, Master Fard Muhammad in Detroit, Michigan after migrating there in the early 1930&#39;s. Upon the departure of his teacher, Elijah Muhammad became the Leader, Teacher and Guide of what went from The Lost-Found Nation of Islam in North America to what is known today as the Nation of Islam. Notable students of the Messenger were Malcolm X Little, later named Malik El Shabazz, Cassius Clay, also named Muhammad Ali, and Louis Wilcox, later named Louis Farrakhan.

Stuck in the land of status quo, we've forgotten how to think. And the very structures put in place to help businesses grow are now holding them back. It's time to Kill the Company. <br><br>What this book suggests is simple: to SIMPLIFY by getting rid of things first rather than continually building on what doesn&#x2019;t work; a form of spring cleaning for your organization. Innovation specialist Lisa Bodell urges companies to question assumptions and to challenge rules that have outlived their time. Killing these status quo attitudes makes space for change and more value-added work, like thinking. Bodell tells us that these changes need not be one-size-fits-all initiatives that are forced upon employees. Instead, we need to embrace smaller, positive behavioral changes that create ripple effects throughout the organization. Too many change initiatives simply add another layer of processes to the to-do lists of already overwhelmed and tired employees. Not this one. Innovation is supposed to make things better, not worse, easier, not more complicated. Kill the Company is your guide for simplifying and streamlining, then building and maintaining a place where everyone&#x2019;s innovative spirit and energy fuel the long-term goals of your organization. A company that empowers its people to think critically, question relentlessly, and act boldly, to move from Zombies, Inc. to Think, Inc., will own the future.</p><p><b>Lisa Bodell</b> believes in the power of simplification. She is the founder and CEO of futurethink, a company that uses simple techniques to help organizations embrace change and increase their capability for innovation. She brings her compelling message to over 100,000 people a year, showing them how to eliminate mundane and unnecessary tasks from their everyday routine so that they have more time for work that matters. Bodell has transformed teams within organizations like Google, Novartis, Accenture, and more. Drawing on her practical Midwestern upbringing and entrepreneurial background, she has used the power of simplification to launch three successful businesses, write two books (<i>Kill the Company</i> and <i>Why Simple Wins</i>), travel to over forty countries and forty-eight states, and sit on boards such as Novartis&#x2019; Diversity and Inclusion Board and the Global Advisory Council for the World Economic Forum.<br><br><b>Carlos Dominguez</b> is President and COO of the social marketing startup Sprinklr.<br></p><h2>Teaching Children&#39;s Literature: It&#39;s Critical!</h2><p><p>Inviting multiple ways of critically engaging with literature, this text offers a fresh perspective on how to integrate children&#x2019;s literature into and across the curriculum in effective, purposeful ways.

Yet as they dine, the expectation of their marital duties become overwhelming. Unbeknownst to them both, the decisions they make this night will resonate throughout their lives. With exquisite prose, Ian McEwan creates in <i>On Chesil Beach</i> a story of lives transformed by a gesture not made or a word not spoken.</p><p>Such is Ian McEwan's genius that, despite rambling nature walks and the naming of birds, his subject matter remains hermetically sealed in the hearts of two people.<p> It is 1962 when Edward and Florence, 23 and 22 respectively, marry and repair to a hotel on the Dorset coast for their honeymoon. They are both virgins, both apprehensive about what's next and in Florence's case, utterly and blindly terrified and repelled by the little she knows. Through a tense dinner in their room, because Florence has decided that the weather is not fine enough to dine on the terrace, they are attended by two local boys acting as waiters. The cameo appearances of the boys and Edward and Florence's parents and siblings serve only to underline the emotional isolation of the two principals. Florence says of herself: "...she lacked some simple mental trick that everyone else had, a mechanism so ordinary that no one ever mentioned it, an immediate sensual connection to people and events, and to her own needs and desires...."</p><p> They are on the cusp of a rather ordinary marital undertaking in differing states of readiness, willingness and ardor. McEwan says: "Where he merely suffered conventional first-night nerves, she experienced a visceral dread, a helpless disgust as palpable as seasickness." Edward, having denied himself even the release of self-pleasuring for a week, in order to be tip-top for Florence, is mentally pawing the ground. His sensitivity keeps him from being obvious, but he is getting anxious. Florence, on the other hand, knows that she is not capable of the kind of arousal that will make any of this easy. She has held Edward off for a year, and now the reckoning is upon her.</p><p> McEwan is the master of the defining moment, that place and time when, once it has taken place, nothing will ever be the same after it. It does not go well and Florence flees the room. "As she understood it, there were no words to name what had happened, there existed no shared language in which two sane adults could describe such events to each other." Edward eventually follows her and they have a poignant and painful conversation where accusations are made, ugly things are said and roads are taken from which, in the case of these two, the way back cannot be found. Late in Edward's life he realizes: "Love and patience--if only he had them both at once--would surely have seen them both through." This beautifully told sad story could have been conceived and written only by Ian McEwan. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p><p>Ian McEwan is the bestselling author of seventeen books, including the novels&nbsp;<i>Nutshell</i>;&nbsp;<i>The Children Act</i>;&nbsp;<i>Sweet Tooth</i>;&nbsp;<i>Solar</i>, winner of the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize;&nbsp;<i>On Chesil Beach</i>;&nbsp;<i>Saturday</i>;&nbsp;<i>Atonement</i>, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award and the W.

He writes a weekly column on the web that reaches thousands of people all over&nbsp;the world. To join his online audience, go to www.JohnShelbySpong.com. He lives with his wife, Christine, in New Jersey.</p>The intense devotion of the former Episcopal bishop of Newark to his subject is apparent. In his prologue, the author's voice expresses the intimacy of his commitment to Jesus, as well as his struggle for a personal appreciation of Him amid the Christian church's institutional appropriation of Him. Alan Sklar takes over in Part 1 as narrator. He conveys the appropriate sense of drama and emphasis, as well as excellent Hebrew pronunciation, with a tempered edge the author seems to lack. The result is a more lucid, albeit equally passionate, presentation that both theologians and the lay listeners will find compelling. Music at the beginning and end of each CD enhances the text.

Many have celebrated his dramatic conversion from a life in the slave trade to his eventual work to end it. But often overlooked are Newton's forty years as a pastor ministering to parishioners and friends unsettled by the trials, doubts, and fears of life.<br><br>Newton is perhaps the greatest pastoral letter writer in the history of the church. He took up his pen day after day to help others fix their eyes on Christ, which, he writes, is the underlying battle of the Christian life.

As the Lord Jesus Christ, crucified and reigning, was the life-giving focus of the Evangelical Revival, and as George Whitefield was its supreme awakener, and John Wesley its brilliant discipler, so ex&#x2013;slave trader John Newton was its peerless pastoral counselor and perhaps the greatest Christian letter writer of all time. In his 768- footnote digest of the spiritual wisdom in Newton&#x2019;s thousand-plus published letters, along with his published sermons and hymns, Reinke distills a vast flow of pure honey for the Christian heart. This is a book to read over and over again.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>J. I. Packer,</strong> Board of Governors' Professor of Theology, Regent College</p><p>&#x201c;Linger long here.

A bold project, beautifully done. You know <em>about</em> John Newton; now you can be pastored by him. You will feel known by him. You will be encouraged that your struggles are like his and his congregants. And you will discover again that huge helpings of the beauty and love of Jesus are the perfect antidote for our self-consumed lives.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ed Welch,</strong>&nbsp;Counselor and Faculty Member, Christian Counseling &amp; Educational Foundation</p><p>&#x201c;The Christian life is <em>Christ</em>, as John Newton clarified so helpfully. If you are still treating Christianity as a strategy for your own self-improvement, this book will not satisfy you. But if you have despaired of yourself and are now clinging only to Christ, this book will refresh you. Newton&#x2019;s practical counsel, brought vividly to life again by Tony Reinke, will lead you into the green pastures and beside the still waters that are, at this moment, awaiting you in your all-sufficient Savior. For some readers, this book may just become the most important book, outside the Bible, they will ever read.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Raymond C. Ortlund Jr.</strong>,&nbsp;Pastor to&nbsp;Pastors, Immanuel Church, Nashville, Tennessee</p><p>&#x201c;Best known for the iconic hymn &#x2018;Amazing Grace,&#x2019; John Newton deserves to be equally known for his tremendous corpus of spiritual letters. In them, Newton&#x2019;s gifting as a pastoral cardiologist with few peers is on full display. Many of the main struggles and joys of the human heart have not changed. And, as Reinke ably shows, Newton&#x2019;s advice, given in a world somewhat different from ours, is still potent and relevant. Very highly recommended.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael A. G. Haykin,</strong> Professor of Church History and Biblical Spirituality, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;Newton&#x2019;s pastoral letters are a unique and rich resource for Christians today, and both of us owe them a debt too great to describe. However, they constitute a notoriously difficult body of work in which to navigate. Many a time you can remember some gem you have read in these letters but now can&#x2019;t locate. Here we have a guide to Newton&#x2019;s main themes and topics, as well as considered treatments of many of his most valuable letters. This is a welcome tool for Christian growth and discipleship.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Tim and Kathy Keller,</strong> Redeemer Presbyterian Church, New York City</p><p>&#x201c;This book is worth every minute of your time, whether or not you have any interest in John Newton. Reinke brings out Newton in all his cheer to minister to readers. The result is a Christ-exalting manual for growth into Christian joy, freedom, and fruitfulness. No, more than a manual, this is a work of beauty to be read again and again.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael Reeves,</strong> President and Professor of Theology, Union School of Theology, Oxford, UK</p><p>&#x201c;John Newton mentored his young friend William Wilberforce into politics, which eventually led to the abolition of the British slave trade. To this day, Newton&#x2019;s letters continue to disciple generations of Christians. This book draws together Newton&#x2019;s key life lessons in a way every Christian can apply. As a state governor, a former member of Congress, and a Christian in public service, I am reminded by Newton that we are never more valuable to our society than after we have been humbled by the amazing grace of God.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Mike Pence</strong></p><p>&#x201c;Reinke takes us well beyond the hymn &#x2018;Amazing Grace&#x2019; to explore John Newton&#x2019;s stirring pastoral ministry and soaring vision of the believer&#x2019;s life in Christ. I am delighted to recommend this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Thomas S. Kidd, </strong>Distinguished Professor of History, Baylor University</p><p>&#x201c;This book, by one of the brightest writers in contemporary evangelicalism, examines the life lessons of a hymn writer, a freedom fighter, and a gospel preacher. Even if you don&#x2019;t think you like church history, you will love this book. Reinke ties Newton&#x2019;s life and thought to practical applications for every believer. I encourage you to read and savor anew the grace that saved wretches like us.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Russell Moore,</strong>&nbsp;President, The Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention</p><p>&#x201c;You may think you are acquainted with John Newton: converted slave trader, pastor, writer of the hymn &#x2018;Amazing Grace.&#x2019; Get ready to meet the man you only think you know. Reinke guides us on a tour of Newton&#x2019;s theology through his life and letters. This book is pastoral theology at its finest. Newton was a man captured by Christ, exalting Christ, and caring for God&#x2019;s people by pointing them to Christ and him crucified.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>C.J. Mahaney,</strong> Senior Pastor, Sovereign Grace Church of Louisville</p><p>&#x201c;Although he authored what would become America&#x2019;s best-loved hymn, John Newton&#x2019;s contemporaries thought his best gift was letter writing. Rarely, if ever, has so much wisdom, love, sanity, balance, genuine affection, and wonderfully down-to-earth-because-full-of-heaven practical counsel been expressed in letters written in the English language. Underneath them all runs knowledge of the Word of God, a devotion to the Son of God, and a love for the people of God. Newton makes us feel, even two centuries later, that he was writing for us, and that he knew us well. Reinke has done the whole church a service by recovering Newton&#x2019;s letters from obscurity. <em>Newton on the Christian Life</em> is a taste of spiritual manna that will make us want to read the letters of Newton for ourselves.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Sinclair B. Ferguson,</strong> Chancellor&#x2019;s Professor of Systematic Theology, Reformed Theological Seminary; Teaching Fellow, Ligonier Ministries</p><p>&#x201c;This book presents valuable lessons from the ministry of John Newton. His perception of grace permeated his theology, his thinking, his experience, his hopes, his ministry, and even his dying. As Reinke writes, grace was &#x2018;the air he breathed.&#x2019; Here we catch glimpses into the workings of Newton&#x2019;s heart as he focused unreservedly on living for and through the Lord Jesus Christ.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Marylynn Rouse,</strong> Director, The John Newton Project</p></p><h2>Treehouses &amp; Playhouses You Can Build</h2><p><p>Treehouses &amp; Playhouses You Can Build shows how average "do-it-yourself" families can easily and affordably bring to life a "Hobbit's Treehouse," a "Pirate's Playhouse," or a "Crow's Nest" in their own backyards!

She explores the bond between mother and daughter, tenuous and unshakable at once, the alienating worlds that separate them, and the inescapable truth that we must lose the ones we love. In this quietly powerful tribute, Ernaux attempts to do her mother the greatest justice she can: to portray her as the individual she was. She writes, "I believe I am writing about my mother because it is my turn to bring her into the world."</p><p>"A stunning, emotional testament...that may move some readers to think of their own mothrs, even in a way they hadn't before."<br><br>Annie Ernaux's mother has just died. She is the only child, so it is up to her to make the final arrangements. And it is up to her to remember the proud, vibrant, intense, and difficult woman who once was her mother before age and illness vanquished her.

In general, such an occurrence would not be considered worthy of note, for people slept in towers all the time regardless of their current level of hair growth.<br><br>But in this particular case, it was not just the lady who slept. Almost everyone in the castle was magically sleeping, including the earl and countess and even Oxnard the guard, sitting in the kitchen with his mouth open, eyes closed in bliss, forever eating a piece of cherry pie, thereby creating with each passing minute a new world record for extended pie eating. Dogs, horses, children, knights, the bathing woman with soap in her eyes&#x2014;ï¿½everyone stood or sat or lay as if frozen in midaction, even when such actions were wildly inopportune.<br><br>The sole exception to the rule was the owner of a lonesome, warbling voice that could be heard every so often singing songs about remembered conversations, and how awfully quiet sleeping people tended to be, and how if someone didn&#x2019;t arrive with groceries soon, a certain someone would go to sleep and wake up dead, because ï¿½Oxnard the guard didn&#x2019;t have the keys to the tower door on him and they were nowhere to be found, plus the door itself had turned into solid stone, and all the other exits and castle walls were likewise impossible to manage and food was getting rather scarce, especially cheese.<br><br>There was little else of note besides the roses peeping out from the thick blanket of vines. The plush fuchsia blossoms were as beautiful as the thorns were sharp, and there was an abundance of them both, together with a cloying scent of attar and some dizzy, happy bees that seemed to possess a particularly charmed ability to not succumb to sleep and thereby patter to the ground like furry grapes.<br><br>There was also an abundance of portent swaddled about the place. Oodles of it. A surfeit, even.<br><br>Something would go down there soon.<br><br>But for now, the lady slept.<br><br>And drooled a little, probably.<br><br>2.<br><br>In a Squalid Barnyard in Borix, Redolent of Feces and Angst<br>The very worst part about drudgery, Worstley thought, was all the blasted drudging one had to do. Nothing joyful or fun or frolicsome around the corner for a lowly farm boy like him to look forward to. Just more drudgery of a mind-ï¿½sapping, soul-ï¿½sucking nature&#x2014;ï¿½and on a good day, no cause for involuntary upchuckery.<br><br>At least he&#x2019;d become somewhat accustomed to cleaning up the barnyard after his older brother, Bestley, had been stabbed in the heart by Lord Ergot for being too handsome. Some said barnyard duties were a step up from scrubbing the chimney, but Worstley wasn&#x2019;t so sure. It had been almost nine months since he&#x2019;d last vomited at the smell of assorted animal dung, but it was a constant struggle. It was still his least favorite chore, and he had to do it every other day: walk out there with a shovel and a sack among the goats and the pigs and the chickens and those dratted geese that goosed him whenever they could and scoop up whatever foul turds they had excreted since the last time he&#x2019;d cleaned up. And after that, the stables awaited the same routine. Only then could he have a sad waffle with no syrup on it for breakfast. He didn&#x2019;t think his mother made them properly: rumor in the village had it that waffles weren&#x2019;t supposed to be gray.<br><br>Like most cheerless days in Borix, the sky was the color of his mother&#x2019;s waffles. Worstley sighed at the clouds, exasperated. &#x201c;Would it kill you to let the sun shine through every once in a while?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>The demon geese honked at the sound of his voice and waddled his way, hissing, wings extended in a threat display. Worstley raised his shovel in front of him protectively. &#x201c;Go on, now. Shoo!&#x201d; he said.<br><br>As he fenced with their snapping beaks for a few seconds, he couldn&#x2019;t help muttering, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s got to be a better way to live than this.&#x201d; <br><br>Had he been in a musical, he thought, right then would have been the perfect time to sing a sad song about his woeful lot in life while emphasizing his eternal optimism and plucky heart. Although he&#x2019;d been born in this very barnyard&#x2014;ï¿½right there by the bucket of lumpy slop&#x2014;ï¿½he&#x2019;d always felt that he was meant for greater things, for some important purpose in the larger world. But there wasn&#x2019;t so much as a gap-ï¿½toothed troubadour around to strike an obliging opening chord rhapsodizing about his shining future. Lord Ergot had hanged them all for singing a little ditty about his poky short sword on his wedding day.<br><br>The geese fended off, Worstley checked the position of the black billy goat that occasionally found it amusing to ram him from the blind side and bleat a laugh as he clutched his back and winced. So far the goat was staying still&#x2014;ï¿½Gus was his name&#x2014;ï¿½but he was watching Worstley carefully from the other side of the barnyard near the fence. Or at least Worstley thought Gus was watching him; it was hard to tell. The goat&#x2019;s eyes never seemed to point in the same direction.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even think it, Gus,&#x201d; Worstley called.<br><br>Gus bleated, lifted his tail, and ejected a fresh pile of pellets out his backside.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, great. Why do people think animals are cute?&#x201d; Worstley wondered aloud. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re just nasty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aw, you got it easy, kid,&#x201d; a voice called from the fence to the right of the billy goat. Worstley&#x2019;s eyes slid in that direction and spied a diminutive form perched on a post. &#x201c;Goats ain&#x2019;t nothing. You want a dangerous pile of poop, wait until you get a load of dragon dump. It&#x2019;s hot and sulfurous and will burn the hairs right out of your nose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; Worstley asked. &#x201c;Better yet, what are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mere, kid. We gotta talk.&#x201d;<br><br>Keeping a wary eye out for attacks from geese and goat, Worstley drew closer to the fence to get a better look at the speaker.<br><br>Whoever she was, she had a set of double wings like a dragonfly&#x2019;s branching from her back, thin and translucent and veined with iridescent colors. They were the most beautiful things Worstley had ever seen. But the owner of said wings wasn&#x2019;t precisely the image of a proper fairy. A rather large mole with three stiff and proud hairs sprouting from it was rooted on the side of her left nostril. She had two black holes where teeth should&#x2019;ve been, and the three remaining molars were capped with gold. A single eyebrow not unlike a furry caterpillar wriggled about on her forehead.<br><br>Worstley would&#x2019;ve expected a glittering dress, dainty as a flower, but such was not in the offing. She wore a shirt that looked more like a used handkerchief, possibly swiped from someone with the plague. Her dull red pants ballooned over the thighs with the right leg bunched at the knee, revealing one blue threadbare sock. Her left pants leg fell to her ankle, but that foot was sadly sockless. Dirt rimmed her toenails, and she radiated a powerful funk that might&#x2019;ve been fungal in origin.<br><br>In short, she resembled a fairy about as much as Worstley looked like a prince.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; Worstley said.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course I am. I mean, apart from it being too blasted early, I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; She belched robustly. &#x201c;Ah, that&#x2019;s better.&#x201d;<br><br>Worstley blinked. &#x201c;Right. It&#x2019;s just that you don&#x2019;t look&#x2014;ï¿½&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like what? You&#x2019;d better not say a fairy, kid,&#x201d; she said, pointing a warning finger at him. The finger appeared to have a booger affixed to the tip. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a pixie. Name&#x2019;s Staph.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Staph?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I said. I&#x2019;m here to change your life, so we should probably get on with it so I can do something more productive with my day than talking to some scrawny cheesehole.&#x201d;<br><br>Worstley took a step back and looked around, suspicious. He&#x2019;d always dreamed of seeing a fairy, but never one that smelled quite so terrible. &#x201c;Is this a joke? You can&#x2019;t be a pixie.&#x201d;<br><br>Staph blanched and looked over her shoulder to make sure she still had wings. The motion made her wobble unsteadily on the fence post. &#x201c;Wings are still there. I&#x2019;m a pixie. What the puck else would I be? A bogie?&#x201d; She waggled her booger-ï¿½tipped finger threateningly at him and cackled.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you drunk?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not as much as I&#x2019;d like to be. Now look, kid, I&#x2019;m here to tell you something important. The good news and the bad news is that you&#x2019;re the Chosen One. You have a destiny, and I&#x2019;m here to bless you with it. Or curse you, whatever. Anoint you, let&#x2019;s say.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This has definitely got to be a joke. Who put you up to this?&#x201d;<br><br>The pixie rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Gahh, enough with that, all right? Nobody cares enough to play a joke on you, farm boy. This is destiny, all gen-ï¿½u-ï¿½wine and bona fide. What&#x2019;s so hard to believe?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought pixies were supposed to be named Butterblossom or something, and they&#x2019;re, like, I don&#x2019;t know . . . clean.&#x201d;<br><br>Staph&#x2019;s eyes bulged, and she held up her boogery index finger to scold Worstley. &#x201c;First, Butterblossom is a no-ï¿½talent harpy who invades homes at night and eats little kids&#x2019; pet hamsters.&#x201d; She held up another finger. &#x201c;Second, clean people have no fun and they only bathe because they can&#x2019;t think of anything better to do. But me, I&#x2019;ve seen some right bloody business and I know things.&#x201d;<br><br>Worstley shrugged and sighed and shouldered his shovel as if to say that if he had to deal with someone else&#x2019;s crap in the barnyard, it should at least be the physical rather than the metaphorical kind.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t believe me? Okay, I&#x2019;ll prove it to you.&#x201d; The pixie hawked up a loogie and spat it at his feet. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got more magic juice than a poisoned apple orchard in Chumpspittle. That&#x2019;s an ordinary goat over there, right?&#x201d; Staph pointed at Gus.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s kind of annoying, but otherwise, yeah.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Watch this.&#x201d; Staph glared at the goat and thrust out a hand in a clawed gesture. The billy goat rocked back as if struck and began to choke and spit, its yellow eyes rolling back in its head. The pixie produced a tiny wand and added some extra oomph to whatever she was doing, and the goat fell over.<br><br>Worstley dropped the shovel. &#x201c;Hey, what are you doing to Gus? Stop it!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Already done,&#x201d; Staph said as she lowered her hands and put the wand away.<br><br>Kneeling by the fallen and unbreathing billy, Worstley was unsure how to give mouth-ï¿½to-ï¿½mouth to someone with such thin, filthy lips full of such snuggled yellow teeth. Fortunately, Gus&#x2019;s round belly puffed up with air, and he rolled over and onto his callused knees, coughing.<br><br>&#x201c;You okay, Gus? C&#x2019;mon, buddy. If you&#x2019;re dead, Mom&#x2019;ll kill me. Or, actually, that might save me a step . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My name,&#x201d; said the goat, newly gifted with speech, &#x201c;is Gustave, not Gus. Get it straight, Pooboy.&#x201d; His voice was more cultured than Worstley&#x2019;s and filled the boy with rage that only made him sound more the bumpkin.<br><br>&#x201c;What did you&#x2014;ï¿½?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s your name, genius. Pooboy. As in the boy who scoops up my poo.&#x201d;<br><br>Worstley bristled and said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s so juvenile, you&#x2014;ï¿½&#x201d; but Staph cut him off before he could finish.<br><br>&#x201c;Look, will you forget the goat and listen to me now? He&#x2019;s not important, but I&#x2019;m for real, and I&#x2019;m telling you that you&#x2019;re the Chosen One. You have a special destiny. You&#x2019;re going to do great things.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, it wasn&#x2019;t me that chose you, okay? I just got sent here to do the deed. If I&#x2019;m gonna choose a hero, you can be darned sure it&#x2019;s not gonna be some whiny, pathetic punk named Pooboy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not my name! It&#x2019;s Worstley!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whatever. Like that&#x2019;s any better. Anyway, you&#x2019;re hereby anointed, so get to it, will ya?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Get to what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Saving the world. Or changing it. Or both. The aura kind of takes care of everything, and it&#x2019;s not my problem anymore. All&#x2019;s I need is a drink and the occasional night of debauchery at the local halfling bar and I&#x2019;m good. But you&#x2019;re not good, right? You&#x2019;re a pooboy named Worstley living in the most wretched earldom in Pell. Time to move on, don&#x2019;t you think?

A hideous crime is inviting death once more into Sheriff Joanna Brady's world. But this time the nightmares of her professional and personal lives are intertwining in ways too awful to contemplate, because one corpse is only the first piece in a twisted and sinister puzzle in which nothing seems to fit. And the next item on a killer's bloody agenda may well be Brady's own beloved daughter.</p></p><p>Joanna Brady returns in J.A. Jance's ninth adventure featuring the Arizona sheriff. Joanna and Butch, her new husband, are trying to build their dream house, adjust to their marriage, and cope with the preteen mood swings of Joanna's 12-year-old daughter, Jenny. During a Girl Scout camping trip to Cochise County, Jenny and another girl sneak out of their tents after lights out to have a cigarette and stumble on the body of a murder victim. Joanna is initially more concerned about her daughter's misbehavior than the murder at Apache Pass--after all, smoking can kill you--but then Dora Matthews, Jenny's coconspirator, is killed. Joanna's fear that her daughter might be in the killer's sights adds an extra dose of adrenaline to her efforts to find the man who left the body for Jenny and Dora to find. Add that worry to the sheriff's suspicion that Butch may be having an affair with a former girlfriend and you have the makings of a typical Joanna Brady novel: long on intelligence, empathy, and humanity and short on shootouts and suspense. Jance's other series, featuring Seattle cop J.P. Beaumont, features more intricate plotting and louder firepower. Brady's not as complex as Beaumont or as fully developed a character, but she leads with her heart, and her struggles to balance her personal and professional life bring interest. The Southwest landscape comes to life in the author's capable hands, and while the narrative's pacing is a little pokey, there's lots of lovingly evoked scenery to make it a pleasant trip. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p>J.

Wiley and Bent Formby deliver staggering findings: Americans really are sick from being tired. Diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and depression are rising in our population. We&#x2019;re literally dying for a good night&#x2019;s sleep.<br> <br> Our lifestyle wasn&#x2019;t always this way. It began with the invention of the lightbulb.<br> <br> When we don&#x2019;t get enough sleep in sync with seasonal light exposure, we fundamentally alter a balance of nature that has been programmed into our physiology since day one. This delicate biological rhythm rules the hormones and neurotransmitters that determine appetite, fertility, and mental and physical health. When we rely on artificial light to extend our day until 11 p.m., midnight, and beyond, we fool our bodies into living in a perpetual state of summer. Anticipating the scarce food supply and forced inactivity of winter, our bodies begin storing fat and slowing metabolism to sustain us through the months of hibernation and hunger that never arrive. Our own survival instinct, honed over millennia, is now killing us.<br> <br> Wiley and Formby also reveal:<br> -That studies from our own government research prove the role of sleeplessness in diabetes, heart disease, cancer, infertility, mental illness, and premature aging<br> -Why the carbohydrate-rich diets recommended by many health professionals are not only ridiculously ineffective but deadly<br> -Why the lifesaving information that can turn things around is one of the best-kept secrets of our day.<br> <br> <i>Lights Out</i> is one wake-up call none of us can afford to miss.</p><p>T.S.

It is impossible to sell living quarters elsewhere...To get the maximum effect, they have constructed their houses on stilts...People eager to live the longest have built their houses on the highest stilts...They celebrate their youth and walk around naked on their balconies...<br><br>In time, people have forgotten the reason that higher is better. Nonetheless, they continue to teach their children to shun other children from lower elevations. They have even convinced themselves that the thin air is good for their bodies, and following that logic, have gone on sparse diets, refusing all but the most gossamer food. At length, the populace have become thin like air, bony and old before their time.<br>-Alan Lightman,<br><br><i>Einstein's Dreams</i><br><br>In Woody Allen's classic film <i>Sleeper,</i> Miles Monroe, health-food-store owner and clarinetist, checks into Saint Vincent's Hospital in 1977 for a routine procedure.

That social security numbers classify every citizen in a Big Brother-like computer bank, that a fascist regime is controlling America, or that <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> released a study in 1998 concluding that fat may actually <i>protect</i> you from heart disease?

They even look better than we do. In this same tragicomic scenario, the wheat grass and tiger's milk are thinly veiled doppelgangers for our salads and Balance bars. In the 1970s, salads and Balance bars definitely would have been classified as "health food" for "health nuts." Everyone was very comfortable with the fact that there were "health nuts" and there were the rest of us. Today, if you're <i>not</i> into your health, you're considered nuts.<br><br>Today, <i>everything</i> is labeled "low-fat," "fat-free," "99% fat free," or "30% lower in fat," in an attempt to qualify as "health" food. Even fruit juice and dried pasta are sold as "fat-free," because we're all nuts. Your doctor and the media docs on TV all say, even after Dr. Atkins, <i>Protein Power,</i> and <i>Enter the Zone</i> have proven otherwise, that you can't get enough high-quality carbohydrates to lose weight unless you consume<br><ul><br> <li>5 to 7 servings of fruits and vegetables a day on top of the <br> </li><li>recommended 5 to 7 servings of grains and breads on top of <br> </li><li>pasta and wine.<br></li></ul><br><br>They never even figure in the Pepsi, Coke, Snapple, honey in your tea, and the high-fructose corn syrup that shows up as a preservative in almost all processed food.

Doesn't that seem like a lot?<br><br><i>What if all those low-fat promises of a long, cancer-free, diabetes-free lift in a beautiful, thin body, run by a strong, clear, non-hypertensive heart, were bogus from the start? What if carbohydrates, not fat, were the cause of obesity, diabetes, and cancer?</i><br><br><b>THE GOD MODULE</b><br><br>We think it's the exercise that's the key to why you feel so good while you're dying. It's also the reason why some people are able to stay on a low-fat regimen long enough to kill themselves. What could make a person do this?<br><br>The desire to be thin and well? No way.<br><br>Michael Persinger, Ph.D., professor of neuroscience and psychology at Laurentian University in Canada, has isolated an area of neurons in the brain's temporal lobes that repeatedly fire bursts of electrical activity when one thinks about God or has any feelings of spirituality. We scientists know this from CAT scanning praying monks, nuns, and schizophrenics as they "talk to God." Near the front of these temporal lobes is the amygdala, an almond-shaped organ that imbues events with intense emotion and a sense of meaningfulness. <br><br>Because of the way the temporal lobes are structured and hardwired to the amygdala, they are the most electrically sensitive regions in the brain. Dr. Persinger has personal knowledge of this because he created a helmet with coils of wire set just above the ears (picture Woody in <i>Sleeper).</i> By passing a carefully controlled electrical current through these coils, the doctor creates a pulsating magnetic field that mimics the firing patterns of the neurons in the temporal lobes. This creates a mystical spiritual experience, complete with a healthy dose of peace. Dr. Persinger's subjects report an "opiatelike effect with a substantial decrease in anxiety, a heightened sense of well-being, similar to reports of enlightenment."<br><br>While Dr. Persinger was doing his best mad-scientist impression, Vilayanur Ramachandran, Ph.D., director of the Brain and Perception Laboratory at the University of California at San Diego, was channeling heaven. Dr. Ramachandran announced in 1998 that he had discovered the "God module." This "module" is located in the brain in an area within the temporal lobes that becomes electrically active when a person thinks about God or spirituality or recalls a "mystical" experience. Wow, that sounds familiar.<br><br>We also know that stress, grief, and mostly a lack of oxygen also trigger heavy electrical firing in the same neighborhood as the God module. Since lack of oxygen brings on such neural bursts, some scientists believe this mechanism may account for many near-death experiences of euphoria and tranquillity. Also, sleep apnea in people with twitchy temporal lobes may mean that they hear someone calling their name as they fall asleep, or that they have an "out of body experience," such as flying, in their dreams. We're also going to tell you that the hyperventilation resulting from the exercise that goes along with urban yuppie low-fat living kicks the God module into play. That's why a runner's high is such a religious experience.<br><br>Your brain thinks you're dying. But you're just out of breath.<br><br>We're worried that you might be out of time, too.<br><br>The truth is, all of that exercise is doing more than making you high. It's exacerbating the burnout of your cortisol receptors. Running is a fear response. In the real world, it means something is after you; at least that's what your body and brain think. If you run long enough, all your systems believe you're not going to outrun that predator. The brain chemistry that follows extended running has evolved to make your exit from this world more pleasant. This means that oxygen depletion alone will kick in the part of the brain that takes you to heaven or, in this world, gives you a reason to keep running. The mechanism of brain chemistry that causes you to see God as you run out of oxygen evolved from programmed responsesresponses to environmental cues that no longer exist, responses that once upon a time might have kept you alive or made dying okay.<br><br>Now, they're killing you.<br><br><b>HEALTHY LIVING?</b><br><br>What other modern environmental cues are triggering ancient survival switches? The answer to that question is a chilling scenario worthy of a science fiction novel. Or a book like ours.<br><br>Working late in bright lights after dark, or watching David Letterman, or checking late-night Email, for even just half an hour, all register as the long days of summer to your inner environmental controls. This means that your brain will force you to seek energy for storage by eating sugar. Sugar (carbohydrates) is the only path to insulin release; insulin's job is to store excess carbohydrates as fat and cholesterol so you have something to live on when summer's over.<br><br>The abdominal fat pad common in insulin-resistant, high-cholesterol heart patients and Type II diabetics would, in another time and place, have served to keep internal organs warm and would have been utilized as energy during normal famine (winter). Increased intake of carbohydrates (sugar) is always dumped into increased cholesterol production, too, because the carbs lower the freezing temperature of the cell membrane. in the real world, you'd never have access to that much sugar unless it was summer before winter. You don't live in the real world.<br><br>The next time your doctor says your cholesterol is too high and you should cut back on the fat and exercise more, tell him he's mistaken. Tell him you're not sick, you're just going to hibernate and you don't want to freeze. He might laugh.<br><br>You, on the other hand, should be crying. You're in big trouble.<br><br>All of the systems that have evolved to keep you alive and have brought you to this point are shouting, <i>"Famine's coming!!!"</i><br><br>When you exercise day and night to stave off the weight gain your body and mind crave, you kick in your "stress response." The message you're sending to those systems is<br><br>"Oh, my God, a famine's coming <i>and there's a tiger chasing me!!"</i><br><br>Trust us, this is no solution.<br><br>In fact, exercise just might be the last nail in our collective coffins. The stress response enacted when you run for your life on that treadmill causes your cortisol levels to rise. If you do this once in a while, say, every ten days, the natural <i>episodic</i> cortisol response will keep your heart and brain healthy. But if you exercise like a maniac more that once a week, the high cortisol levels resulting from all of the chronic exercise actually mimics the stress of mating season, when the long hours of light and the competition (especially for males) kept cortisol at yearly highs. Sexual competition is the most stressful situation possible in nature, short of being killed. Mating season would come to naught without a fat base to nourish a pregnancy through the winter. So it's no coincidence that carbohydrate craving to put on fat, and high cortisol and high sex hormone levels all coincide. There must be a bun in the oven for most mammals by August or September in order for the baby to be born in April or May, in the spring, when food is plentiful.<br><br>So you're in the gym, it's November, it's anywhere from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m., and at least 3 bazillion watts of fluorescent lights are on and being intensified by reflecting mirrors that are shining right into your eyes and all over the skin of your overexposed body. You lift weights, run or jog on a treadmill or track, and, if you're really suicidal, you're on a StairMaster or you're spinning.<br><br>Know that, to your body and mind -- which were evolved over millennia to recognize cues in nature -- you are in a fight, a death match, just like the head butting wildebeests on the Nature Channel. You are in a fight for an egg, for immortality, or at least for a chance at the next round. This fight seems reasonable to your body because the long light at night (gym glare) means it's late summer and you must mate or go berserk. (Anybody who's witnessed the mating behaviors going on at the Vertical Club can't possibly question our hypothesis.) That's why cortisol is up during the day -- to supply glucose to muscles to fight or run away and to keep you calm for decision-making processes -- for mating. That's why, when we are constantly bathed in unending light, we all feel so antsy (read: paranoid, aggressive, hysterical, urgent), even those of us not exercising ourselves into oblivion.<br><br>In this chronic state, not only are you keeping your blood sugar up, taxing your insulin response system with cortisol's blood-sugar-mobilizing effects, you are actually becoming insulin-resistant as you exercise, too.<br><br>This fact means <i>exercise can make you fat.</i><br><br>While you're exercising like a maniac and living low-fat, if you even smell a cookie you gain weight-and you're pouring sex hormones, too, causing cancer and suppressing your immune system in the bargain. Chronic high cortisol also skews your time perception, making you feel continually rushed. It's the altered time perception that fosters much of the late-night stalling before bed, while you stay up under the impression that there must be more to do or that you haven't finished your work. Then you stuff yourself with more sugar because you haven't slept, and your insulin is sent even higher. We know this behavior alone makes you fat and sick.<br><br>Really, it's not the lack of excercise or the meat or the butter.<br><br>f0 <br><br>It's not fat at all.<br><br>Really.<br><br>If eating saturated fat caused obesity, we would already be well on our way to reducing obesity nutritionally.

Harris has been praised for his travel writing. In this exciting reissue of his classic travelogue, readers will come to treasure the rich insightful prose that is as textured as the Mississippi River itself. They will be taken by the hand by an adventurer whose lifelong dream is to canoe the length of this mighty river, from Minnesota to New Orleans. The trip's dangers were legion for a Black man traveling alone, paddling from "where there ain't no black folks to where they still don't like us much." Barge waives loom large, wild dogs roam the wooded shores, and, in the Arkansas dusk, two shotgun-toting bigots nearly bring the author's dream to a bloody . Sustaining him through the hard weeks of paddling were the hundreds of people who reached out to share a small piece of his challenge. Mississippi Solo is a big, rollicking, brilliant book, a wonderful piece of American adventure, and an unforgettable story of a man testing his own limits.</p></p><p>At 30 years old, Eddy Harris leaves his home in St. Louis and sets off into the chilly autumn for Lake Itasca. "I decided to canoe down the Mississippi River and to find out what I was made of," he writes. And <i>Mississippi Solo</i> is his stunning testament. Harris, who has authored <i>Native Stranger</i>, <i>South of Haunted Dreams</i>, and <i>Still Life in Harlem</i>, has been widely acclaimed since the first release of <i>Mississippi Solo</i> in 1988. It is greatly pleasing to see this important and stimulating first work revived. <p> As the Mississippi grows from its tiny source to a wide and powerful flow, Harris gains confidence as a canoeist, faith in his endeavor, and an understanding of his varying identity as an African American traveling alone from north to south in the United States. His exact and brilliantly revealing prose shows us how each bend in this mighty river turns itself within the paddler, how person and river are entwined--and who is in charge. </p><p> With an astute ear for irony, philosophy, and wisdom, as well as truths about the river, Harris takes the reader through locks and lakes on the northern Mississippi to the wild and swift and meandering river south of St. Louis. Songs of joy, troughs of loneliness, terrific storms, birdsong, paranoia, friendly captains, wild dogs, and ghosts of slaves fill his pages. Then we face off with two hunters, two shotguns, and Harris's single pistol... and still the river leads him on to New Orleans. Like the river he travels, Harris cuts through to the core of himself and his country. Triumphant! <i>--Byron Ricks</i></p>The true account of a young black man&#39;s journey in quest of a lifelong dream to canoe the length of the Mississippi River. &#34;I hope Mississippi Solo goes forth to encourage young Americans to . . . have an encounter with something real, as Eddy Harris did with the Mississippi River.&#34;--William Least Heat Moon</p><h2>Ray Bradbury&#39;s Something Wicked This Way Comes: The Authorized Adaptation (Ray Bradbury Graphic Novels)</h2><p><p>Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show howls into Green Town, Illinois, at three in the morning a week before Halloween.

It is believed that over 1 million mounds once existed, but today, perhaps only 100,000 remain. The ancient mounds and enormous earthworks associated with them are one of the most unappreciated archaeological treasures in the world. America has the largest and most complex formations of geometric earthworks in the world and the largest mound (near St. Louis) has a base larger than the Great Pyramid. This comprehensive text is a guidebook to mounds in 41 states and contains over 1100 site descriptions, many of which are large mound complexes with museums. The sites are arranged alphabetically by state and include Archaic, Adena, Hopewell, and Mississippian sites. It is the most comprehensive guide to America's mounds and earthworks in existence. The book includes nearly 900 photos, maps, &amp; illustrations and has 80 site reconstructions made by archaeological illustrators. Many rare photos of stone chambers and artifacts found in excavated mounds are included. An extensive index of 2300 entries listed by state contains all site and mound names along with locations. The book is a large hardcover (8.75 x 11.25) with green and red cloth with gold foil stamping (no paper jacket).

Are fungi food or medicine, beneficial decomposers or deadly "toadstools" ready to kill anyone foolhardy enough to eat them? In fact, there is truth in all these statements. In <em>Chanterelle Dreams, Amanita Nightmares</em>, author Greg Marley reveals some of the wonders and mysteries of mushrooms, and our conflicting human reactions to them.</p> <p>With tales from around the world, Marley, a seasoned mushroom expert, explains that some cultures are mycophilic (mushroom-loving), like those of Russia and Eastern Europe, while others are intensely mycophobic (mushroom-fearing), including, the US. He shares stories from China, Japan, and Korea-where mushrooms are interwoven into the fabric of daily life as food, medicine, fable, and folklore-and from Slavic countries where whole families leave villages and cities during rainy periods of the late summer and fall and traipse into the forests for mushroom-collecting excursions.</p> <p>From the famous Amanita phalloides (aka "the Death Cap"), reputed killer of Emperor Claudius in the first century AD, to the beloved chanterelle (cantharellus cibarius) known by at least eighty-nine different common names in almost twenty-five languages, <em>Chanterelle Dreams, Amanita Nightmares</em> explores the ways that mushrooms have shaped societies all over the globe.</p> <p>This fascinating and fresh look at mushrooms-their natural history, their uses and abuses, their pleasures and dangers-is a splendid introduction to both fungi themselves and to our human fascination with them. From useful descriptions of the most foolproof edible species to revealing stories about hallucinogenic or poisonous, yet often beautiful, fungi, Marley's long and passionate experience will inform and inspire readers with the stories of these dark and mysterious denizens of our forest floor.</p></p><p><p>Greg Marley has a passion for mushrooms that dates to 1971, the year he left his native New Mexico and spent the summer in the verdant woods of central New York. Since then, he has become an avid student and teacher of mycology, as well as a mushroom identification consultant to the Northern New England Poison Control Center and owner of Mushrooms for Health, a company that provides education and products made with Maine medicinal mushrooms. Marley is the author of <em>Mushrooms for Health: Medical Secrets of Northeastern Fungi</em> and <em>Chanterelle Dreams, Amanita Nightmares: The Love, Lore, and Mystique of Mushrooms</em>.

Perhaps such evocative names as the &#x201c;Death Cap&#x201d; mushroom has something to do with this mycophobia.

Basic recipes for preparation (risottos, simple pastas, and the like) are included, enabling readers to get the most from their bounty. But Marley spends equal time with their more toxic and psychedelic brethren, describing key characteristics, common regions, and potential side effects, ensuring that initiates spend more time in the woods than the ER. While the book does have a set of color slides to aid in identification of edible and poisonous varieties, the sample pales in comparison to the many species Marley mentions.</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Booklist-</em></strong></p> <p>&#x201c;Mushroom lovers who can only get their fix by sampling the often paltry array that appears in their grocers produce section may be sorely tempted to indulge their mycophilia when they encounter some choice fungi in the wild.

Whereas some commentators have viewed the book of Ecclesiastes as an alien intrusion into the Old Testament, and have deemed it of little use for the New Testament believer, Benjamin Shaw does not hold to this misguided view.<br> In this commentary, designed to be used by non-specialists, he shows that this divinely inspired book is far from being the muddled collection of disparate voices it is sometimes presented to be. He demonstrates that in reality, Ecclesiastes is an integral part of the word of God, and conveys a very distinct message to all who are willing to listen to its wisdom.<br> Drawing on his expertise as a Hebrew scholar, Dr Shaw opens up the text in a fresh way, shedding light on what, for many Christians, may have a long been a mysterious and enigmatic portion of Scripture.</p><p>Benjamin Shaw is Professor of Hebrew and Old Testament at Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, Taylors, South Carolina, USA.

He joins the 1932 Great Apache Expedition on their search for a young boy, the son of a wealthy Mexican landowner, who was kidnapped by wild Apaches. But the expedition's goal is complicated when they encounter a wild Apache girl in a Mexican jail cell, victim of a Mexican massacre of her tribe that has left her orphaned and unwilling to eat or speak. As he and the expedition make their way through the rugged Sierra Madre mountains, Ned's growing feelings for the troubled girl soon force him to choose allegiances and make a decision that will haunt him forever.<br><br> In this novel based on historical fact, Jim Fergus takes readers on a journey of magnificent sweep and heartbreaking consequence peopled with unforgettable characters. With prose so vivid that the road dust practically rises off the page, <em>The Wild Girl</em> is an epic novel filled with drama, peril, and romance, told by a master. This is the novel your reading group will be talking about long past your discussion!</p><p>Following the success of <i>One Thousand White Women: The Journals of May Dodd</i>, Jim Fergus has once again combined fact, fiction, history, and landscape in <i>The Wild Girl: The Notebooks of Ned Giles, 1932</i> to bring to life a group of disparate people and an event made more real through his imaginings.<p> Ned Giles is a 17-year-old orphan whose father's advice in a suicide note was that he should "buy himself a good camera." Ned is working in the clubhouse at the Racket Club in Chicago when one of the members posts a notice: "The Great Apache Expedition: This expedition ... plans to go into the Sierra Madre Mountains on the boundary between Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico, to attempt to recover the seven-year-old son of Fernando Huerta...the boy having been stolen by the Apache Indians ... when three years old..." Ned decides to leave Chicago and present himself in Douglas, Arizona, where the expedition is being organized, in the hope of becoming the expedition photographer. He drives his father's Studebaker Roadster, the last vestige of his old life, and eventually fetches up in Douglas. What he finds there is every boy's dream adventure and then some.</p><p> Fergus sprinkles stock characters throughout the narrative: the hard-drinking, overweight newspaper man, Big Wade Jackson, who really does not want to put up with the hardships of the expedition and is only too happy to send Ned; Tolley, the gay preppy from Princeton, having been sent by his father in the hope that it would "make a man out of him"; Margaret Hawkins, a cultural anthropologist and Ph.D. candidate from the University of Arizona, who looks at the whole escapade as a field trip; and a mean-spirited Chief of Police, Leslie Gatlin. Into this mix are thrown two Apache guides: Grandfather Joseph Valor, wisely resigned to the world as it is and Grandson Albert Valor, Apache hothead.</p><p> The main evet of the novel is, however, La Niï¿½a Bronca, the wild girl of the title. She is treed by the hounds of Billy Flowers, who heard the Voice and left home and hearth to become a hunter of predators. He takes her to Douglas, bound hand and foot, and she is thrown in a jail cell. She bites anyone who comes near her, but Ned is finally able to wash and feed her. And so begins the central relationship of the story. It is decided that the expedition will trade this girl for the Huerta boy. Turns out that isn't as easy as it sounds.</p><p> There is a wraparound story here that is utterly meaningless--author's notes, a prologue, an epilogue, the author's apology to the Apache people and all sorts of extraneous claptrap that is needless clutter. The basic narrative is a good one; stay with that. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p><strong>Jim Fergus</strong> has been a freelance journalist for twenty-five years.

How do you separate it out from the cacophony of other voices you hear everyday, including those of your own desires?

Michael C. Harris&#x2019;s impressive Brandywine: A Military History of the Battle that Lost Philadelphia but Saved America, September 11, 1777, is the first full-length study of this pivotal engagement based upon primary source materials and a complete understanding of the battlefield&#x2019;s topography.<br><br>General Sir William Howe launched his campaign in late July 1777, when he loaded his army of 16,500 British and Hessian soldiers aboard a 265-ship armada in New York and set sail. Six difficult weeks later Howe&#x2019;s expedition landed near Elkton, Maryland, and moved north into Pennsylvania. Washington&#x2019;s rebel army harassed Howe&#x2019;s men at several locations, including a sharp skirmish at Cooch&#x2019;s Bridge in Delaware on September 3. Another week of hit-and-run tactics followed until Howe was within three miles of Chads&#x2019;s Ford on Brandywine Creek, behind which Washington had posted his army in strategic blocking positions along a six-mile front. The young colonial capital of Philadelphia was just 25 miles to the east.<br><br>General Howe initiated his plan of attack at 5:00 a.m. on September 11. Obscured by darkness and a heavy morning fog, he pushed against the American center at Chads&#x2019;s Ford with part of his army while the bulk of his command marched north around Washington&#x2019;s exposed right flank to deliver his coup de main, destroy the colonials, and march on Philadelphia. Warned of Howe&#x2019;s flanking attack at the last moment, American generals turned their divisions to face the threat. The bitter fighting on Birmingham Hill drove the Americans from the field, but their heroic defensive stand saved Washington&#x2019;s army and proved that the nascent Continental foot soldiers could stand toe-to-toe with their foe. Although more fighting followed, Philadelphia was doomed and fell on September 26.<br><br>Harris&#x2019;s Brandywine is the first complete study to merge the strategic, political, and tactical history of this complex operation and important set-piece battle into a single compelling account. Nearly a decade in the making, his sweeping prose relies almost exclusively upon original archival research and his personal knowledge of the terrain. Enhanced with original maps, illustrations, and modern photos, and told largely through the words of those who fought there, Brandywine will take its place as one of the most important military studies of the American Revolution ever written.</p><p>Michael C.

He lives in Pennsylvania with his wife Michelle and son Nathanael.&#x201c;The Battle of Brandywine was a pivotal episode in the Revolutionary War.

She&#x2019;s a hero of the form: the sudden fiction, the flash fiction, whatever it&#x2019;s being called these days. The stories are short. They defy logic. They thumb their nose at conventional sense, or even unconventional sense. But if sense is in short supply in these texts, that leaves more room for splendor and sorrow. These stories upend expectations and prize enigma and the uncanny above all else. The Williams epiphany should be patented, or bottled&#x2014;on the other hand, it should also be regulated and maybe rationed, because it&#x2019;s severe. It&#x2019;s a rare feeling her stories trigger, but it&#x2019;s a keen and deep and welcome one, the sort of feeling that wakes us up to complication and beauty and dissonance and fragility.&#x201d;</p><p>Diane Williams is the founder and editor of the distinguished literary annual, <i>NOON</i>, the archive of which, as well as Williams' personal literary archive, was acquired in 2014 by the Lilly Library.&nbsp;She is the author of eight previous volumes of short fiction.

She had glasses on. Everything she wore helped me decide to let her in.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wore flat black patent-leather shoes with pointed toes, with black stockings, wrinkled at the ankles, with silver triangles set in on top of the toes of the shoes to decorate them, and she had on a long black coat, and she was shorter than I am.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her skin was a bleak sort of skin, and there was no beauty left in her&#x2014;maybe in her body.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt that this lady is fast, because she was at the place where I keep my red rotary-dial phone before I was, after I said, &#x201c;The phone is in here.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, &#x201c;I know the number.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the arm of my sofa, she dialed while her knees were knocking into and tipping back onto two legs my too-small table, which my phone sits on, and my oversized brass lamp, which sits on the table too, with the huge shade, might have crashed. The lamp was clanging, ready to go. She got it back.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, <i>&#x201c;Merla!&#x201d;</i> into the phone receiver.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew it&#x2014;she must have known it&#x2014;Merla knew it too, that Merla was only a matter of one hundred to two hundred yards from my house, because this woman I had let in, she had told me right off the house number she was looking for. She was telling Merla that it was impossible to get to her, that there was no way on earth, that she had kept on running into this east-west street.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A nice picture,&#x201d; she said to me.

She missed going inside of it to see what was going on in each of the pictures in there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What this woman had done to me was incalculable, and she had done it all in a period of time which had lasted no more than five minutes, which so many others have done, coming in here only for the telephone, because I had waved at her while she was shouting at Merla, I had said, &#x201c;Would it help you to know the number of <i>this</i> house?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I had told this little person my wrong address, not because I wanted to, nor because of any need on my part to make up a lie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said 2-7-0 which is way off the track, except for two digits, but I had rearranged them, the 7 and the 0, but I did not know I had done that. All that I knew was that I had done something unforgivably uncivil.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a lapse to reckon with. I took her into my arms, so that she could never leave me, and then jammed her up into the corner with the jumble by the front door and held her in there, exhausting myself to keep her in there.

Except for once he took me, and my head was up almost under his arm, my neck was, and my hand went up his back and down his back, and he copied what I did to him on my back with his hand, so that I would know what it would be like, I would have an idea, and then I could run home to my marriage afterward, which is what I did before, after we were done with each other; and the way one thing leads to another in my mind, this means I should run to the man for more of it, but the way one thing leads to another, first I will tell my husband, &#x201c;I would not choose you for a friend,&#x201d; then I will run to the other man, so that I can hear him say the same thing to me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is unrequited love, which is always going around so you can catch it, and get sick with it, and stay home with it, or go out and go about your business getting anyone you have anything to do with sick, even if all that person has done is push the same shopping cart you pushed, so that she can go home, too, and have an accident, such as leaning over to put dishwasher powder into the dishwasher, so that she gets her eye stabbed by the tip of the bread knife, which is drip-drying in the dish rack. It is a tragedy to lose my eye, but this heroism of mine lasted only a matter of moments.</p><h2>Blockchain Technology Explained: The Ultimate Beginner&#x2019;s Guide About Blockchain Wallet, Mining, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Zcash, Monero, Ripple, Dash, IOTA And Smart Contracts</h2><p>Instead of talking about investing, this book will focus on how blockchain technology works and how it might be used in the future.

His major works include the long visionary poems &#x201c;Prometheus Unbound&#x201d; and &#x201c;Adonais,&#x201d; an elegy on the death of John Keats. His shorter, classic verses include &#x201c;Ozymandias,&#x201d; &#x201c;To a Skylark,&#x201d; &#x201c;Mont Blanc,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Ode to the West Wind.&#x201d; This comprehensive and informative new edition collects his best poetry and prose, revealing how his writings weave together the political, personal, visionary, and idealistic.</p><p><b>Percy Bysshe Shelley</b> was born in 1792 and published his first volume of poetry in 1809. He was expelled from Oxford University for his distributing a pamphlet entitled &#x201c;The Necessity of Atheism.&#x201d; Four months later, he eloped with and married Harriet Westbrook but later left her for Mary Wollstonecraft, future author of <i>Frankenstein</i>.

There is a world of difference between having to read a poet as part of your studies and picking one up for pleasure later, which is why this is such an important and definitive edition.

This course uses 17 classic movies (DVDs not included) to introduce and study the elements of literary analysis. The book contains a student section and an extensive teacher&#39;s guide. Each lesson includes questions for discussion and composition and extended activity suggestions for anyone wanting to use it as an Honor&#39;s course. Also included: plot summaries, glossary of literary terms, and final exam. This course will not only give students the tools to appreciate good books more fully, but will also equip them with the ability to discern underlying messages in movies, rather than simply absorb them. It also offers students with difficulty reading (such as dyslexia) or remembering what they&#39;ve read an opportunity to use their strengths by comprehending and analyzing stories appropriate for their age, not their reading level. The teacher&#39;s guide contains details about teaching, points to cover during discussions, and what to look for in compositions that make it easy to use by homeschooling families.</p><p>Kathryn Stout is a Christian educator, consultant, and speaker.

She graduated from Goddard College and studied poetry in the MFA Writing Program at Vermont College. She lives in Vermont with her partner, Drea, and their daughter, Zella.Before<br><br>June 16, 1975<br><br>Miles<br><br>His mother glides across the flagstone patio slowly, hips and long legs working in time with the music, a kind of undulating dance that reminds Miles of the way tall grass moves just before a thunderstorm. She clutches a drink in her hand&#x2014;ï¿½a mint julep in a sweating glass with daisies painted on the side. Captain and Tennille sing from the tinny portable radio that rests on the table: Love, love will keep us together.<br><br>She hums as she dances her way to the aluminum-ï¿½framed lounge chair. The brass elephant charm on her beaded bracelet swings, sniffing the air with its trunk. Miles loves the elephant bracelet. She won&#x2019;t say where she got it, but she&#x2019;s been wearing it for almost a month now.<br><br>In her white cotton dress and gold sandals, she looks like one of the goddesses from the book of Greek mythology Miles has been reading. Aphrodite maybe. Her toenails are painted a rich velvety plum, her skin is a summery bronze, and her light brown hair is highlighted with gold and feathered back from her face. She sits down in the chair, resting her glass on the little metal table beside it. She picks up the pack of Pall Malls and shakes out a cigarette.<br><br>Miles holds his breath and shifts uneasily in his hiding spot. He&#x2019;s on his belly behind the rock garden, stretched out like a snake as he watches his mother across the yard.<br><br>She&#x2019;d promised to quit. But she keeps cigarettes hidden in the bookcase, behind the huge, leather-ï¿½bound classics no one in their house ever reads: Moby-ï¿½Dick, David Copperfield.<br><br>Miles has told his mother about the movie they watched in health class&#x2014;ï¿½the images of the healthy, pink lungs and the dark, mottled smokers&#x2019; lungs. He hates to imagine that his mother&#x2019;s lungs might look like the sooty inside of a chimney; worse still, he hates to think of her dying, which is what his health teacher, Mrs. Molette, says will happen if you smoke. Your lungs will become blackened. Diseased. They will not work anymore. They will not bring oxygen to your body. Without oxygen, you die.<br><br>&#x201c;And I might get hit by a bus, too,&#x201d; his mother had said when he repeated this. &#x201c;Or struck by lightning. Or the brakes could go out on my car and I could go over a cliff.&#x201d;<br><br>Miles has to admit that this last scenario seems possible, too. His mother drives an old MG convertible coupe that was a wedding present from her parents. It&#x2019;s spotted with rust, and spends more time in the shop than out. Miles&#x2019;s dad wants to trade it in for something more practical&#x2014;ï¿½a nice station wagon maybe, like all the other moms drive. Miles tries to imagine his mom behind the wheel of a station wagon, like Mrs. Brady on The Brady Bunch, but his mom is no Mrs. Brady. And his mom loves her old MG. She&#x2019;s even named it. Isabella, she calls it, the name sounding musical. And sometimes, she&#x2019;ll say she&#x2019;s running to the store for milk and Frosted Flakes but then be gone for hours. Miles asks her where she goes and she says, &#x201c;Just driving. Just me and Isabella and the open road.&#x201d;<br><br>It seems like every week some new, impossibly expensive imported part breaks: a valve, a pump, a drum . . . things that, to Miles, sound more like body parts than car parts. But when a car part breaks, you take the car in to Chance&#x2019;s garage and they order a new part and replace it. You can&#x2019;t do that with blackened, cancer-ï¿½filled lungs.<br><br>He has to find a way to stop her.<br><br>That&#x2019;s why, earlier today when she was out at the market, Miles stole his mother&#x2019;s hidden pack of cigarettes. It was half-ï¿½empty, with only ten cigarettes remaining. He took out two, and carefully worked half the tobacco out of the paper. Then, just as carefully, he replaced it with the two paper packets he&#x2019;d made, each filled with black powder from his toy gun caps along with a pinch of sulfur from his chemistry set. Once the tobacco was placed back on top, they looked just like the other cigarettes. He wanted her to get a few good drags in before a small, stinking explosion would turn her off of smoking forever.<br><br>Ten cigarettes, two of which will explode. The chances she&#x2019;s chosen one just now are one in five. Miles likes numbers, understands odds. Hunkering down, he watches as she lights up.<br><br>He&#x2019;s wearing his Robin Hood costume: green corduroy pants that are a little too tight, tall cowboy boots, and one of his father&#x2019;s brown work shirts with a tag that makes Miles&#x2019;s neck itch, but he forces himself to be still, not to scratch. The shirt is cinched at the waist with a thick leather belt that holds his wooden sword. A quiver of arrows is on his back, and he holds his homemade bow in his hands. His father had helped him make the bow and arrows, had even made sharp metal arrowheads for them, reminding Miles that these were not toys and he needed to be careful. His mother wasn&#x2019;t impressed: &#x201c;Wonderful, Martin. And I suppose you&#x2019;ll deal with it when he kills one of the neighborhood cats by accident?&#x201d;<br><br>They argued, but in the end, Miles got to keep them.<br><br>His father loves the old Robin Hood movies, and he and Miles sometimes watch them together on the little TV in his dad&#x2019;s workshop. But lately, his father&#x2019;s been too busy. He&#x2019;s an appliance repairman, and drives a white van with his name on the side: martin sandeski, appliance repair and service. His father also uses the van for hauling equipment for the jazz quartet he plays in, Three Bags Full. His dad likes to tell the story of how he once played the trumpet onstage down in New Orleans with Count Basie. Miles&#x2019;s father is full of great stories. Stories of jazz legends he&#x2019;s rubbed elbows with, or a producer he met at a little club in Albany, New York, who&#x2019;s working on pulling some strings to get Three Bags Full a recording deal. And the best story of all: that his grandfather had worked for Thomas Edison, the guy who invented the lightbulb and movies and records. &#x201c;He gave me some of Edison&#x2019;s original plans,&#x201d; Miles&#x2019;s dad claimed. &#x201c;Plans for a secret invention he was working on just before he died. They&#x2019;re worth a fortune. A million dollars, easy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are the plans for?&#x201d; Miles had asked once, when his dad had polished off a six-ï¿½pack of Narragansett.<br><br>&#x201c;A special sort of telephone. A telephone that does things no one would believe, impossible things.&#x201d;<br><br>Miles&#x2019;s mother had laughed. &#x201c;Stop teasing the boy with your stories, Marty.&#x201d; They were sitting in the living room with the TV on, but no one was paying attention.<br><br>His father had drained the rest of his can of Narragansett. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not teasing, one day you&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;<br><br>Miles&#x2019;s mother had told him she didn&#x2019;t believe the Edison plans existed (she&#x2019;d certainly never set eyes on them), and even if they did, no way were they actually from the real Thomas Edison. &#x201c;Honest to God, you can&#x2019;t believe half of what your father tells you,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, blowing out a stream of smoke, crushing a cigarette butt into the heavy glass ashtray on the coffee table with a little too much force.<br><br>Now, Miles peers anxiously through a clump of tiger lilies, waiting for the bang from his mother&#x2019;s cigarette.<br><br>He feels an odd combination of anticipation and guilt; though he knows he&#x2019;s doing this for her own good, it seems like a cruel trick to play. His mother is so easily frightened; Miles and his father tease her with rubber snakes in the bathtub, plastic spiders in the butter dish&#x2014;ï¿½practical jokes that always make her scream. Then, when she realizes it&#x2019;s a joke, she laughs so hard she becomes breathless. His mother is beautiful when she laughs, and there is something truly stunning about catching her in the moment her fear turns to blissful, almost hysterical, relief. It almost embarrasses him to catch her in these moments, like he&#x2019;s seeing something he shouldn&#x2019;t; it&#x2019;s almost like walking into the bathroom without knocking and seeing her just getting out of the tub.<br><br>Suddenly, a shadow moves over the grass, crossing the yard and moving stealthily toward the patio.<br><br>Could his father be home early?<br><br>He&#x2019;s supposed to be repairing a washing machine for Old Lady Mercier all the way across town. Then he was going to stop by the shop and work on an air conditioner a guy had dropped off.<br><br>No. This is not his father, nor is it a child from the neighborhood, or anyone else he recognizes.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a man.<br><br>A shorter, slighter man than his father. And this man wears yellow socks and black dress shoes that are too large for his feet, making an awkward flip-ï¿½flop sound as he walks. His trousers are also too long, but have been rolled up. With each step, there is an absurdly bright flash of yellow from each ankle. But the oddest thing about this man is not his too-ï¿½large shoes and yellow socks, or his quick determined walk toward Miles&#x2019;s mother reclining on the patio.<br><br>Covering his face, his whole head in fact, is a rubber chicken mask. The mask is white, the beak yellow, the comb and wattles red.<br><br>Miles feels as if he&#x2019;s somehow slipped into one of his Saturday morning cartoons. He watches as the Chicken Man approaches his mother from behind. She&#x2019;s lying on the lawn chair, eyes closed, sunning herself; oblivious.<br><br>Up until now, Miles hadn&#x2019;t noticed the man&#x2019;s hands. He&#x2019;s been keeping them tight to his sides, but now, in the right, Miles sees the bright glint of a blade.<br><br>Miles rises slightly and tucks one of his sharp arrows in the bow&#x2014;ï¿½his lucky arrow, the shaft painted black, the feathers red. He pulls back the string. The Chicken Man is directly behind her chair now, and he leans down to whisper something in her ear. Keeping her eyes closed, she laughs.<br><br>Then, in one swift motion, the Chicken Man draws the blade across her throat.<br><br>His mother&#x2019;s eyes dart open, frantic and disbelieving. The blood pumps from her throat, soaking the chest of her white dress and dripping through the yellow nylon webbing of the chair and onto the flagstone patio. Instead of a scream, all Miles hears is one final resigned sigh.<br><br>The arrow flies from Miles&#x2019;s bow, hitting the Chicken Man on the left side of his lower back, making him bellow. As Miles stands up on wobbly legs, the Chicken Man swivels his head and pulls the arrow out with a roaring cry. Then he looks right at Miles. Holding the knife in one hand, and the arrow in the other, he takes a step in Miles&#x2019;s direction.<br><br>Miles is trying to get his legs to run when there&#x2019;s a bright, explosive, sulfur-ï¿½scented POP-ï¿½POP! from the ashtray. The Chicken Man freezes, then takes off running back across the yard, rubber mask quivering, shoes flapping, socks glowing brighter than the sun.</p><h2>The Healthy Instant Pot Cookbook: 100 great recipes with fewer calories and less fat (Healthy Cookbook)</h2><p><b>Make delicious, healthy recipes faster and easier, and with less fat and fewer calories, using your Instant Pot multicooker.</b><br><br><b>You know your Instant Pot multi-cooker can do it all--and now it can do it healthier!</b><br><br>The Instant Pot is a digital multi-function cooker that can pressure cook, slow cook, sautï¿½, steam, and even make yogurt; it cooks significantly faster than traditional methods, and leaves food more flavorful and more nutrient dense.

Boorstin explores the development of artistic innovation over 3,000 years.

Boorstin brings his customary depth and range to this compelling book on Western art, taking on everything from European megaliths (Stonehenge, for example) to Benjamin Franklin's autobiography ("the first American addition to world literature"). Boorstin does not aim at being comprehensive--he much prefers to linger over certain "heroes of the imagination" as he surveys human accomplishment in the fields of architecture, music, painting, sculpting, and writing--yet <i>The Creators</i> certainly <i>feels</i> comprehensive, as Boorstin carefully places everything he describes within a grand tradition of aesthetic achievement. <p> Boorstin knows that good history demands good writing, and his prose makes this big book easy to absorb. "This is a story," he writes, "of how creators in all the arts have enlarged, embellished, fantasized, and filigreed our experience"--an apt description of the role art plays in our life and an equally apt description of the way Boorstin interprets it for readers.

We all like to think we would, but thousands of employees are blindsided by layoffs, reorganizations, and downsizings every day. There are millions on unemployment right now who most likely never thought they would be the one left holding a pink slip. Your career is in danger right now, simply because you have no way of knowing what to look for, no way of finding the true agendas that determine whether you are seen as an asset or a risk. Do you know what opinions your company has of you right now? Those opinions are actively determining your job security. Those opinions are built on the secret agendas within your company. This chapter reveals the secret methods that can be used toremove unwanted workers such as cleaning-house layoffs, underhandedly managing an employee out, and even making an illegal firing appear legal. If a company wants you out, there is always a way they can maneuver around the law. This chapter will tell you what to look for, and how to save your job. You could be making career-threatening mistakes right now. What you don't realize is that your company will never tell you when you've made one of these mistakes for fear of legal exposure. Since an employee is much less likely to sue if he thinks the job loss was due to impersonal business factors out of his control, companies spin the rhetoric we've all heard: "We've had to reorganize your department," "We just can't afford to keep you on right now," or "We've decided to go in a different direction and are eliminating your position." Those lines are rarely the truth. The truth is, your company knows exactly why some employees are kept while others are let go, and now it's your turn to learn those same secrets. First, you need to know what you're <i>really</i> up against. SECRET 1 The law cannot protect your job. Many employees mistakenly believe the law will provide them with protection from retaliatory or unfounded job loss. In many of today's workplaces, this is nothing but a false sense of security. With all their expensive attorneys and consultants, most companies have found many pathways and gray areas around an employee's "legal rights." Companies have learned to protect themselves fiercely from those they feel are out of alignment with what they value. If unfavorable judgments and opinions are allowed to progress, they can take you from someone the company has interest in, to sentencing you tothe sidelines, all the way to full persona non grata. Yes, companies do have blacklists. One of a human-resource department's secret objectives is to remove these unwanted employees while legally protecting the company. And most are very good at it. There are ways a company can remove you so you never know what hit you or what you did that cost you your job! Companies don't say "you're fired" anymore; it's too risky. The removal process is now much more subtle. You need to know what those subtleties are so you can tell when your career might be in jeopardy. Managing an employee out One of the preferred methods of removal is the one no one talks about: managing an employee out. It can provide the most protection for a company with the least amount of paperwork. The basic concept is simple: make the employee's work life so difficult and unsatisfying he leaves on his own. If the company can get an undesirable employee to quit, they won't have to deal with the complexities, costs, and potential liabilities of firing him. No severance, no unemployment issues, little or no potential for liability. Most employees never see this one coming because in many companies it has become an art. The signs are always there, if you look for them. Too many employees keep their head in the sand because they don't want to believe their company could lose interest in them. That's a good recipe for being blindsided with job loss. Here are just a few signs that you might be in the process of being managed out: <i></i> DANGER SIGN 1: You're feeling grossly ignored, overworked, underpaid, or set up to be unsuccessful. <i></i> DANGER SIGN 2: Your boss doesn't seem to like you or pay attention to you the way he does to others. <i></i> DANGER SIGN 3: Your office is moved to an undesirable location or you are regularly given the assignments no one else wants. <i></i> DANGER SIGN 4: You're being given impossible tasks with unrealistic deadlines. <i></i> DANGER SIGN 5: Your boss surprises you with a scathing performance review. <i></i> DANGER SIGN 6: The company brings in someone to "help" you with your work and you find yourself training her in the nuances of your position and tasks. <i></i> DANGER SIGN 7: Your company moves you from department to department so you never have a chance to complete anything. I think you get the idea. It's every employee's worst nightmare. Shawn, an assistant with high aspirations, had his desk moved into a busy hallway even though there were other offices and cubicle spaces available. When he complained he couldn't get any work done, he received a speech about being a team player. Do you really think an employee the company valued and wanted to keep would be relegated to a hallway? No. He was actually in the beginning stages of being managed out because he had expressed negative views about company policies. He was unable to get his work done, rightly felt the company didn't value him, got fed up, and left. Mission accomplished. The company didn't have to fire him, didn't have to deal with unemployment, and got rid of its negativity problem. Lisa, a member of a fast-paced and high-producing customer service team, had her salary frozen and workload increased to twice that of other department members. After struggling for several months, she finally approached her supervisor to question the heavy workload and seemingly unfair distribution of tasks. Instead of receiving the help she was hoping for, her boss questioned her "fit" with the position and ability to handle the job. He put it in writing. It's no surprise anemployee would find this extremely frustrating. After all, that's the point. What Lisa didn't know was that her company had decided to manage her out because she was a gossiper, sharing all of the latest dirt on both the company and its employees. Not surprisingly, her gossip made her boss and the company executives nervous. They saw her loose lips as a liability. After doing twice the work of others only to be rewarded with a poor review, Lisa finally quit. The company didn't have to deal with firing her, and they no longer had a gossip problem. An employee who finds herself managed out ends up disliking her boss, distrusting the company, and is usually left feeling betrayed and confused. But it's a highly effective and relatively protected way to get rid of employees companies no longer wish to employ. The cold truth is, many companies would rather incur bad feelings than be faced with the possibility of a lawsuit, a messy firing, or keeping an employee they believe could become a liability. Yes, companies really do target people for removal, people they feel are negatively impacting the careful balance of success they've worked hard to create. Making an illegal firing "legal" In some companies managing out can even include making an illegal firing appear legal. It involves setting up an employee with documentation that makes him look like a poor performer so he can be fired "for good cause." This is especially important when the true reason for the termination has nothing to do with performance. In most states, even those allowing "at-will" employment, companies will tend to generate defensive documentation. "At-will" employment is a policy originally designed to protect the employer and employee by allowing either side to terminate the working relationship at any time for any reason. But it won't keep an employee from filing a discrimination claim after the fact. What all this legal maneuvering means is, even though companiesin "at-will" states are allowed to terminate without a reason, most like to generate paperwork that shows performance-based reasoning behind their decision to terminate--just in case. The easiest way to do this is by having documentation that shows the employee had low review scores, underwent corrective HR counseling, and was unsuccessful in his work tasks. This will greatly help a company's case if a claim is filed. However, this can be all too easily achieved by setting up the employee for removal beforehand: holding the employee accountable for things that have been allowed to slide in the past, assigning projects and task that have little or no chance for success or completion, coupled with a poor review. Within a staggeringly short amount of time, no matter how good your work actually is, there is enough "documentation" to make you look as though you haven't been doing your job. If all this hasn't caused you to quit, a company can now remove you in relative safety without having to worry about the potential for a lawsuit. These companies don't care if you think poorly of them, as long as you go away quietly. Legal restrictions are not going to stop some from protecting their interests. The myth of "performance improvement" Many companies have "improvement" programs for employees who have gone astray in their work performance, or are not meeting expectations. It is usually presented as an opportunity for an employee to make improvements before "further disciplinary action is taken," (a.k.a.: their employment is at risk). These programs can be very confusing for employees--and for good reason. In many cases, they're not real. Performance-improvement programs are too often nothing but a smoke screen, a protective mechanism. This type of action is much more about an employee's behavior than "work performance" or "expectations." Standard work performance issues usually only require acasual discussion with your boss, not meetings with HR and paperwork for you to sign. So, if you are in one of these programs you can safely assume that you've done something wrong they can't, and won't, openly talk to you about. They are not looking to help you "improve," they are moving you out. In many cases these programs are nothing more than an excuse to gather documentation so the company can legally fire you while providing the appearance that they've "made an effort" to help you improve (something a judge or lawyer will want to see). If your boss has put you in one of these programs and is documenting weekly meetings, hanging over your shoulder, and constantly on the phone with HR, it's over. You have lost the support of your company and it's not coming back. Neither is your job. Very rarely do employees survive this particular gauntlet, and in my personal opinion, you shouldn't bother trying. Use it as an opportunity to find another job. It's easier to find a job when you have one. (Psychologically, companies tend to be more interested in employees other companies also want. Looking for a job while you have one makes you appear more desirable, and they usually don't check references on your current employer.) So, while HR scrambles behind the scenes to put together enough documentation to deter a potential wrongful-termination suit, use this time to find a new company that will appreciate what you have to offer. Don't worry about being "wrong" Many employees worry about being wrong and jumping to another company prematurely. If you're afraid you read the signs incorrectly, you won't hurt your career by finding another job. You could actually preserve it. Telling your company about another job offer will let you know exactly where you stand. If your company truly values you, they will realize they need to start showing it. They will either state how much you mean to the company, or they will make you a counteroffer tokeep you with them. Always give your current company the chance to make a counteroffer, if you wish to stay. However, if you were right to look for a new job then you've just saved your career by jumping in time to keep yourself off unemployment and keep a damaging termination off your rï¿½sumï¿½. You'll know whether you were right or wrong the minute you tell your company about the other opportunity. If they seem happy for you, encourage you to take it, or don't make you a counteroffer, you did the right thing! SECRET 2 Layoffs aren't what you've been told. They go by many names these days: layoffs, reorganizations (reorgs). reductions in force (RIFs), downsizing, reengineering, even resizing. No matter what your company wants to call it, no matter how different they tell you each of these are, they're all the same. And they're not what you think they are. Most employees believe a layoff has nothing to do with performance or behavior, that it's caused by unfortunate external circumstances out of your control and that the company would have kept you on if it could have. This is exactly what companies want you to believe. But unless your company experienced catastrophic financial failure, this is rarely the case. This misunderstanding of what layoffs truly are has led to a critical lack of awareness in the important changes employees must make if they are to be protected in the future. No matter what reason your company gave you for a layoff, the real reason is most likely that they lost interest in you. Somewhere along the line, they got the idea that you were no longer worth investing in and opinions soured. Whether formalized or unwritten, there is <i>always</i> a "layoff list" of employees the company wouldn't mind getting rid ofwithout the potential for legal complication--which is precisely what layoffs provide. That's why human-resource departments secretly refer to layoffs as "cleaning house." Conversely, and more importantly, every company has a hidden indispensable list of protected employees who are virtually guaranteed job security no matter what. These are the favorites. So how can you tell if you are in danger of being laid off, RIFed, downsized, or reorganized? First of all, if you were on the indispensable list, you would know it. Companies have become very good at letting their most valuable assets know they are safe even in the face of financial difficulties. If your boss hasn't pulled you aside "confidentially," to put your mind at ease, you are not safe. The danger signs for layoffs are usually a combination of the following factors: <i></i> DANGER SIGN 1: You are highly compensated compared to others. <i></i> DANGER SIGN 2: You have a less-than-stellar relationship with your boss (who do you think decides who goes and who stays?). <i></i> DANGER SIGN 3: You have been openly negative about company policies or positions. <i></i> DANGER SIGN 4: The company numbers that support your position have recently dropped or disappeared. <i></i> DANGER SIGN 5: Your project was canceled or your primary client has decided to go "elsewhere." <i></i> DANGER SIGN 6: You've had a medical or disability leave within the last year, have filed a workers' compensation claim, or lodged any kind of complaint against your boss or the company. Several of these things might sound like retaliation--and they are. <i>The harsh truth is, layoffs provide a safe forum for cleaning house without fear of legal exposure, and for many companies that's too tempting to pass up.</i> Many times, layofflists include employees who have caused grief, been outspoken or nega...</p><h2>The Marlinspike Sailor [Second Edition, Enlarged]</h2><p>2012 Reprint of 1952 Edition.

The many, many Losers don't feel the pain yet, because they are still in Shock &amp; Denial. There are rumors in Washington that Gore's most trusted advisors have sealed him off so completely that he still firmly believes he Won....Which is True, on some scorecards, but so what? Those cards don't count....George Bush is our President now, and you better start getting used to it. He didn't actually steal the White House from Al Gore, he just brutally Wrested it away from him in the darkness of one swampy Florida night. Gore got mugged, and the local Cops don't give a damn. </p><p> Ho ho ho. Where the fuck did he think he was -- in some friendly Civics class? Hell no, he was in Florida, arguably the most vicious &amp; corrupt state in the Union....Not only that, but he was brazenly <i>invading</i> Florida, trying to steal it from right under the noses of the whole Bush family. It was a bold move &amp; brilliantly done, in some ways -- but then so was Lee's brave decision to invade the North &amp; attack Gettysburg. </p><p> Gore was Doomed in Florida, and he knew it about halfway through Election Night. The TV wizards had already given the state &amp; its 25 precious Electoral Votes to Gore, which gave him an early lead &amp; caused wild rejoicing in Democratic headquarters all over the country. </p><p> My own immediate reaction was bafflement &amp; surprise, and I think I almost believed it....But not really. The more I brooded on it, the more I was troubled by waves of Queasiness &amp; shudders of gnawing doubt. I felt nervous &amp; vaguely confused, as if I had just heard a dog speak perfect English for 30 or 40 seconds. That will get your attention, for sure....Some people get permanently destabilized by it: Nothing they see with their own eyes will ever look quite the same to them again. As in "I know that the object I'm looking at is an Egg -- but I also know that if it talks to me like a person, it is not an Egg." </p><p> There was an exact moment, in fact, when I knew Al Gore would <i>Never</i> be President of the United States, no matter what the TV networks said -- and that moment was when the whole Bush family suddenly appeared on TV and openly scoffed at the idea of Gore's winning Florida. It was Nonsense, said the Candidate, Utter nonsense....Anybody who believed he'd lost Florida was a Fool. The Media, all of them, were Liars &amp; Dunces or treacherous whores trying to sabotage his victory. They were strong words and people said he was Bluffing. But I knew better. Of course Bush would win Florida. Losing was out of the question. Here was the whole bloody Family laughing &amp; hooting &amp; sneering at the dumbness of the whole world on National TV. </p><p> The old man was the real tip-off. The leer on his face was almost frightening. It was like looking into the eyes of a tall hyena with a living sheep in its mouth. The sheep's fate was sealed, and so was Al Gore's....Everything since then has been political flotsam &amp; gibberish. </p><p> The whole Presidential election, in fact, was rigged and fixed from the start. It was a gigantic Media Event, scripted &amp; staged for TV. It happens every four years, at an ever-increasing cost, &amp; 90 percent of the money always goes for TV commercials. Of course, nobody would give a damn except politics is beginning to smell like professional football, Dank &amp; Nasty. And that's a problem that could haunt America a lot longer than four years, folks. </p><p> I am watching more NFL football this year but enjoying it less and less. There is something wrong with the game, something vital is missing, but I can't quite say what it is. No weekend goes by without at least one wild &amp; exciting game, plus one or two shocking upsets -- but somehow they all seem vaguely meaningless, like watered-down wine or weak whiskey. </p><p> I thought I had solved all my problems when I found a way to watch every game, every Sunday, all at once or separately. I had everything, right at my fingertips. I missed nothing. My friends called me "toggle-boy" because of my expertise with the channel switcher. They dropped by every Sunday to drink &amp; mooch &amp; gamble. It was like an impossible dream come true. Fred Exley would have loved it. </p><p> But still there was something wrong. Even reading the Sports section began to give me a queasy feeling. I came to secretly dread the coming of Sunday, although I never admitted that to anybody. It was too weird. </p><p> Only after long brooding &amp; extended medical analysis did I discover the obvious answer. It is the dangerous thinning of the NFL talent pool, a problem not totally unknown to the world of presidential politics. There are too many teams and not enough quality players. The League is destroying quarterbacks faster than colleges can churn them out. Every pro team <i>must</i> have two quarterbacks, because one of them is certain to get crippled or mashed by some steroid-crazed monster who weighs 388 pounds and runs faster than Deion Sanders and is desperate to hurt people.

The next MVP of the Super Bowl is just as likely to have been a full-time grocery store bagger last year as a Heisman Trophy winner. The teams change names &amp; locations every year. Even winning coaches go crazy with angst or get fired on the whim of a new owner. Players come &amp; go like substitute teachers or half-bright fashion models. Some beat their wives in public, and others get arrested for Murder. But the games go on like clockwork and the money keeps pouring in....Most stadiums are sold out every Sunday.

God is moving in the world in amazing ways. He determines the times and places of the nations and peoples of the earth. If God is the initiator of global disasters and wars and they are not random and purposeless acts, we should try to understand why they might be happening rather than ignore or oppose them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the<em> Mystery of Catastrophe</em>, you will learn to view catastrophes in an entirely new light. God uses natural and man-made disasters as his primary means of driving people to geographic locations of his choosing for the times of his choosing, to specifically position them to hear and believe in the one and only true God and salvation through his Son, Jesus Christ. When Turkey opened the floodgates and allowed over a million refugees from the Syrian conflict and greater Middle East to pour into the Balkans toward western Europe many churches jumped at the opportunity to reach out to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who were pouring through the region. It seems that God is setting the stage for the prophecy to be fulfilled, that the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come (Matthew 24:14).</p> <p> </p> <p>Regardless as to how one feels about the Muslim refugee crisis, it is clear that followers of Jesus are called to share the gospel with all people. You will learn to see gospel opportunities when many others see only chaos. The closer we approach the time of Jesus' return, the more natural and man-made disasters and calamities we will see. So also then will gospel opportunities increase if we have eyes to see them. The<em> Mystery of Catastrophe</em> will help you recognize what God is doing in the midst of the many storms that are even now gathering on the horizon.</p></p><p><b>Joel Richardson&nbsp;</b>is a New York Times bestselling author, filmmaker, and teacher.

In <i>One Renegade Cell</i>, Weinberg presents a state-of-the-art account of how cancer begins and how, one day, it will be cured.</p><p>"Cancer wreaks havoc in almost every part of the human body"--Robert Weinberg's opening remark is a chilling reminder of the pervasiveness of an all-too-familiar disease. Cancer touches most families, and if you have ever wondered why, despite so much time, effort, and money, it has proved such a seemingly intractable problem, then read <i>One Renegade Cell</i>, Robert Weinberg's masterful explanation. As director of the Oncology Research Laboratory at the Whitehead Institute and professor of Biology at MIT, Weinberg has been at the forefront of cancer research for well over a decade.<p> Unlike most diseases, cancerous tumors are not foreign invaders but "take on the appearance of alien life forms, invaders that enter the body through stealth and begin their programs of destruction from within." But as Weinberg shows, these are deceptive appearances. And since he is foremost a scientist, he finds the truth "subtle and endlessly interesting" and manages to convey fascination for something that most of us dread--cancer. Much of the present increase in cancer is due to increased longevity because "given enough time, cancer will strike every human body."</p><p> By telling the story of the historical discovery of cancer, Weinberg is able to introduce gradually the intricacies and complications of the genes and proteins involved (oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, etc.) for the general reader. He characterizes cancer cells as renegade because, unlike normal body cells, they "disregard the needs of the community of cells," they are "selfish and unsociable," and are only interested in "their own proliferative advantage." By comparison, normal cells hold down cell numbers by "inducing them to commit suicide" (apoptosis). </p><p> The understanding of cancer has been developed enormously over the last few decades by Weinberg and the worldwide community of researchers. As Weinberg eloquently shows, cancer research and its related disciplines "have moved from substantial ignorance to deep insight." <i>--Douglas Palmer, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>A Founding Member of Whitehead Institute, <b>Robert A. Weinberg</b>&nbsp;is a pioneer in cancer research most widely known for his discoveries of the first human oncogene&#x2014;a gene that causes normal cells to form tumors&#x2014;and the first tumor suppressor gene. Weinberg, who received his PhD in biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1969, has held research positions at the Weizmann Institute and the Salk Institute. In 1982, Weinberg helped found Whitehead Institute, joined the faculty as a professor of biology at MIT, and published his landmark paper "Mechanism of Activation of a Human Oncogene" in the journal <i>Nature</i>. In 1999, another major paper, "Creation of Human Tumor Cells with Defined Genetic Elements," was also published in <i>Nature</i>.</p><h2>The Mystery in Washington D.C.

Depression, despair, and thoughts of suicide often haunt LGBTQ Christians as they feel unable to imagine the possibility of living a happy, fulfilling life as an LGBTQ person of faith.</p> <p>As the gay daughter of a thirty-plus-year executive of conservative Christian organization Focus on the Family, Amber lost everything when she came out as gay in 2012. However, her journey to embrace her authenticity brought her fulfillment and wisdom to share. <em>Unashamed</em> serves as a guide for Christians considering coming out, tackling tough subject matters such as demolishing internalized homophobia, finding an affirming faith community, reestablishing your worth as a child of God, navigating difficult family conversations (especially in cases where family is involved in church leadership/ministry), and healing from the pain of rejection. <em>Unashamed</em> encourages LGBTQ Christians to embrace their unique identities and to celebrate the diversity placed inside them by God.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Amber Cantorna</strong>&nbsp;is a national speaker, a&nbsp;columnist for&nbsp;Patheos, and the author of&nbsp;<em>Refocusing My Family: Coming Out, Being Cast Out, and Discovering the True Love of God</em>.&nbsp;As a leader dedicated to supporting LGBTQ people throughout their coming out process, Cantorna uses her platform to inspire others and works to dissolve shame, foster self-acceptance, and generate a message of love and inclusion for all.&nbsp;</p><p>"The catalyst for Cantorna&#x2019;s guide was the realization that 'coming out to conservative families [is] tremendously underrepresented in the LGBTQ Christian community.' She goes a long way toward changing that with this extremely helpful and accessible guidebook that is filled with practical and commonsensical advice." <br>&#x2014;<em>Booklist</em></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Amber Cantorna has done it again. After the success of her book <em>Refocusing My Family</em>, Amber has returned with a practical, readable guide to the challenges of living authentically. In <em>Unashamed: A Coming-Out Guide for LGBTQ Christians</em>, Amber speaks with the wisdom of someone who has lived through the kind of shame only evangelicalism can impart. For those with the courage to let the world know who they are, <em>Unashamed</em> will guide you, lovingly and competently, one step at a time.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Paula Stone Williams, Pastor, TED speaker, LGBTQ advocate</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;As the mother of a gay son, I wish my child would have had <em>Unashamed</em> when he came out. With practicality, compassion, and wisdom that comes from personal experience, Amber Cantorna broaches coming out in a way that no other book has done. As both a mother and the leader of Free Mom Hugs, I will most definitely recommend this book to all LGBTQ Christians who are on the journey of embracing their deepest, truest selves.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Sara Cunningham, founder of Free Mom Hugs and author of <em>How We Sleep at Night: A Mother&#x2019;s Memoir</em></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;As the gay, closeted son of a Southern Baptist pastor, I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d ever come out. It was too scary. But in my&nbsp;late 20s, I began to&nbsp;plan my coming-out process. I was paralyzed with fear. I had no guidance, no resources, and very little confidence. I felt like the only person in the world who&#x2019;d gone through this.&nbsp;Thanks to Amber Cantorna&#x2019;s book <em>Unashamed</em>, no closeted Christian LGBTQ person should ever have to feel that way again. This book clearly and practically lays out a set of best practices for people who want to come out but aren&#x2019;t sure how.&nbsp;Coming out is never easy, but, thanks to Amber, it just got a whole lot easier.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;B. T. Harman, creator of the blog and podcast <em>Blue Babies Pink</em></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;This is Amber Cantorna at her best! She takes the nitty-gritty experiences that every LGBTQ person of faith experiences and breaks them down in an incredibly accessible way. Everyone who reads this book will leave with a greater understanding of what it is to be queer and a deeper understanding of steps to take that will lead toward wholeness in accepting God&#x2019;s love for all. Reading it feels like having a personal coach on all things LGBTQ and Christian.

No apologies. No atonement. Cantorna speaks plainly to the threats&#x2014;internal and external&#x2014;faced by many LGBTQ+ Christians and offers strategies first for survival and, in time, for roaring freedom.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&#x2014; Linda Kay Klein, author of&nbsp;<em>PURE: Inside the Evangelical Movement That Shamed a Generation of Young Women and How I Broke Free</em>, and founder of Break Free Together</p><br><br><p><em>&#x201c;Unashamed: A Coming-Out Guide for LGBTQ Christians</em> is bound to be an enduring addition to the resource shelf for LGBTQ Christians and others seeking to support them. Speaking with the authority of someone who has persevered through her own difficult coming out, Amber Cantorna puts into words the lessons many of us have had to learn through hard-fought trial and error. What&#x2019;s most compelling about the book is the breadth of wisdom it offers on the coming-out process, from the practical (such as considering one&#x2019;s safety and self-sufficiency before coming out) to the emotional (such as tending to one&#x2019;s own grieving heart in the face of rejection). This book is full of candid advice that is relevant to anyone navigating the challenging season of coming out.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;David and Constantino Khalaf, authors of <em>Modern Kinship: A Queer Guide to Christian Marriage</em></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Unashamed</em> is a heartfelt, supportive resource for LGBTQ Christians finding their place in the church and in the world.

In <em>Unashamed</em>, Amber Cantorna provides a clear, encouraging, and life-giving travel companion for LGBTQ Christians&#x2014;and the people who love them&#x2014;walking into the wide-open spaces of their truest selves. It will be an invaluable tool for those navigating the personal and relational challenges of coming out, and essential reading for allies hoping to walk alongside well.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;John Pavlovitz, author of <em>A Bigger Table</em> and <em>Hope and Other Superpowers</em>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Amber Cantorna&#x2019;s <em>Unashamed</em> is a rich yet intensely practical resource for every LGBT+ person who is wrestling to step out of the closet within a Christian context. For so many LGBT+ Christians, there is a profound sense of loneliness and disorientation as we seek to navigate coming out and reconciling our faith and sexuality. This book boldly shines the light of truth and love, helping to guide the reader on a path away from shame and toward wholeness as they embrace their God-given queer identity. I will be recommending this book to the many brave LGBT+ Christians I know who are embarking on this journey of liberation.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;Brandan Robertson, Lead Pastor, Missiongathering Christian Church in San Diego and author of&nbsp;<em>True Inclusion: Creating Communities of Radical Embrace&nbsp;</em></p></p><h2>Has the Church Replaced Israel?: A Theological Evaluation</h2><p><p>The relationship between Israel and the church continues to be a controversial topic led by this question: <i>Does the church replace, supersede, or fulfill the nation of Israel in God's plan, or will Israel be saved and restored with a unique identity and role?</i></p><p>In <i>Has the Church Replaced Israel?</i>, author Michael J.

Dr. Traina&#x2019;s Methodical Bible Study was not intended to be the last word in inductive Bible study; but since its first publication in 1952, it has become a foundational text in this field. Christian colleges and seminaries have made it required reading for beginning Bible students, while many churches have used it for their lay Bible study groups. Dr. Traina summarizes its success in this comment: "If the truths of the Bible already resided in man, there would be no need for the Bible and this manual would be superfluous. But the fact is the Bible is an objective body of literature which exists because man needs to know certain truths which he himself cannot know. There are two main approaches open to the Bible student. One is deduction, which begins with generalizations and moves for their support to the particulars. By its very nature deduction tends to be subjective and prejudicial. Its opposite, induction, is objective and impartial; for it demands that one first examine the particulars of the Scriptures and that one&#x2019;s conclusions be based on those particulars. Such an approach is sound because, being objective, it corresponds to the objective nature of the Scriptures." This book fills the need for a simple, practical textbook in hermeneutics. It encourages the serious Bible student to practice the best kind of hermeneutic, which allows the Word of God to speak for itself.</p></p><p>Robert A. Traina was Thompson Professor of Biblical Studies at Asbury Theological Seminary, Wilmore KY. He held the STB and STM degrees from Biblical Seminary in New York and the PhD degree from Drew Uinversity.</p><h2>The Meaning of the City (Jacques Ellul Legacy)</h2><p>Jacques Ellul, a former member of a Law Faculty at the University of Bordeaux, was recognized as a brilliant and penetrating commentator on the relationship between theology and sociology. In the Meaning of the City he presents what he finds in the Bible--a sophisticated, coherent theology of the city fully applicable to today&#39;s urbanized society. Ellul believes that the city symbolizes the supreme work of man--and, as such, represents man&#39;s ultimate rejection of God. Therefore it is the city, where lies man&#39;s rebellious heart, that must be reformed. The author stresses the fact that the Bible does not find man&#39;s fulfillment in a return to an idyllic Eden, but points rather to a life of communion with the Savior in the city transfigured. The Meaning of the City, says John Wilkinson in his introductory essay to the book, is the &#34;theological counterpoint&#34; to Ellul&#39;s Technological Society, a work that analyzed the phenomenon of the autonomous and totally manipulative post-industrial world. Ellul takes issue with those who idealistically plan new urban environments for man, as though man alone can negate the inherent diabolism of the city. For Ellul, the history of the city from the times of Cain and Nimrod through to Babylon and Jerusalem reveals a tendency to destroy the human being for the sake of human works. Nevertheless, continuing the theme of the tension between two realities that characterizes all his works, Ellul sees God as electing the city as itself an instrument of grace for the believer. William Stringfellow describes The Meaning of the City as a book of &#34;startling significance,&#34; which &#34;should rank beside Reinhold Niebuhr&#39;s Moral Man and Immoral Society as a work of truly momentous potential.&#34; Douglass D. McFerran adds that it is &#34;a book worth serious consideration by anyone interested in the relationship between religious commitment and secular involvement.&#34; And John Wilkinson sums it up: &#34;There are very few convincingly religious analyses of the sociological phenomena of the present day. . . . Ellul&#39;s biblically based sociology is today furnishing the matter for a large and growing group of social protestants, particularly in the United States.&#34;</p><p>Jacques Ellul (1912&#x2013;&#x2019;1994), a French sociologist and lay theologian, was professor emeritus of law and of the history and sociology of institutions at the University of Bordeaux. He wrote more than forty books, including The Technological Society, The Humiliation of the Word, and The Technological Bluff.</p><h2>Dawoud Bey: Two American Projects</h2><p>Dawoud Bey (b. 1953) is an American photographer best known for his large-scale portraits of underrepresented subjects and for his commitment to fostering dialogue about contemporary social and political topics. Bey has also found inspiration in the past, and in two recent series, presented together here for the first time, he addresses African American history explicitly, with renderings both lyrical and immediate.

In this volume Richard Bauckham, a leading biblical scholar and a bestselling author in the academy, illuminates main theological themes of the Gospel of John. Bauckham provides insightful analysis of key texts, covering topics such as divine and human community, God&#39;s glory, the cross and the resurrection, and the sacraments. This work will serve as an ideal supplemental text for professors and students in a course on John or the four Gospels. It will also be of interest to New Testament scholars and theologians.</p><p>"Bauckham offers a series of probing essays on the Gospel of John and its theology. They display the qualities that mark all of Bauckham's scholarship: a mastery of the field, an attention to exegetical detail, theological sophistication, and an independent judgment in constructive dialogue with an impressive array of Johannine scholars. Written in an accessible way, these essays will introduce Bauckham to those who do not know his work as they continue his stimulating contribution to the conversation about the elusive but engaging Gospel of John."<br>--<b>Harold W. Attridge</b>, Yale Divinity School<br><br>"These studies on the Gospel of John combine close attention to the details of the text with an open sympathy for its themes and emphases. They are models of theological exegesis."<br>--<b>Larry&nbsp;W. Hurtado</b>, New College, University of Edinburgh<br><br>"We can be grateful that Professor Bauckham has chosen to devote his considerable talents to an exploration of selected themes in Johannine theology. While not aiming to be comprehensive, this volume makes a significant contribution to the study of John's theological thought. No one interested in Johannine theology can afford to ignore this important collection of essays."<br>--<b>Andreas J. K&#x4e7;stenberger</b>, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>"Bauckham awakens readers to nuances in Johannine language and concepts of which habit has left us unmindful and makes visible the allusions to prophetic texts veiled by Johannine narrative art. He refreshes soteriological discourse about individualism and sacramental language and reopens the discussion of the relationship of the Johannine and the Synoptic Jesus. Bauckham's encapsulation of previous scholarship and presentation of new insights will delight and challenge both student and scholar."<br>--<b>Jo-Ann A. Brant</b>, Goshen College<br> <br>"Senior British New Testament scholar Richard Bauckham here offers eight essays on some of the most difficult themes in Johannine studies. His aim is not to deconstruct Johannine history but to elucidate the more nuanced meanings of the Gospel as we have it. From this point forward, no complete discussion of John and the Synoptics or Johannine sacramentalism (as well as the other subjects) can neglect this thorough, critical work."<br>--<b>Gary M.

What else would explain why he's playing baseball for the Oz Cyclones, with Dorothy as his captain, in the Ever After Baseball Tournament? But Alex isn't dreaming; he's just from the real world. And winning the tournament might be his only chance to get back there, because the champions get a wish granted by the Wizard. Too bad Ever After's most notorious criminal, the Big Bad Wolf, is also after the wishes. And anyone who gets in his way gets eaten! <br><br> From beloved baseball author Alan Gratz comes a novel in which classic literary characters are baseball crazy, and one real-world boy must face his fears and discover the surprising truth about himself.</p><p>Alan Gratz was born and raised in Knoxville, Tennessee. After a carefree but humid childhood, he attended the University of Tennessee, where he earned a College Scholars degree with a specialization in creative writing and later a Master's degree in English education. In addition to writing plays, magazine articles, and a few episodes of A&amp;E's City Confidential, Alan has taught catapult building to middle schoolers, written more than 6,000 radio commercials, and lectured as a Czech university. Currently, Alan lives with his wife Wendi and daughter Jo in the high country of western North Carolina, where he enjoys reading, eating pizza, and, perhaps not too surprisingly, watching baseball.In a strange, surreal world, Alex Metcalf finds himself joining a fantasy baseball league filled with figures from childrens literature and fairy tales. While playing the games, he meets Dorothy and other characters from the Oz series (not just the first book but the less familiar characters from the sequels) along with such stalwarts as Anne Shirley; Toad, from The Wind in the Willows (he thinks he is playing cricket); and the Cheshire Cat. More contemporary characters from the Redwall series, Madeleine LEngles novels, and others have walk-on parts. Meanwhile, the Big Bad Wolf is trying to escape from prison and exact a bloody revenge on Alex and the other players. The backstory, based on a dream, adds up to a goofy, rather ramshackle story that may be too esoteric for most young people. Still, inveterate readers may enjoy the fractured take on childrens literature.

Jacobs of Temple University takes us into the private world of those abducted by aliens, letting them describe in their own words what it is like to be abducted. Based on interviews with sixty individuals and more than 300 independently corroborated accounts, <i>Secret Life </i>presents the most complete and accurate picture of alien abductions ever compiled. Dr. Jacobs takes the reader on a minute-by-minute journey through a typical abduction experience and describes in detail the bizarre physical, mental and reproductive procedures that abductees claim have been administered by small alien beings. Jacobs draws from these interviews a profoundly unsettling reason behind the abductions: aliens are conducting a complex reproductive experiment involving the conception, gestation. or incubation of human and alien hybrid beings.</p><p>David M. Jacobs David M. Jacobs is an Associate Professor of History at Temple University in Philadelphia and a leading authority on unidentified flying objects. He is the author of <i>The UFO Controversy in America. </i> .Next time you glance at your watch and find a few minutes missing, better rush to your local hypnotist--you, too, might have been unwittingly kidnapped by a UFO. So Jacobs seems to suggest, estimating that over a million Americans have been abducted in recent years. ``We have been invaded,'' he proclaims, warning that ``the aliens have powers and technology greatly in advance of ours.'' Odd words, coming from a professor of history at Temple Univ., and a sign of the extreme oddity of the phenomenon, which Jacobs explores through extensive structural analysis. Each stage of a typical abduction, including the most sensational--the sexual encounters and reproductive experiments found in nearly all cases--are scrutinized through firsthand transcripts of hypnotic-regression interviews with more than 60 victims. The conclusion? That aliens are impregnating earth women in order to create quasi-human ``hybrids'' for some unknown purpose. The mind reels, but the sober, obviously terrified abductees make a strong case for the veracity of their experience. Jacobs's own presentation is a mixed blessing: His scholarship is punctilious, but he reveals the zeal of the converted in his debunking, after slight analysis, of all earth-bound explanations for UFO abductions (hysterical contagion, psychogenic fugue states, temporal-lobe dysfunction, and the like). By bringing solid scholarship to the pioneering efforts of Bud Hopkins and the hot prose of Whitley Strieber, this marks the next stage in UFO abduction research--and is just as likely to fly off the supermarket bookracks. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Many of the sources come from the period between 1400 and 1750, when more than 100,000 people - most of them women - were prosecuted for witchcraft in Europe and colonial America. During these years the prominent stereotype of the witch as an evil magician and servant of Satan emerged. Catholics and Protestants alike feared that the Devil and his human confederates were destroying Christian society. </p> <p>Including trial records, demonological treatises and sermons, literary texts, narratives of demonic possession, and artistic depiction of witches, the documents reveal how contemporaries from various periods have perceived alleged witches and their activities. Brian P. Levack shows how notions of witchcraft have changed over time and considers the connection between gender and witchcraft and the nature of the witch's perceived power. This second edition includes an extended section on the witch trials in England, Scotland and New England, fully revised and updated introductions to the sources to include the latest scholarship and a short bibliography at the end of each introduction to guide students in their further reading. </p> <p>The <i>Sourcebook</i> provides students of the history of witchcraft with a broad range of sources, many of which have been translated into English for the first time, with commentary and background by one of the leading scholars in the field.</p></p><p><p><strong>Brian P.

He has also edited <i>The Oxford Handbook of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America</i>(2013).</p><p>"To understand the history of witchcraft properly one has to read the original sources, and for this pursuit Brian Levack has produced the very best collection on the market.

You absolutely don't have to read The Mortal Instruments first; I've gotten very enthusiastic feedback from people who started with <i>Clockwork Angel</i>. However, if you are a fan of the Mortal Instruments, you'll see familiar family names--Lightwood, Wayland--and get to see what the ancestors of the characters you already know were up to in the Victorian age. There is at least one character who crosses over both series: the immortal warlock Magnus Bane. For those familiar with the Mortal books, it should be fun to meet him again; for those who haven't read them, it should be fun to meet him for the first time!<p></p> <b>Q:</b> Do you have a favorite character in <i>Clockwork Angel</i>? <p></p> <b>A:</b> Like Tessa, I'm torn between Jem and Will! They were both so wonderfully fun to write. Despite having a close brotherly bond, they're really opposites in personality. Will is a character who hides almost everything about himself; Jem is a character who is almost unendingly open and kind. Of course, when either kind of character reaches their breaking point, you have those moments of high drama and intensity that are catnip to writers!<p></p> <b>Q:</b> What characteristic or personality trait does Tessa possess that you most admire? <p></p> <b>A:</b> She is extremely persistent and unwilling to give up. When she's imprisoned, she doesn't stop trying to escape; she never stops trying learn new information; she never stops looking for her brother. She never fades quietly into the background; she plants her feet and asks questions--and gets answers, often from the unlikeliest of sources.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> How much research did you do for <i>Clockwork Angel</i>? What was the most interesting thing that you learned?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Starting in January of 2009 I took a six-month period of reading only books written during, or set in, the Victorian era--both fiction and nonfiction. I have an entire bookshelf now dedicated just to Victoriana. I also hired a research assistant who dug through primary source materials to find me letters and diaries written at the time. I was especially keen to find diaries of Americans traveling abroad, since Tessa is an American in London. I wanted to get a sense of what her impression as a foreigner would have been. One of the creepiest things I learned about was Victorian death photos, where they would prop up corpses to seem alive and take photos of them for their loved ones to have as keepsakes.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> Which type of character is the most fun for you to write--the hero or the villain? <p></p> <b>A:</b> There's a huge appeal to writing both, but there's something special about creating a really good villain. The villain stands outside society. He or she can say or do anything without fear of what the consequences will be for his/her relationships with the other characters. Sometimes the villain is the only one who can speak a vicious or painful truth and get away with it. <p></p> <br><b>Cassandra Clare</b> made her fiction debut with <i>The Mortal Instruments</i> series, which has been on many bestseller lists.

This remarkable book describes Fout&#39;s odyssey from novice researcher to celebrity scientist to impassioned crusader for the rights of animals. Living and conversing with these sensitive creatures has given him a profound appreciation of what they can teach us about ourselves. It has also made Fouts an outspoken opponent of biomedical experimentation on chimpanzees. A voyage of scientific discovery and interspecies communication, this is a stirring tale of friendship, courage, and compassion that will change forever the way we view our biological--and spritual--next of kin.</p><p>For three decades, primatologist Roger Fouts has been involved in language studies of the chimpanzee, the animal most closely related to human beings. Among his subjects was the renowned Washoe, who was &#34;endowed with a powerful need to learn and communicate,&#34; and who developed an extraordinary vocabulary in American sign language. Another chimpanzee, Fouts writes, &#34;never made a grammatical error,&#34; which turned a whole school of linguistic theory upside down. While reporting these successes, Fouts also notes that chimpanzees are regularly abused in laboratory settings and that in the wild their number has fallen from 5,000,000 to fewer than 175,000 in the last century.Marion Morra is the Associate Director of the Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, Connecticut.

But how do you go back further, into the centuries before the central registration of births, marriages and deaths was introduced in 1837, before the first detailed census records of 1841? How can you trace a family line back through the early modern period and perhaps into the Middle Ages? Jonathan Oates&#x2019;s clearly written new handbook gives you all the background knowledge you need in order to go into this engrossing area of family history research. <br><br>He starts by describing the administrative, religious and social structures in the medieval and early modern period and shows how these relate to the family historian. Then in a sequence of accessible chapters he describes the variety of sources the researcher can turn to. Church and parish records, the records of the professions and the courts, manorial and property records, tax records, early censuses, lists of loyalty, militia lists, charity records &#x2013; all these can be consulted. He even includes a short guide to the best methods of reading medieval and early modern script.<br><br>Jonathan Oates&#x2019;s handbook is an essential introduction for anyone who is keen to take their family history research back into the more distant past.</p><p>Dr Jonathan Oates is the Ealing Borough Archivist and Local History Librarian, and he has written and lectured on the Jacobite rebellions and on aspects of the history of London, including its criminal past. He is also well known as an expert on family history and has written several introductory books on the subject including Tracing Your London Ancestors, Tracing Your Ancestors From 1066 to 1837 and Tracing Villains and Their Victims.</p><h2>Country of My Skull: Guilt, Sorrow, and the Limits of Forgiveness in the New South Africa</h2><p>Ever since Nelson Mandela dramatically walked out of prison in 1990 after twenty-seven years behind bars, South Africa has been undergoing a radical transformation. In one of the most miraculous events of the century, the oppressive system of apartheid was dismantled. Repressive laws mandating separation of the races were thrown out. The country, which had been carved into a crazy quilt that reserved the most prosperous areas for whites and the most desolate and backward for blacks, was reunited. The dreaded and dangerous security force, which for years had systematically tortured, spied upon, and harassed people of color and their white supporters, was dismantled. But how could this country--one of spectacular beauty and promise--come to terms with its ugly past? How could its people, whom the oppressive white government had pitted against one another, live side by side as friends and neighbors?<br><br>To begin the healing process, Nelson Mandela created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, headed by the renowned cleric Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Established in 1995, the commission faced the awesome task of hearing the testimony of the victims of apartheid as well as the oppressors. Amnesty was granted to those who offered a full confession of any crimes associated with apartheid. Since the commission began its work, it has been the central player in a drama that has riveted the country. In this book, Antjie Krog, a South African journalist and poet who has covered the work of the commission, recounts the drama, the horrors, the wrenching personal stories of the victims and their families. Through the testimonies of victims of abuse and violence, from the appearance of Winnie Mandela to former South African president P. W. Botha's extraordinary courthouse press conference, this award-winning poet leads us on an amazing journey.<br><br><b>Country of My Skull</b> captures the complexity of the Truth Commission's work. The narrative is often traumatic, vivid, and provocative. Krog's powerful prose lures the reader actively and inventively through a mosaic of insights, impressions, and secret themes. This compelling tale is Antjie Krog's profound literary account of the mending of a country that was in colossal need of change.</p><p>In the year following South Africa's first democratic elections, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established to investigate human rights abuses committed under the apartheid regime. Presided over by God's own diplomat, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the first hearings of the commission were held in April 1996. During the following two years of hearings, South Africans were daily exposed to revelations and public testimony about their traumatic past, and--like the world that looked on--continued to discover that the relationship between truth and reconciliation is far more complex than they had ever imagined. <p> Antjie Krog, a prominent South African poet and journalist, led the South African Broadcasting Corporation team that for two years reported daily on the hearings. Extreme forms of torture, abuse, and state violence were the daily fare of the Truth Commission. Many of those involved with its proceedings, including Krog herself, suffered personal stresses--ill health, mental breakdown, dissolution of relationships--in the face of both the relentless onslaught of the truth and the continuing subterfuges of unrelenting perpetrators. Like the Truth Commission itself, <i>Country of My Skull</i> gives central prominence to the power of the testimony of the victims, combining a journalist's reportage skills with the poet's ability to give voice to stories previously unheard. <i>--Rachel Holmes</i></p>"One of the best books of the year."<br>--<i>The Economist</i><br><br>"This is a deeply moving account of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission--South Africa's attempt to come to terms with her often horrendous past. Antjie Krog writes with the sensitivity of a poet and the clarity of a journalist. Country of My Skull is a must-read for all who are fascinated by this unique attempt to deal with a post-conflict context. It is a beautiful and powerful book."<br>-- Archbishop Desmond Tutu<br><br>"Trying to understand the new South Africa without the Truth and Reconciliation Commission would be futile; trying to understand the commission without this book would be irresponsible."<br>-- Andrï¿½ Brink, author of<i> A Dry White Season</i><br><br>Antjie Krog has rendered the world a great service. This elegant manifesto for justice will haunt the soul long after the reading is done."<br>-- Douglas Brinkley, professor of history and director of the Eisenhower Center at the University of New Orleans<br><br>"Here is the extraordinary reportage of one who, eyes staring into the filthiest places of atrocity, poet's searing tongue speaking of them, is not afraid to go too far. Antjie Krog breaks all the rules of dispassionate recounts, the restraints of 'decent' prose, because this is where the truth might be reached and reconciliation with it is posited like a bewildered angel thrust down into hell."<br>-- Nadine Gordimer, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature</p><h2>The Wizard of Lies: Bernie Madoff and the Death of Trust</h2><p><p>Who is Bernie Madoff, and how did he pull off the biggest Ponzi scheme in history?</p><p>This question has long fascinated people, about the New York financier who swindled his friends, relatives, and other investors out of $65 billion.

The Spanish banking executives who visited him on Thanksgiving Day still want to withdraw their money. So do the Italians running the Kingate funds in London, and the managers of the fund in Gibraltar and the Dutch-run fund in the Caymans, and even Sonja Kohn in Vienna, one of his biggest boosters. That's more than $1.5 billion right there, from just a handful of feeder funds. Then there's the continued hemorrhaging at Fairfield Greenwich Group&#x2014;$980 million through November and now another $580 million for December. </p><p>If he writes a check for the December redemptions, it will bounce. </p><p>There's no way he can borrow enough money to cover those withdrawals. Banks aren't lending to anyone now, certainly not to a midlevel wholesale outfit like his. His brokerage firm may still seem impressive to his trusting investors, but to nervous bankers and harried regulators today, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities is definitely not "too big to fail." </p><p>Last week he called a defense lawyer, Ike Sorkin. There's probably not much that even a formidable attorney like Sorkin can do for him at this point, but he's going to need a lawyer. He made an appointment for 11:30 am on Friday, December 12. He's still unsure of what to do first and when to do what, but a Friday appointment should give him enough time to sort things out. </p><p>In his nineteenth-floor office on this cold, blustery Monday, Bernie Madoff starts going through the motions. Around him, the setting is incongruously serene: black lacquer furnishings against silvery carpets and darker gray walls, a graceful staircase in the center. His firm occupies the eighteenth and nineteenth floors of the Lipstick Building, a distinctive oval tower on Third Avenue at East Fifty-third Street. Around the curving walls of windows on each floor, slabs of glass hang from the ceiling to form bright offices and conference rooms. Hidden behind locked doors on the seventeenth floor is a bland set of cluttered offices that Madoff also rents, connected to the rest of the firm only by the building's main elevators and fire escapes. It is down there, far from Madoff's light-filled office, that his fraud is invisibly but inexorably falling apart. </p><p>A little before lunch, he talks on the phone with Jeffrey Tucker at Fair-field Greenwich. They've known each other for almost twenty years. </p><p>Madoff's controlled frustration sounds fierce over the phone lines. What the hell is this, $1.2 billion in withdrawals in just over a month? Hadn't the executives at Fairfield Greenwich been promising since June that they would "defend" against these redemptions? They're even taking money from their own insider funds! Some defense. </p><p>He threatens: Fairfield Greenwich has to replace the redemptions already piling up for December 31, or he will close its accounts. He will kill the goose supplying all those golden eggs for Tucker and his wife, for his younger partners, and for the extended family of Tucker's cofounder Walter Noel Jr. </p><p>He bluffs: "My traders are tired of dealing with these hedge funds," he says. Plenty of institutions could replace that money, and have been offering to do so for years. But he has "remained loyal" to Fairfield Greenwich, he reminds Tucker. </p><p>As calm as a losing litigator, Tucker assures Madoff that he and Noel are working on a brand-new fund, the Greenwich Emerald fund, that will be a little riskier but will produce better returns. It will sell easily, when the markets settle down. </p><p>Madoff scoffs at the notion that Tucker and Noel will ever raise the $500 million they hope for&#x2014;even though the partners are putting millions of dollars of their own money into it already. They'd better focus on hanging on to the money they are losing right now, Madoff says, or he is going to cut them off. </p><p>A shaken Jeffrey Tucker writes an e-mail to his partners a few minutes later. "Just got off the phone with a very angry Bernie," he tells them, repeating the threats. "I think he is sincere." </p><p>He isn't. The Fairfield Sentry fund will shut down before December 31, but it won't be because Tucker and his partners aren't "defending" against their redemptions. It will be because they have stifled their skepticism for twenty years, determined to believe that their golden nest eggs were safe with Madoff. </p><p>Sometime today, people down on the seventeenth floor who work for Madoff's right-hand man, Frank DiPascali, will get the paperwork done so that Stanley Chais, one of Madoff's backers since the 1970s, can withdraw $35 million from one of his accounts. Chais has been loyal to Madoff a lot longer than the Fairfield Greenwich guys. </p><p>Around 4:00 pm, friends and clients start to arrive for a meeting of the board of the Gift of Life Bone Marrow Foundation, which helps find bone marrow matches for adults with leukemia. Bernie and his wife, Ruth, support the group because their nephew Roger succumbed to the disease and their son Andrew had a related illness, a form of lymphoma. In ones and twos, the board members show up, climbing the oval stairway from the reception area on the eighteenth floor, where the firm's administrative staff is housed. </p><p>At the head of the stairs, they turn right and head for the big glass-walled conference room between Madoff's office and his brother Peter's office. Ruth Madoff arrives and joins them. Eleanor Squillari, Bernie's secretary, has arranged some soft drinks, bottled water, and snacks on the credenza near one of the doors. </p><p>Jay Feinberg, the foundation's executive director and a leukemia survivor himself, sits down at one end of the long stone table with a few of his staff members and his elderly father, a board member. Bernie is at the other end, with Ruth on his right. There are people here who were woven into every decade of Madoff's life&#x2014;Ed Blumenfeld, his buddy and the co-owner of his new jet; Fred Wilpon, an owner of the New York Mets baseball team and a friend since their kids were growing up together in Roslyn, Long Island; Maurice "Sonny" Cohn, his partner in Cohmad Securities since the mid-1980s, a friend who has shared so many jokes with him over the years and now shares his office space.</p><p>Ezra Merkin, the financier and conduit to so many Jewish charities, arrives and settles his bulk into the square black leather chair next to Ruth. The elegant stockbroker Bob Jaffe, the son-in-law of Madoff's longtime Palm Beach investor Carl Shapiro and a broker with Cohmad, sits nearby. A few other board members or volunteers find seats at the table. There is a little trouble with the phone, but finally they manage to link in Norman Braman, the genial former owner of the Philadelphia Eagles football team, who presumably is in Florida. </p><p>At this moment, most of the people around this table are Madoff's friends, his admirers, his clients. In a few days they, and thousands like them, will become his victims. Their wealth will be diminished and their reputations questioned. Their lives will become a nightmare merry-goround of lawyers, litigation, depositions, bankruptcy claims, and courtroom battles. They will all profoundly regret that they ever trusted the genial silver-haired man seated at the head of the table. </p><p>With Ruth taking notes, Madoff turns to the agenda&#x2014;fund-raising efforts and plans for the big annual dinner in the spring. A fund-raising committee is needed. "Who will take this on?" Madoff asks. Fred Wilpon agrees to do so. The rest of the discussion is routine, except that some members recall Feinberg passing around copies of the foundation's conflict-of-interest policy and getting a signed copy from each member for the file. </p><p>By six o'clock, they are done. Madoff escorts his wife and friends through the private nineteenth-floor exit. They head out into the winter night. </p><p>Tuesday, December 9, 2008 </p><p>Things are starting to slip. Madoff has planned to meet with the son of his friend J. Ira Harris, one of the wise lions of Wall Street and now a genial philanthropist in Palm Beach, but the visit is canceled. </p><p>Instead, Madoff sits down with his older son, Mark, and explains that, despite the recent meltdown in the market, he's had a very strong year with his private investment advisory business. He's cleared several hundred million dollars, and he wants to distribute bonuses to some employees a little earlier than usual. Not in February&#x2014;now, this week. He tells Mark to draw up a list of the trading desk employees who should get checks. </p><p>Troubled, Mark consults his brother, Andrew. The two men have seen their father tense up a little more every day as the market crisis has wrung them all out. Just a little liquidity strain on the hedge fund side, he told them last month. But he is clearly more than just worried; they've never seen him like this. And now he wants to pay out millions in early bonuses&#x2014;it doesn't make sense. Shouldn't he be conserving cash, with things as rocky as they are? He should wait to see how things look in two months, when bonus season arrives. But Bernie Madoff is an autocrat&#x2014; he is in charge, and he brooks no opposition. Still, the brothers decide they must talk with their father on Wednesday about their concerns. </p><p>After the markets close and the firm starts to empty out, Madoff walks across the oval area where the secretaries sit and enters Peter's office. Peter has aged and pulled inward in the two years since his only son died. He still carries Roger's photo in his wallet, one taken after leukemia had already left its stamp on his once-handsome face. For decades before that bereavement, Peter had been Bernie's right hand, his confidant, the technological guru of the firm, the "kid brother." </p><p>If Peter has not previously known about his brother's crime&#x2014;his lawyers will insist later that he di...</p></p><h2>Alice in Wonderland-Treasury of Illustrated Classics Storybook Collection</h2><p>This book is an adaptation of the classic novel Alice in Wonderland; Bored on a hot afternoon, Alice follows a White Rabbit down a rabbit-hole without giving a thought about how she might get out.

To the inhabitants of the Jovian moons, Galileo is a revered figure whose actions will influence the subsequent history of the human race. From the summit of their distant future, a charismatic renegade named Ganymede travels to the past to bring Galileo forward in an attempt to alter history and ensure the ascendancy of science over religion. And if that means Galileo must be burned at the stake, so be it. From Galileo&#x2019;s heresy trial to the politics of far-future Jupiter, Kim Stanley Robinson illuminates the parallels between a distant past and an even more remote future&#x2014;in the process celebrating the human spirit and calling into question the convenient truths of our own moment in time.</p></p><p>Kim Stanley Robinson is a winner of the Hugo, Nebula, and Locus awards. He is the author of nineteen previous books, including the bestselling Mars trilogy and the critically acclaimed <b>Forty Signs of Rain, Fifty Degrees Below, Sixty Days and Counting, The Years of Rice and Sa</b>lt, and <b>Antarctica.</b> In 2008 he was named a "Hero of the Environment" by Time magazine, and he recently joined in the Sequoia Parks Foundation's Artists in the Back Country program. He lives in Davis, California.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>The Stranger All of a sudden Galileo felt that this moment had happened before&#x2014;that he had been standing in the artisans' Friday market outside Venice's Arsenale and had felt someone's gaze on him, and looked up to see a man staring at him, a tall stranger with a beaky narrow face. As before (but what before?) the stranger acknowledged Galileo's gaze with a lift of the chin, then walked toward him through the market, threading through the crowded blankets and tables and stalls spread all over the Campiello del Malvasia. The sense of repetition was strong enough to make Galileo a little dizzy, although a part of his mind was also detached enough to wonder how it might be that you could sense someone's gaze resting on you.<br><br>The stranger came up to Galileo, stopped and bowed stiffly, then held out his right hand. Galileo bowed in return, took the offered hand, and squeezed; it was narrow and long, like the man's face.<br><br>In guttural Latin, very strangely accented, the stranger croaked, "Are you Domino Signor Galileo Galilei, professor of mathematics at the University of Padua?"<br><br>"I am. Who are you?"<br><br>The man let go of his hand. "I am a colleague of Johannes Kepler. He and I recently examined one of your very useful military compasses."<br><br>"I am glad to hear it," Galileo said, surprised. "I have corresponded with Signor Kepler, as he probably told you, but he did not write to me about this. When and where did you meet him?"<br><br>"Last year, in Prague."<br><br>Galileo nodded. Kepler's places of residence had shifted through the years in ways Galileo had not tried to keep track of. In fact he had not answered Kepler's last letter, having failed to get through the book that had accompanied it. "And where are you from?"<br><br>"Northern Europe."<br><br>Alta Europa. The man's Latin was really quite strange, unlike other transalpine versions Galileo had heard. He examined the man more closely, noted his extreme height and thinness, his stoop, his intent close-set eyes. He would have had a heavy beard, but he was very finely shaved. His expensive dark jacket and cloak were so clean they looked new. The hoarse voice, beaky nose, narrow face, and black hair made him seem like a crow turned into a man. Again Galileo felt the uncanny sensation that this meeting had happened before. A crow talking to a bear&#x2014;<br><br>"What city, what country?" Galileo persisted.<br><br>"Echion Linea. Near Morvran."<br><br>"I don't know those towns."<br><br>"I travel extensively." The man's gaze was fixed on Galileo as if on his first meal in a week. "Most recently I was in the Netherlands, and there I saw an instrument that made me think of you, because of your compass, which, as I said, Kepler showed me. This Dutch device was a kind of looking glass."<br><br>"A mirror?"<br><br>"No. A glass to look through. Or rather, a tube you look at things through, with a glass lens at each end. It makes things look bigger."<br><br>"Like a jeweler's lens?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Those only work for things that are close."<br><br>"This one worked for things that were far away."<br><br>"How could that be?"<br><br>The man shrugged.<br><br>This was interesting. "Perhaps it was because there were two lenses," Galileo said. "Were they convex or concave?"<br><br>The man almost spoke, hesitated, then shrugged again. His stare went almost cross-eyed. His eyes were brown, flecked with green and yellow splashes, like Venice's canals near sunset. Finally he said, "I don't know."<br><br>Galileo found this unimpressive. "Do you have one of these tubes?"<br><br>"Not with me."<br><br>"But you have one?"<br><br>"Not of that type. But yes."<br><br>"And so you thought to tell me about it."<br><br>"Yes. Because of your compass. We saw that among its other applications, you could use it to calculate certain distances."<br><br>"Of course." One of the compass's main functions was to range cannon shots. Despite which very few artillery services or officers had ever purchased one. Three hundred and seven, to be precise, had sold over a period of twelve years.<br><br>The stranger said, "Such calculations would be easier if you could see things farther away."<br><br>"Many things would be easier."<br><br>"Yes. And now it can be done."<br><br>"Interesting," Galileo said. "What is your name again, signor?"<br><br>The man looked away uneasily. "I see the artisans are packing to depart. I am keeping you from them, and I must meet a man from Ragusa. We will see each other again."<br><br>With a quick bow he turned and walked along the tall brick side wall of the campiello, hurrying in the direction of the Arsenale, so that Galileo saw him under the emblem of the winged lion of St. Mark that stretched in bas relief over the lintel of the great fortress's entryway. For a second it looked as if one bird-beast were flying over another. Then the man turned the corner and disappeared.<br><br>Galileo turned his attention back to the artisans' market. Some of them were indeed leaving, folding up their blankets in the afternoon shadows and putting their wares into boxes and baskets. During the fifteen or twenty years he had been advising various groups in the Arsenale, he had often dropped by the Friday market to see what might be on display in the way of new tools or devices, machine parts, and so on. Now he wandered around through the familiar faces, moving by habit. But he was distracted. It would be a good thing to be able to see distant objects as if they were close by. Several obvious uses sprang to mind. Military advantages, in fact.<br><br>He made his way to one of the lens-makers' tables, humming a little tune of his father's that came to him whenever he was on the hunt. There would be better lenses in Murano or Florence; here he found nothing but the usual magnifying glasses that one used for close work. He picked up two, held them in the air before his right eye. St. Mark's lion couchant became a flying ivory blur. It was a poorly done bas relief, he saw again with his other eye, very primitive compared to the worn Roman statues under it on either side of the gate.<br><br>Galileo put the lenses back on their table and walked down to the Riva San Biagio, where one of the Padua ferries docked. The splendor of the Serenissima gleamed in the last part of the day. On the riva he sat on his usual post, thinking it over. Most of the people there knew to leave him alone when he was in thought. People still reminded him of the time he had shoved a bargeman into the canal for interrupting his solitude.<br><br>A magnifying glass was convex on both sides. It made things look larger, but only when they were a few fingers from the glass, as Galileo knew very well. His eyes, often painful to him, had in recent years been losing their sharpness for nearby things. He was getting old: a hairy round old man, with failing eyesight. A lens was a help, especially if ground well.<br><br>It was easy to imagine a lens grinder in the course of his work holding up two lenses, one in front of the other, to see what would happen. He was surprised he hadn't done it himself. Although, as he had just discovered, it didn't do much. He could not immediately say why. But he could investigate the phenomenon in his usual manner. At the very least he could look through different kinds of lenses in various combinations, and simply see what he saw.<br><br>There was no wind this Friday afternoon, and the ferry's crew rowed slowly along the Canale della Giudecca and onto the open lagoon, headed for the fondamente at Porta Maghere. The captain's ritual cursing of the oarsmen cut through the cries of the trailing seagulls, sounding like lines from Ruzante. You girls, you rag dolls, my mother rows better than you do&#x2014;<br><br>"Mine definitely does," Galileo pitched in absently, as he always did. The old bitch still had arms like a stevedore. She had been beating the shit out of Marina until he had intervened, that time the two had fought; and Galileo knew full well that Marina was no slouch when it came to landing a punch. Holding them apart, everyone scream- ing . . .<br><br>From his spot in the ferry's bow he faced the setting sun. There had been many years when he would have spent the night in town, usually at Sagredo's pink palazzo&#x2014;"The Ark"&#x2014;with its menagerie of wild creatures and its riotous parties. But now Sagredo was in Aleppo on a diplomatic assignment, and Paolo Sarpi lived in a stone monk's cell, despite his exalted office, and all the rest of Galileo's partners in mischief had also moved away or changed their night habits. No, those years were gone. They had been good years, even though he had been broke&#x2014;as he still was. Work all day in Padua, party all night in Ven?ice. Thus his rides home had usually been on a dawn barge, standing in the bow buzzing with the afterglow of wine and sex, laughter and sleeplessness. On those mornings the sun would pop over the Lido behind them and pour over his shoulders, illuminating the sky and the mirror surface of the lagoon, a space as simple and clear as a good proof: everything washed clean, etched on the eye, glowing with the promise of a day that could bring anything.<br><br>Whereas coming home on the day's last barge, as now, was always a return to the home fire of his life's endlessly tangled problems. The more the western sky blazed in his face, the more likely his mood was to plummet. His temperament was volatile, shifting rapidly among the humors, and every histrionic sunset threatened to make it crash like a pelican diving into the lagoon.<br><br>On this evening, however, the air was clear, and Venus hung high in a lapis lazuli dusk, gleaming like some kind of emblem. And he was still thinking about the stranger and his strange news. Could it be true? And if so, why had no one noticed before?<br><br>On the long dock up the estuary he debarked, and walked over to the line of carts starting out on their night journeys. He hopped on the back of one of the regulars that went to Padua, greeting the driver and lying on his back to watch the stars bounce overhead. By the time the cart rolled past Via Vignali, near the center of Padua, it was the fourth hour of the night, and the stars were obscured by cloud.<br><br>With a sigh he opened the gate that led into his garden, a large space inside the L formed by the big old house. Vegetables, vine trellises, fruit trees: he took a deep breath to absorb the smells of the part of the house he liked best, then steeled himself and slipped into the pandemonium that always existed inside. La Piera had not yet entered his life, and no one before her could ever keep order.<br><br>"Maestro!" one of the littlest artisans shrieked as Galileo entered the big kitchen, "Mazzoleni beat me!"<br><br>Galileo smacked him on the head as if driving a tomato stake into the ground. "You deserved it, I'm sure."<br><br>"Not at all, maestro!" The undeterred boy got back to his feet and launched into his complaint, but did not get far before a gaggle of Galileo's students surrounded him, begging for help with a problem they were to be tested on next day in the fortifications course at the university.<br><br>"We don't understand," they wailed contrapuntally, though it appeared to be a simple problem.<br><br>"Unequal weights weigh equally when suspended from unequal distances having inversely the same ratio as the weights," Galileo intoned&#x2014;something he had tried to teach them just the previous week. But before he could sit down and decipher their teacher Mazzoni's odd notation, Virginia threw herself into his arms to recount in officious detail how her younger sister Livia had misbehaved that day. "Give me half an hour," he told the students, picking up Virginia and carrying her to the long table. "I'm starving for supper, and Virginia is starving for me."<br><br>But they were more afraid of Mazzoni than they were of him, and he ended up reviewing the relevant equations for them, and insisting they work out the solution for themselves, while eating the leftovers from their dinner, all the while bouncing Virginia on his knee. She was light as a bird. He had banned Marina from the house five years before, a relief in many ways, but now it was up to him and the servants to raise the girls and find them a way in the world. Inquiries at the nearby convents, asking for prenovitiate admissions, had not been well received. So there were some years yet to go. Two more mouths, lost among all the rest. Among thirty-two mouths, to be exact. It was like a hostel in Boccaccio, three stories of rooms all overoccupied, and every person there dependent on Galileo and his salary of 520 florins a year. Of course the nineteen students boarding in-house paid a tuition plus room and board, but they were so ravenous he almost always fed them at a loss. Worse, they cost time. He had priced his military compasses at five scudi each, with twenty more charged for a two-month instructional session, but considering the time it took from him, it had become clear that he made each sale at a loss. Really, the compasses had not turned out as he had hoped.</p><h2>Days of Awe: A Treasury of Jewish Wisdom for Reflection, Repentance, and Renewal on the High Holy Days</h2><p><p>Compiled by S.Y.

They blurred everything; redefined the foundations of her life.</p><p>Standing in Muirwin Delenoth, resting place of abhorrence, with Jeremiah clasped in her arms, she felt emotions as extreme as the dismay which had followed Thomas Covenant&#x2019;s resurrection and the rousing of the Worm of the World&#x2019;s End; as paralyzing and uncontainable as the knowledge that she had doomed all of her loves. But there, in Andelain, the scale of her distress had seemed too great to be called despair. Here, in the company of bones and old death, her glad shock at Jeremiah&#x2019;s restoration was too great and complex to be joy.</p><p>Stave of the <i>Haruchai</i> stood waiting with his arms folded, impassive as a man who had done nothing, and had never lost a son. Three Ranyhyn waited near him, watching Linden and Jeremiah with glory in their eyes. In the distant west, the sun drifted down shrouded in the hues of ash and dust, casting shadows like innominate auguries from the stone blades and plates which rimmed the hollow. Heaved aside by the deflagration of Jeremiah&#x2019;s construct, the skeletons of <i>quellvisks</i> sprawled against the far slope of Muirwin Delenoth as if they sought to disavow their role in his redemption&#x2014;or as if they had drawn back in reverence.</p><p>Such things were the whole world, and the whole world waited. But Linden took no notice. She was unaware that she had dropped her Staff, or that Covenant&#x2019;s ring still hung on its chain around her neck, holding in its small circle the forged fate of all things. She regarded only Jeremiah, felt only him; knew only that he responded to her embrace. A miracle so vast&#x2014;</p><p><i>I did it, Mom</i>. For the first time in his life, he had spoken to her. <i>I made a door for my mind, and it</i> opened.</p><p>Joy was too small a word for her emotions. Happiness and gratitude and relief and even astonishment were trivial by comparison. A staggering confluence of valor and trust had restored her son. At that moment, she believed that if the Worm came for her now, or She Who Must Not Be Named, or even Lord Foul the Despiser, her only regret would be that she did not get to know who her son had become during his absence.</p><p>Somehow he had weathered his excruciating dissociation. In graves he had endured what the Despiser and Roger Covenant and the <i>croyel</i> had done to him.</p><p>She was murmuring his name without realizing it, trying to absorb the knowledge of him; trying to imprint his hug and his tangible legacy of Earthpower and his unmistakable awareness onto every neuron of her being. He was her adopted son. Physically she had known every inch of him for most of his life. But she had never met the underlying <i>him</i> until this moment: until he had arisen from his absence and looked at her and spoken.</p><p>The way in which she repeated his name was weeping; but that, too, she did not realize. She was no more aware of her tears than she was of Stave and the Ranyhyn and passing time and the ancient ruin of bones. Holding Jeremiah in her arms&#x2014;and being held by him&#x2014;was enough.</p><p>She had no better name for what she felt than exaltation.</p><p>Yet the exaltation was Jeremiah&#x2019;s, not hers. He had become transcendent, numinous: an icon of transfiguration. He seemed to glow with warmth and health in her arms as if he had become the Staff of Law: not <i>her</i> Staff, runed and ebony, transformed to blackness by her sins and failures, but rather the Staff of Law as it should have been, pure and beneficent, the Staff that Berek Halfhand had first created to serve the beauty of the Land.</p><p>The gift that Anele had given Jeremiah elevated him in ways that Linden could not define. He had not simply become responsive and aware. He appeared to dismiss the past ten years of his life as if they had no power over him.</p><p>Such things could not be dismissed.</p><p>&#x201c;Chosen,&#x201d; Stave said as if he sought to call her back from an abyss. &#x201c;Linden Avery.&#x201d; An uncharacteristic timbre of pleading or regret ached in his voice. &#x201c;Will you not harken to me?&#x201d;</p><p>She was not ready to hear him. She did not want to step back from Jeremiah. He vindicated everything that she had done and endured in his name. If she withdrew from exaltation, she would be forced to think&#x2014;</p><p>And every thought led to fear and contradiction; to dilemmas for which she was unprepared. No one could endure what her son had suffered without emotional damage; without scars and scarification. Yet she could not discern damage. In her embrace, he felt more than physically well. He seemed entirely <i>whole</i>, mentally and spiritually intact.</p><p>That Linden could not believe. She knew better.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom.&#x201d; Like hers, Jeremiah&#x2019;s voice wept gladly. &#x201c;Mom, stop crying. You&#x2019;re getting me all wet.&#x201d;</p><p>For his sake, she tried.</p><p>Long ago under <i>Melenkurion</i> Skyweir, she had forgotten the sensations of being a healer. Although she had cared for her companions in various ways, she had responded to their injuries as if her own actions were those of a stranger. But she had not forgotten what she had learned during her years in Berenford Memorial, tending the wounded souls of the abused and broken.</p><p>Training and experience had taught her that an escape from unreactive passivity was a vital step, crucial to everything that it enabled&#x2014;but it was only the <i>first</i> step. When a crippled spirit found the courage to emerge from its defenses, it then had to face the horrors which had originally driven it into hiding. Otherwise deeper forms of healing could not occur.</p><p>She realized now that she was expecting a rush of agony from Jeremiah: the remembered anguish of every cruelty which the Despiser and Roger and the <i>croyel</i> had inflicted. That prospect appalled her.</p><p>But when she considered her son clinically, she recognized that the outbreak which she dreaded was unlikely. Immediate firestorms of memory were rare. More commonly, a new form of dissociation intervened to protect the harmed mind while its new awareness was still fragile. Full recall came later&#x2014;if it came at all. Jeremiah felt whole to her because his worst recollections had not arisen from their graves.</p><p>For all she knew, they might remain buried indefinitely.</p><p>Why, then, was she afraid? Why did she contemplate anything except her son&#x2019;s restoration? Why could she not be content with miracles, as any other mother might have been?</p><p>She could not because Lord Foul&#x2019;s prophecies might still prove true, if the Despiser contrived to recapture Jeremiah&#x2014;</p><p>&#x2014;or if events triggered more memories than he could withstand.</p><p>She had failed to resurrect Covenant without his leprosy. Other restorations might go awry. With or without Lord Foul&#x2019;s connivance, predatory pain lurked inside Jeremiah: she could not believe otherwise. Suffering as calamitous as his possession by the <i>croyel</i> might overtake him without presage.</p><p>For that reason, she needed to remain alert in spite of her gladness. But she did not know where to begin trying to identify the truths buried beneath her son&#x2019;s presence.</p><p>&#x201c;Chosen,&#x201d; Stave repeated more sharply. &#x201c;Linden Avery. I comprehend the force of your son&#x2019;s awakening, and of your reunion with him. Who will do so, if I do not? I, who have lost a son, and may only yearn bootlessly for his return to life? Nevertheless we cannot remain here.</p><p>&#x201c;It appears that the Falls have ceased. Yet should the Unbeliever fail in his quest, they will surely return. And the wider perils of the world will not await the culmination of your release from sorrow. The last crisis of the Earth gathers against us. Also the Ranyhyn are restive. I deem that they are eager to rejoin our companions, and that they discern a need for haste.&#x201d;</p><p>Long before Linden was ready to release him, Jeremiah withdrew. For a moment, he gazed at her with gleaming in his eyes like the stars on the foreheads of the Ranyhyn. Then he turned toward Stave.</p><p>Linden was too full of other emotions to be surprised when Jeremiah reached out and hugged the <i>Haruchai</i>.</p><p>Although Stave did not respond, he suffered the boy&#x2019;s clasp until Jeremiah let him go. But when Jeremiah stepped back, the former Master lifted his eyebrow as if he were mildly perplexed.</p><p>&#x201c;You are much altered,&#x201d; he remarked. &#x201c;Is your condition such that you are able to remember Galt, who kept the fangs of the <i>croyel</i> from your neck?&#x201d;</p><p>Jeremiah nodded. &#x201c;I remember. He&#x2019;s your son. He let himself be killed so Anele could get that monster off my back. So Anele could give me all this power.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;the hope of the Land.</p><p>Linden watched the boy with a kind of awe. Some part of him must have remained conscious throughout the long years of his dissociation. Other aspects must have been evoked or informed by the <i>croyel</i>&#x2019;s use of him. Otherwise he would not have been able to emerge so swiftly&#x2014;or to know so much.</p><p>&#x201c;Then,&#x201d; Stave said flatly, &#x201c;I am content that you are indeed restored.&#x201d;</p><p>As if in confirmation, the Ranyhyn tossed their heads, and Hynyn trumpeted an imperious acknowledgment. From among them, Khelen came forward and nudged Jeremiah, apparently urging the boy to mount.</p><p>Jeremiah, Linden tried to say; but she had no voice. She did not know where to begin. Too many aspects of her relationship with her son had taken on new meanings.</p><p>Briefly the boy stroked the young stallion&#x2019;s muzzle: a small gesture of affection. Then he turned back to his mother.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom.&#x201d; There were tears in his voice again, if not in his eyes. His grin fell away. With his halfhand, he pointed at the bullet hole over her heart. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I never wanted you to get shot. But I&#x2019;m glad, too. I needed you so bad&#x2014;&#x201d; For a moment, the color of his gaze darkened, hinting at black depths of pain. &#x201c;I needed you to come after me. I was worse than dead.&#x201d;</p><p>His pajamas remained torn and stained. The horses ramping across the tops were almost indecipherable. And Liand&#x2019;s blood still soiled the tattered bottoms, in spite of Linden&#x2019;s efforts to wash them. She could barely remember that the fabric had once been sky-blue. It would never come clean.</p><p>But before she could reply, Jeremiah shook his head hard; blinked until his expression cleared. Gesturing around him, he snorted, &#x201c;<i>Quellvisks</i>. They were good for something after all.&#x201d;</p><p>Something which Lord Foul had not foreseen. In a sense, the boy had reincarnated himself from the old bones of monsters.</p><p>Oh, my son. Linden needed to stop weeping. Really, she could not go on like this. When Stave said her name again, his tone had become more peremptory. And he was right. They could not linger here without food or water or their companions. The wonder of her son&#x2019;s emergence from his portal was a small detail compared to the threat of the Worm. The world&#x2019;s end would not pause for any instance of mere human exaltation and relief.</p><p>&#x201c;Say something, Mom,&#x201d; Jeremiah prodded. His tone suggested a teenager&#x2019;s impatience. &#x201c;Say anything. Tell me you heard Stave. He&#x2019;s right, we need to go.&#x201d; His next thought made him grin again. &#x201c;And I want to see the Giants&#x2019; faces when they see me. They are not going to believe it.&#x201d;</p><p>Linden tried to refuse. She wanted nothing except to concentrate on her son. Her thirst for the sound of his voice was acute. There was so much that she yearned to know about him. About what he had endured&#x2014;and how he had endured it. It did not matter where she began, as long as she could search for the truth.</p><p>I never wanted you to get shot.</p><p>But there was something else&#x2014;Something in Stave&#x2019;s tone nagged at the edges of her health-sense.</p><p>She absolutely had to stop crying.</p><p>When she rubbed at her eyes, the emptiness of her hands reminded her that she no longer held the Staff of Law.</p><p>She felt strangely reluctant to retrieve it. It represented responsibilities which were too great for her. Nevertheless she was capable now of many things that would have surpassed her less than an hour ago. She was still the same Linden Avery who had raged and failed and despaired; yet somehow she had also been made new. And watching over Jeremiah was a task to which she could commit herself without hesitation.</p><p>To meet that challenge, she might well need every conceivable resource.</p><p>Unsteadily she stooped to reclaim her Staff.</p><p>As her fingers closed on the engraved blackness of the wood, another faint pang touched her nerves: an evanescent breath of approaching <i>wrongness</i>. Frowning, she raised her head to scent the air, extend her health-sense.</p><p>The atmosphere had a brittle taste, as if it were compounded of a substance that might shatter. She knew that the season was spring; but that fact seemed to have no meaning on the Lower Land. Hideous theurgies and slaughter had made a wasteland of the entire region. Muirwin Delenoth was as desiccated as its bones: it had been shaped by death.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom?&#x201d; Jeremiah asked; but still she did not speak.</p><p>Drawing warmth and sensitivity from her Staff, Linden considered the slopes of the hollow, the ragged plates around the rim. Then she lifted her attention to the declining sun and the tainted hue of the sky. The pall of ash and dust overhead was wrong in its own fashion: it was unnatural, imposed by some force beyond the reach of her senses. But it was not malice; not evil or deliberate. The almost imperceptible frisson of <i>wrongness</i> rose from some other source.</p><p>&#x201c;Stave&#x2014;?&#x201d; She had to swallow hard to clear her throat. &#x201c;Do you feel it?&#x201d;</p><p>The former Master&#x2019;s silence was answer enough.</p><p>Slowly she turned in a circle, pushing her percipience to its limits. She expected the disturbance to come from the vicinity of Foul&#x2019;s Creche; from Covenant&#x2019;s search for Joan. But she felt nothing there. When she faced northwest, however, she found what she sought.</p><p>It was faint, almost too subtle to be discerned. Yet it was thin with distance, not weakness. The fact that she could detect it at all across so many leagues bespoke tremendous power. As soon as she tuned her nerves to the pitch of this specific malevolence&#x2014;and to the direction from which it spread&#x2014;she knew what it was.</p><p>It was Kevin&#x2019;s Dirt, and it came from Mount Thunder.</p><p>For the first time, Kastenessen was extending his bale over the Lower Land.</p><p>Repeatedly he had tried to prevent Jeremiah&#x2019;s rescue from the <i>croyel</i>. Now he was sending the fug of Kevin&#x2019;s Dirt to hamper Linden and the Staff of Law. When it spread far enough, his theurgy would numb her senses, and Mahrtiir&#x2019;s, and perhaps Jeremiah&#x2019;s. And it would aggravate Covenant&#x2019;s leprosy. If Joan did not kill him first. With forces drawn from She Who Must Not Be Named, the mad <i>Elohim</i> strove to ensure that Linden and her companions would not survive.</p><p>A shudder like a chill ran through her. Her fingers clenched the Staff until her knuckles ached. Reflexively she confirmed that she still had Covenant&#x2019;s ring. An old comfort, it had steadied her for years, until he had refused her.</p><p><i>&#x2014;the last crisis of the Earth.</i></p></p><h2>Eastern Wisdom, Modern Life: Collected Talks: 1960-1969</h2><p>Alan Watts introduced millions of Western readers to Zen and other Eastern philosophies, but he&#x2019;s also recognized as a brilliant commentator on Judeo-Christian traditions as well as a celebrity philosopher who exemplified the ideas and lifestyle of the 1960s counterculture. In this compilation of controversial lectures, delivered at American universities throughout the decade, Watts challenges readers to reevaluate Western culture&#x2019;s most hallowed constructs. Watts treads familiar ground, interpreting Eastern traditions, and also covers new territory, exploring the counterculture&#x2019;s basis in the ancient tribal and shamanic cultures of Asia, Siberia, and the Americas. In the process, he addresses some of the era&#x2019;s most important questions: What is the nature of reality? And how does an individual&#x2019;s relationship to society affect this reality? Filled with his playful, provocative style, the talks show the remarkable scope of a philosopher in his prime, exploring and defining the '60s counterculture as only Alan Watts could.</p><p>"Alan Watts begins with scholarship and intellect and proceeds with art and eloquence to the frontiers of the spirit."<br> -- <i><b>Los Angeles Times</b></i>Philosopher and author Alan Watts (1915-73) was instrumental in introducing Westerners to Eastern thought. Born in England, Watts studied in the United States, becoming an Episcopalian minister and professor before breaking new intellectual and spiritual ground over the course of writing more than 20 influential books. He was also an exceedingly popular speaker. His Sunday-morning radio program, "Way beyond the West," became one of public radio's longest-running series; he hosted national public television's <i>Eastern Wisdom </i>in Modern Life and was in great demand as a lecturer. A selection of Watts' energetic, provocative, and shibboleth-shattering talks is now in print for the first time, and his arguments remain vital. With disarming candor, intellectual delight, and spiritual acuity, Watts offers frank assessments of the church and keen elucidations of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taosim. He also explores essential perceptions and contradictions in "Philosophy of Nature," "Mysticism and Morality," and "Religion and Sexuality." In a time of raging fundamentalism, such erudite, witty, and positive inquiries into religion and right action are a balm and a light. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Her little sister Peggy moved against her. Peggy was snoring again. She always did when she had a cold. </p> <p>The fire was nearly out. The hot ash made a soft glow in the gloom of the cottage.</p> <p>Mother was crooning quietly to the baby. Brid get's eyes were closed and her soft face looked paler than ever as she lay wrapped in Mother's shawl, her little fist clinging to a piece of the long chestnut-colored hair.</p> <p>Bridget was ill&#x2014;they all knew it. Underneath the wrapped shawl her body was too thin, her skin white and either too hot or too cold to the touch. Mother held her all day and all night as if trying to will some of her strength into the little one so loved.</p> <p>Eily could feel tears at the back of her eyes. Sometimes she thought that maybe this was all a dream and soon she would wake up and laugh at it, but the hunger pain in her tummy and the sad ness in her heart were enough to know that it was real. She closed her eyes and remembered.</p> <p>It was hard to believe that it was only a little over a year ago, and they sitting in the old schoolroom, when Tim O'Kelly had run in to get his brother John and told them all to "Make a run home quick to help with lifting the spuds as a pestilence had fallen on the place and they were rotting in the ground." </p> <p>They all waited for the master to get his stick and shout at Tim: Away out of it, you fool, to disturb the learning, but were surprised when he shut his book and told them to make haste and "Mind, no dawdling," and "Away home to give a hand." They all ran so fast that their breath caught in their throats, half afraid of what they would find at home.</p> <p>Eily remembered. Father was sitting on the stone wall, his head in his hands. Mother was kneeling in the field, her hands and apron covered in mud as she pulled the potatoes from the ground, and all around the air heavy with a smell&#x2014;that smell, rot ting, horrible, up your nose, in your mouth. The smell of badness and disease.</p> <p>Across the valley the men cursed and the women prayed to God to save them. Field after field of potatoes had died and rotted in the ground. The crop, their food crop was gone. All the children stared&#x2014;eyes large and frightened, for even they knew that now the hunger would come. </p> <p>Eily snuggled up against Peggy's back and soon felt warmer. She was drowsy and finally drifted back to sleep.</p> <p>"Eily! Eily! Are you getting up?" whispered Peggy.<br> The girls began to stretch and after a while they threw off the blankets. Eily went over to the fire and put a sod of turf on the embers. The basket was nearly empty. That was a job<br> for Michael.</p> <p>Both girls went outside. The early morning sun was shining. The grass was damp with dew. They didn't delay as it was chilly in their shifts. Back in the cottage, Mother was still asleep and little Bridget dozed against her.<br> "Is there something to eat?"<br> "Oh, Michael, easy known you're up," jeered Eily.<br> "Go on, Eily, look, have a look," he pleaded.<br> "Away outside with you and wash that grime off your face and we'll see then."</p> <p>The sunlight peered in through the open cottage door. The place is dusty and dirty, thought Eily.</p> <p>The baby coughed and woke. Eily took her and sat in the fireside chair as Mother busied herself. There were three grayish leftover spuds. Mother sliced them and poured out a drink of skimmed milk from the large jug. It was little enough. No one spoke. They ate in silence, each with their own thoughts.</p> <p>Michael began to talk...to ask for...but changed his mind. Time had taught him a lesson.</p> <p>The first few times he had asked for more, his father or mother had lifted the wooden spoon and brought it down on the palm of his hand. Later, his pleas had been met by a sadness in his father's eyes and his mother bursting into tears. This he could not take on top of the pinches and squeezing of his two sisters. Things were better left unsaid.</p></p><h2>What Technology Wants</h2><p><b>From the author of the<i> New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Inevitable</i><b>&#x2014;&nbsp;</b>a sweeping vision of <b>technology</b>&nbsp;as a living force that can expand our individual<b>&nbsp;potential&nbsp;</b></b><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this provocative book, one of today's most respected thinkers turns the conversation about technology on its head by viewing technology as a natural system, an extension of biological evolution. By mapping the behavior of life, we paradoxically get a glimpse at where technology is headed-or "what it wants." Kevin Kelly offers a dozen trajectories in the coming decades for this near-living system. And as we align ourselves with technology's agenda, we can capture its colossal potential. This visionary and optimistic book explores how technology gives our lives greater meaning and is a must-read for anyone curious about the future.</p></p><p><b>Kevin Kelly</b> is the cofounder of <i>Wired</i> magazine and was its executive editor for its first seven years. He has written for <i>The New York Times, The Economist, Science, Time</i>, and <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. His previous books include the bestselling <i>New Rules for the New Economy</i>.Verbalizing visceral feelings about technology, whether attraction or repulsion, Kelly explores the &#x201c;technium,&#x201d; his term for the globalized, interconnected stage of technological development. Arguing that the processes creating the technium are akin to those of biological evolution, Kelly devotes the opening sections of his exposition to that analogy, maintaining that the technium exhibits a similar tendency toward self-organizing complexity. Having defined the technium, Kelly addresses its discontents, as expressed by the Unabomber (although Kelly admits to trepidation in taking seriously the antitechnology screeds of a murderer) and then as lived by the allegedly technophobic Amish. From his observations and discussions with some Amish people, Kelly extracts some precepts of their attitudes toward gadgets, suggesting folk in the secular world can benefit from the Amish approach of treating tools as servants of self and society rather than as out-of-control masters. Exploring ramifications of technology on human welfare and achievement, Kelly arrives at an optimistic outlook that will interest many, coming, as it does, from the former editor of Wired magazine. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>Vibrant Punch Needle Dï¿½cor: Adorn Your Home with Colorful Florals and Geometric Patterns</h2><p><p>Melissa Lowry, author of <i>Handmade Animal Dolls</i>, shows readers how to embellish their home with the trending quick and easy art of punch needle embroidery.

History lovers and bibliophiles alike will relish poring through 125 letters written by authors, scientists, celebrities, and ordinary people. Like it's 2014 predecessor, each entry includes a replica of the letter in its original form, a transcription (if necessary), and background information to provide context. Highlights include a British professor's cover letter to Albus Dumbledore, requesting to be considered for the position of Defense of the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (and the kind rejection from J.K. Rowling, in character as Professor Dumbledore), a moving letter from Abraham Lincoln to a young girl whose father was killed in the Civil War, and David Bowie's response to his first piece of American fan mail. <b>Relive history with your loved ones with this endlessly entertaining compilation</b>."<br>-Real Simple<br><br>Named one of <b>The 29 Most Stunning Coffee Table Books of The Last Five Years </b> <br>-Refinery29<br><br><b>Starred Review</b>"This follow up to 2014's collection offers newcomers and fans of the series another outstanding compendium of correspondence from celebrities, U.S. presidents, and ordinary citizens. Like its predecessor, each entry includes replicate of the letter in its original form next to a transcription of it content as well as contextual information. The breadth of the collection is impressive all sorts of correspondences, ranging from record producer Steve Albini's 1992 letter to the members of the band Nirvana about their upcoming collaboration on the In Utero album to Abraham Lincoln's 1862 touching letter to a young girl whose father was killed in the Civil War. The letters written by ordinary people are just as noteworthy: an educated slave's farewell letter to his wife after they were separated by after he was sold in 1858 and a soldier's firsthand account of the Christmas truce between British and German troops in 1914 are just some of the heartwrenching inclusions. Happily, there are just as many lighthearted entries as well: there's a University of Sussex professor's cheeky cover letter for the Defence Against the Dark Arts teaching post at Hogwarts, Ayn Rand's 1966 letter to the editor of Cat Fancy magazine, and an illustrated story Beatrix Potter sent to the five-year-old son of her friend and former governess.

Tozer hailed from the Midwest where as a teenager he overheard a street preacher say, &#x201c;If you don't know how to be saved ... just call on God, saying, &#x2018;Lord, be merciful to me a sinner.&#x2019;&#x201d; It was in this moment that he converted to Christianity and began his own pursuit of a more pious life. Of Tozer&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Pursuit of God&#x201d; Samuel M. Zwemer remarks in his introduction that it &#x201c;is the result of long meditation and much prayer. It is not a collection of sermons. It does not deal with the pulpit and the pew but with the soul athirst for God. The chapters could be summarized in Moses&#x2019; prayer, &#x2018;Show me thy glory,&#x2019; or Paul&#x2019;s exclamation, &#x2018;O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!&#x2019; It is theology not of the head but of the heart. ... Here is a book for every pastor, missionary, and devout Christian. It deals with the deep things of God and the riches of His grace. Above all, it has the keynote of sincerity and humility.&#x201d; Arguably Tozer&#x2019;s most popular work &#x201c;The Pursuit of God&#x201d; will be an insightful read for every Christian who ventures down its path in pursuit of God. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper.</p><p>The late Dr. A. W. Tozer was well known in evangelical circles both for his long and fruitful editorship of the Alliance Witness as well as his pastorate of one of the largest Alliance churches in the Chicago area.

In <i>The Berrybender Narratives, </i>now published in a single volume for the first time, the author of <i>Lonesome Dove </i>delivers the unforgettable story of an idiosyncratic pioneer family and a truly unique view of the American West, reminding us again that his writing &#x201c;has the power to clutch the heart and also to exhilarate&#x201d; (<i>The New Yorker</i>). <br><br>In 1830, the Berrybender family&#x2014;British, aristocratic, and fiercely out of place&#x2014;abandons their home in England to embark on a journey through the American West just as the frontier is beginning to open up. Accompanied by a large and varied collection of retainers, Lord and Lady Berrybender intend to travel up the Missouri and settle in Texas, hoping to broaden the perspectives of their children, including Tasmin, a young woman of grit, beauty, and cunning. But when Tasmin&#x2019;s fast-developing relationship with Jim Snow, a frontiersman and ferocious Indian fighter, begins to dictate the family&#x2019;s course, they move further into the expansive and hostile wilderness and into the path of Indians, pioneers, mountain men, and explorers. As Lord Berrybender&#x2019;s health falters, and the rest of the family goes to pieces around him, Tasmin finds herself taking command of their collective fate and is finally forced to decide where her future lies. <br><br>Full of real and fascinating characters, famous shoot-outs, adventure, humor, love, and loss, <i>The Berrybender Narratives </i>is an epic of the American West during its period of transformation, a landscape that nobody understands better than Larry McMurtry.</p><p>Larry McMurtry is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, three memoirs, two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays. He lives in Archer City, Texas.<b> <b>Contents</b> </b> <br> <br>Characters<br> <br>1 A Fish, at Dusk<br> <br>2 A Block of Offspring<br> <br>3 A Doe&#x2019;s Liver, Quickly Eaten<br> <br>4 The Swamp of the Swans<br> <br>5 Rain Spittings and a Slap<br> <br>6 The River Sticks<br> <br>7 A Bad Hand in a Crowd<br> <br>8 Three Wild Chieftains<br> <br>9 Red Nations in Turmoil<br> <br>10 The Captain Heaves a Sigh<br> <br>11 A Squab and a Squash<br> <br>12 Twenty-two Pigeons Raining Down<br> <br>13 Call of the Tundra Swans<br> <br>14 End of a Heavy Eater<br> <br>15 The Only French<br> <br>16 A Funeral in the Morning<br> <br>17 Frailties of Artists<br> <br>18 The Lost Stroke<br> <br>19 The Maid Takes a Swim<br> <br>20 An Eaglet Tamed<br> <br>21 Difficulties with Scissors<br> <br>22 A Modest Bosom, a Buffalo<br> <br>23 Tongue, Liver, Sweetbreads, Haunch, and Saddle<br> <br>24 The Swans Again<br> <br>25 A Hunting Seat Abandoned<br> <br>26 A Cellist Overboard<br> <br>27 A Nip of Grog&#x2014;Two Nips<br> <br>28 A Proposal Considered<br> <br>29 A Hitching Smoothly Accomplished<br> <br>30 The North Star<br> <br>31 A Flinch from Mademoiselle<br> <br>32 A Meadowlark Speaks Out of Turn<br> <br>33 The Doeskin Shirt<br> <br>34 A Cold Night<br> <br>35 A Black-Clad Figure<br> <br>36 A Company of Fiends<br> <br>37 A Master of His Trade<br> <br>38 A Long Mane of Shining Hair<br> <br>39 In the Skull Lodge<br> <br>40 A Question of Sensibility<br> <br>41 Frï¿½ulein Will Not Be Soothed<br> <br>42 A Union Assailed<br> <br>43 Parlous State of the Stores<br> <br>44 An Accidental ï¿½lï¿½vation<br> <br>45 A Stable Boy Flogged<br> <br>46 Sinews for a Bow<br> <br>47 A Burial<br> <br>48 The Trader Is Late<br> <br>49 In a Turmoil of Spirit<br> <br>50 An Old Lord Undeterred<br> <br>51 The World Disappeared<br> <br>52 A Fading Light<br> <br>53 Six Hundred Pounds of Wives<br> <br>54 Rifle and Kit Abandoned<br> <br>55 A Valet Missed<br> <br>56 Frostbite and Its Cure<br> <br>57 A Distressing Litter, Soon Removed<br> <br>58 Wolf Tracks and a Buffalo<br> <br>59 A Grave Not Needed<br> <br>60 Conjugal Occupations<br> <br>61 The Ice Is Unforgiving<br> <br>62 A Dark Woman Visits the Sans Arc<br> <br> <b> <b>Characters</b> </b> <br> <br> <b>Berrybenders</b> <br> <br>Lord Albany Berrybender<br> <br>Lady Constance Berrybender<br> <br>Tasmin<br> <br>Bess (Buffum)<br> <br>Bobbety<br> <br>Mary<br> <br>Brother Seven<br> <br>Sister Ten (<i>later,</i> Kate)<br> <br>Tintamarre, <i>Tasmin&#x2019;s staghound</i><br> <br>Prince Talleyrand, <i>parrot</i><br> <br> <b>Staff</b> <br> <br>Gladwyn, <i>valet, gun bearer</i><br> <br>Frï¿½ulein Pfretzskaner, <i>tutor</i><br> <br>Master Jeremy Thaw, <i>tutor</i><br> <br>Mademoiselle Pellenc, femme de chambre<br> <br>Cook<br> <br>Eliza, <i>kitchen maid</i><br> <br>Millicent, <i>laundress</i><br> <br>Seï¿½or Yanez, <i>gunsmith</i><br> <br>Signor Claricia, <i>carriage maker</i><br> <br>Venetia Kennet, <i>cellist</i><br> <br>Old Gorska, <i>hunter</i><br> <br>Gorska Minor, <i>his son</i><br> <br>Piet Van Wely, <i>naturalist</i><br> <br>Holger Sten, <i>painter</i><br> <br>Tim, <i>stable boy</i><br> <br>Captain George Aitken<br> <br>Charlie Hodges, <i>boatman</i><br> <br>Mery-Michaud, engagï¿½<br> <br>George Catlin, <i>American painter</i><br> <br>Toussaint Charbonneau, <i>interpreter-guide</i><br> <br>Coal, <i>Charbonneau&#x2019;s Hidatsa wife</i><br> <br>Jim Snow (The Raven Brave; Sin Killer)<br> <br>Dan Drew, <i>prairie hunter</i><br> <br>Maelgwyn Evans, <i>trapper, Knife River</i><br> <br>Master Tobias Stiles, <i>deceased</i><br> <br>Father Geoffrin, <i>Jesuit</i><br> <br> <b>Indians</b> <br> <br>Big White, <i>Mandan</i><br> <br>The Hairy Horn, <i>Oglala Sioux</i><br> <br>Blue Thunder, <i>Piegan Blackfoot</i><br> <br>Nemba, <i>Oto</i><br> <br>Pit-ta-sa, <i>Teton Sioux</i><br> <br>Blue Blanket, <i>Teton Sioux</i><br> <br>Neighing Horses, <i>Teton Sioux</i><br> <br>White Hawk, <i>Sans Arc</i><br> <br>Three Geese, <i>Sans Arc</i><br> <br>Grasshopper, <i>Sans Arc</i><br> <br>Cat Head, <i>Sans Arc</i><br> <br>Big Stealer, <i>Sans Arc</i><br> <br>Little Stealer, <i>Sans Arc</i><br> <br>Step Toe, <i>Mandan</i><br> <br>Rabbit Skin, <i>Mandan</i><br> <br>Draga, <i>Aleut-Russian</i><br> <br>The Bad Eye, <i>Gros Ventre</i><br> <br> <b>French</b> <br> <br>Georges Guillaume, <i>trader</i><br> <br>Simon Le Page, <i>Hudson&#x2019;s Bay Company agent</i><br> <br>Malboeuf, <i>his assistant</i><br> <br>John Skraeling, <i>trader</i><br> <br>Malgres, <i>Mexican/Apache</i><br> <br> <b> <b>1</b> </b> <br> <br> In the darkness beyond the great Missouri&#x2019;s shore . . . <br> <br>In the darkness beyond the great Missouri&#x2019;s shore at last lay the West, toward which Tasmin and her family, the numerous Berrybenders, had so long been tending. The Kaw, an unimpressive stream, had been passed that afternoon&#x2014;Tasmin, Bobbety, Bess, and Mary had come ashore in the pirogue to see the prairies that were said to stretch west for a thousand miles; but in fact they could hardly see anything, having arrived just at dusk. The stars were coming out&#x2014;bright, high stars that didn&#x2019;t light the emptiness much, as a full moon might have done. Bess, called Buffum by the family, insisted that she had heard a buffalo cough, while Bobbety claimed to have seen a great fish leap at dusk, some great fish of the Missouri. The three older Berrybenders tramped for a time along the muddy shore, trailed, as usual, by the sinister and uncompromising Mary, aged twelve, whom none of them had invited on the tour. In the last light they all stared at the gray grass and the brown slosh of water; but the great fish of the Missouri did not leap again. Disappointed, the agile Bobbety at once caught a slimy green frog, which he foolishly tried to force down Mary&#x2019;s dress, the predictable result of his actions being that the frog squirmed away while Mary, never one to be trifled with, bit Bobbety&#x2019;s forefinger to the bone, causing him to blubber loudly, to Buffum&#x2019;s great annoyance and Tasmin&#x2019;s quiet contempt. Though Bobbety attempted to give his sister a sharp slap, Mary, like the frog, squirmed away and, for a time, was seen no more.<br> <br>&#x201c;It is said that there are no schools anywhere in the American West, in this year of our Lord 1832,&#x201d; Bess declaimed, in her characteristically pompous way. The three of them were attempting to row the pirogue back to the big boat, but in fact their small craft was solidly grounded on the Missouri mud. Bobbety, muttering about lockjaw and gangrene, dropped the only paddle, which floated away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do get it, Tasmin . . . I&#x2019;m bleeding . . . I fear the piranhas will inevitably attack,&#x201d; Bobbety whined; his knowledge of natural history was of the slightest. Tasmin might readily have given him a succinct lecture on the normally benign nature of the piranha, in any case a fish of the Amazon, not the Missouri, but she decided to postpone the lecture and catch the paddle, a thing soon accomplished, the Missouri being distressingly shallow at that point of its long drainage. Tasmin got wet only to her knees.<br> <br>In her large family, the ancient, multifarious Berrybenders, Tasmin was invariably the one who recovered paddles, righted boats, posted letters, bound up wounds, corrected lessons, dried tears, cuffed the tardy, reproved the wicked, and lectured the ignorant, study having been her passion from her earliest days.<br> <br>Far out in the center of the broad stream, the steamer <i>Rocky Mount</i> seemed to be as immovable as their humble pirogue&#x2014;mired, perhaps, like themselves, in the clinging Missouri mud. Sounds of the evening&#x2019;s carouse were just then wafting across the waves.<br> <br> <b> <b>2</b> </b> <br> <br> Occasionally she caught a note of Haydn . . . <br> <br>No schools at all, how liberating!&#x201d; Bess repeated in her exasperating way; she seemed not to have considered that even if Oxford itself had been transported to the banks of the Kaw, their father, Lord Albany Berrybender, would never have spent a cent to educate any of his girls.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, that is why it has been necessary to bring Frï¿½ulein Pfretzskaner and Master Jeremy Thaw, to tutor you and Bobbety and Mary and, of course, our brother Seven and our sister Ten,&#x201d; Tasmin said.<br> <br>There were, in the Berrybenders&#x2019; great house in Northamptonshire, a block of offspring known collectively as the Ten, all born during a period when Lord Berrybender decided he preferred numbering to naming&#x2014;the latter required a degree of attention he was ever more reluctant to grant, where his offspring were concerned. Only two of the Ten had been allowed to come to America: the boy Seven, possessed of a cleft palate but otherwise physically unobjectionable, and the girl Ten, a wild brat so clever at hiding herself under tables and in closets that she could seldom be easily located&#x2014;not that anyone had reason to seek her with any frequency.<br> <br>Mary Berrybender, born just before the onslaught of the Ten, remained, as she had begun, sui generis, neither one of the older children nor one of the Ten. No less an expert than Piet Van Wely, the Dutch botanist, whose duties, never well defined, required him to deal with whatever flora or fauna the company might encounter, had been the first to remark on the fact that Mary fit no system and conformed to no category, being quite clearly in possession of special powers.<br> <br>&#x201c;She can sniff out roots, edible roots, Jerusalem artichokes, tubers, onions,&#x201d; Piet confided to Tasmin, not long after they left Saint Louis. &#x201c;She has already sniffed out a small edible potato quite unknown to science. Should we find ourselves in a famine the little one can be quite useful, if she cares to be.&#x201d;<br> <br>That, in Tasmin&#x2019;s view, was a considerable &#x201c;if,&#x201d; Mary having so far not evinced even a trace of sentiment for any member of the household, though, to be fair, she was rather fond of Tintamarre, Tasmin&#x2019;s great red staghound, who had bounded off a bit earlier and now came splashing back to the pirogue, where the affectionate beast proceeded to lick Tasmin&#x2019;s face.<br> <br>Frï¿½ulein Pfretzskaner and Master Jeremy Thaw (the tutors), Seï¿½or Yanez (the gunsmith), Signor Claricia (the carriage maker), Holger Sten (the painter, a dank Dane), the aforementioned Piet Van Wely (the botanist), Old Gorska (their hunter, assisted by Gorska Minor, his son), Mademoiselle Pellenc (the <i>femme de chambre</i>), Miss Venetia Kennet (singer, cellist, and, at present, Lord Berrybender&#x2019;s acknowledged mistress), Gladwyn (the Welsh valet, butler, and gun bearer), Tim (the stable boy), and, of course, Cook and her two helpers, Millicent (the laundress) and Eliza (the kitchen girl), comprised only a small part of the eventual Berrybender entourage; it was, though, the part with whom the Berrybenders sailed from Portsmouth to Baltimore, where, after a rather lengthy stay on what had once been Lord Baltimore&#x2019;s plantation, they made their way by wagon and carriage over the deplorably ill-kept roads to Pittsburgh, where they acquired their various boats and set forth down the placid Ohio.<br> <br>At Saint Louis the famous Captain William Clark himself, then commissioner of Indian Affairs, lent them his interpreter, Monsieur Toussaint Charbonneau, a man said to be fluent in the languages of the many native tribes they expected to meet. Captain Clark also helped them secure the services of a dozen or so <i>engagï¿½s,</i> small, smelly Frenchmen from the northlands, who were to help with the boats. But even Captain Clark&#x2019;s vigilance on their behalf could not prevent the last-minute arrival of the painter George Catlin, a balding, finical man of&#x2014;in Tasmin&#x2019;s opinion&#x2014;a decidedly cranky nature; Mr. Catlin leapt aboard just as the steamer, virtually surrounded by the Berrybenders&#x2019; flotilla of pirogues and keelboats, set forth from the village of Saint Charles, a small community but a few miles from the confluence of the Missouri with the Mississippi.<br> <br>Mr. Catlin, who could hardly be called reticent, at once made plain his feeling about the Missouri, the river that was to carry them some two thousand miles into the mysterious reaches of the West.<br> <br>&#x201c;I call it the river Sticks,&#x201d; he said, emitting his characteristic dry, nervous cackle, &#x201c;for as you will soon learn it is filled along much of its length with dead trees, many of them hidden just beneath the surface.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m punning on &#x2018;Styx&#x2019;,&#x201d; he added, assuming, incorrectly, that none of the Berrybenders would know their Homer. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the river the dead must cross to get to Hades . . . and many of us <i>will</i> be dead, unless we&#x2019;re exceptionally lucky.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, do hush about the dead, sir!&#x201d; Lady Constance Berrybender pleaded&#x2014;she had turned quite white beneath her copious rouge. Lady Constance had never been fond of the subject of death. Fortunately her husband, Lord Albany Berrybender, was just sober enough to draw Mr. Catlin off the unwelcome problem of mortality by a timely mention of Mr. John James Audubon, the bird painter, whom the Berrybenders had recently encountered in Baltimore.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why, Lord Berrybender, I&#x2019;ve seen my share of birds and they do <i>not</i> look like that man&#x2019;s birds,&#x201d; Mr. Catlin protested, at once forgetting his bias against the Missouri River. &#x201c;I fear the fellow&#x2019;s altogether a humbug&#x2014;I believe he&#x2019;s a Creole of some kind&#x2014;don&#x2019;t know what the fellow&#x2019;s thinking, drawing birds that don&#x2019;t look at all like the birds <i>I</i> see&#x2014;and I <i>do</i> see birds.&#x201d;<br> <br>John James Audubon, in Tasmin&#x2019;s view, had seemed queerly birdlike himself, a reflection that did not help her much as she caught the floating paddle and returned to the pirogue, in hope of rowing it out to the steamer <i>Rocky Mount.</i> The pirogue was still quite firmly settled into the Missouri mud, though in fact it was no worse off than the steamer, grounded for the night on what the river men called a riffle, or sandbar. Mr. Catlin, though mildly ridiculous, had not been wrong to call the Missouri a plain of mud. The Berrybender family, with all its get and chattels, was, for the moment, stalled.<br> <br>&#x201c;What shall we do, Tasmin?&#x201d; Bobbety asked, as usual referring all questions of procedure to his older sister.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s examine the matter from the point of view of logic,&#x201d; Tasmin said. Her beloved mama and papa&#x2014;Lord and Lady Berrybender, that is to say&#x2014;were, of all the great race of human beings, the least likely to accept the severities of logic. Whim alone was their lodestar and their guide&#x2014;whim it was that caused them to pack up and leave their great house in Northamptonshire; whim had brought them through America to their present resting place on a sandbar in the Missouri River&#x2014;and only so that Lord Berrybender could shoot different animals from those he shot at home.<br> <br>&#x201c;This pirogue won&#x2019;t move, but our legs will,&#x201d; Tasmin pointed out.<br> <br>She was going to suggest that they wade back to the ship and join the evening&#x2019;s carouse when little Mary walked out of the dusk holding an immense, vicious turtle above her head, a creature half at least her own weight, which she promptly flung amidst them, into the pirogue&#x2014;no boat was ever emptied of its human occupants more quickly. Tintamarre, Tasmin&#x2019;s gallant hound, set up a violent braying and attempted a lunge or two at the turtle, of course to little avail. The Berrybenders were in the water, and the turtle was in the boat.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s entirely your fault, Bobbety,&#x201d; Buffum said. &#x201c;Why <i>will</i> boys attempt to thrust frogs down little girls&#x2019; dresses?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bobbety made no reply&#x2014;he was sucking his bitten finger, so that no drop of his noble blood would drip into the Missouri to tempt the piranhas from their watery homes.<br> <br>There seemed nothing for it but to swim back to the steamer, leaving the outraged turtle in possession of the pirogue. The water proved so shallow that no swimming was required, though Mary, perhaps amphibian by nature, dove and bobbed like a dolphin.

What is communism? Where did the idea come from and what attracted people to it? Is there a future for communism? This <em>Very Short Introduction</em> considers these questions and more in the search to explore and understand this controversial political force. Explaining the theory behind its ideology, and examining the history and mindset behind its political, economic and social structures, Leslie Holmes considers the evolution of communism from Marx's time, to its practice in the Bolshevik Revolution, to its collapse in 1989-91. Holmes highlights the inner dynamics, crises, and demise of communism as a global system, and introduces the major players in the communist world, including Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao.<br><br><strong>About the Series</strong>: Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

Glaude Jr. explores the history and circumstances of African American religion through three examples: conjure, African American Christianity, and African American Islam. He argues that the phrase "African American religion" is meaningful only insofar as it describes how through religion, African Americans have responded to oppressive conditions including slavery, Jim Crow apartheid, and the pervasive and institutionalized discrimination that exists today. This bold claim frames his interpretation of the historical record of the wide diversity of religious experiences in the African American community. He rejects the common tendency to racialize African American religious experiences as an inherent proclivity towards religiousness and instead focuses on how religious communities and experiences have developed in the African American community and the context in which these developments took place.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>Oxford's <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible.

(Columbia Themes in Philosophy)</h2><p>Noam Chomsky is widely known and deeply admired for being the founder of modern linguistics, one of the founders of the field of cognitive science, and perhaps the most avidly read political theorist and commentator of our time. In these lectures, he presents a lifetime of philosophical reflection on all three of these areas of research, to which he has contributed for over half a century.<br><br>In clear, precise, and nontechnical language, Chomsky elaborates on fifty years of scientific development in the study of language, sketching how his own work has implications for the origins of language, the close relations that language bears to thought, and its eventual biological basis. He expounds and criticizes many alternative theories, such as those that emphasize the social, the communicative, and the referential aspects of language. Chomsky reviews how new discoveries about language overcome what seemed to be highly problematic assumptions in the past. He also investigates the apparent scope and limits of human cognitive capacities and what the human mind can seriously investigate, in the light of history of science and philosophical reflection and current understanding. Moving from language and mind to society and politics, he concludes with a searching exploration and philosophical defense of a position he describes as "libertarian socialism," tracing its links to anarchism and the ideas of John Dewey and even to the ideas of Marx and Mill, demonstrating its conceptual growth out of our historical past and urgent relation to matters of the present.</p><p>Noam Chomsky is Institute Professor emeritus in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Laureate Professor of Linguistics and Agnese Nelms Haury Chair in the Program in Environment and Social Justice at the University of Arizona. He is the author of more than one hundred books, including <i>The Science of Language</i> (with James McGilvray, 2012) and <i>Requiem for the American Dream</i> (2017).Chomsky's writings invariably reflect the force of intellect and cogency of thought that befits one of the greatest thinkers of our times&#x2015;this work is no exception. (Robert May, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy &amp; Linguistics, University of California, Davis)<br><br>Noam Chomsky is arguably the most influential thinker of our time, having made seminal contributions to linguistics and philosophy, as well as political and social thought. In one succinct and powerfully argued volume, he presents a synthesis of his key ideas. (Howard Gardner, Hobbs Professor of Cognition and Education, Harvard University)<br><br>Noam Chomsky launches this remarkable discussion with the age old question, "What kind of creatures are we?" Thus begins an extended inquiry into human cognition that takes him from the ancients to contemporary theorists of language and science, to politics. Chomsky's erudition is formidable, and I read his disquisition with pleasure and many "aha' moments. But what stands out for me is his wisdom; he accepts that being mere biological creatures, there is much that we can never know, and yet he is deeply empathetic with us, his fellow creatures who must struggle and try to impact our world, even though we ultimately cannot know. (Frances Fox Piven, Distinguished Professor of Political Science, Graduate Center of the City University of New York)<br><br>It's always spring in Mr. Chomsky's garden. Like John Ashbery, Noam Chomsky seems to come up with thoughts that are always fresh, unaffected by the polluting clichï¿½s that most of us inhale and exhale all day and night. To read his sentences is a life-giving elixir. (Wallace Shawn, author, <i>Essays</i>)<br><br>Engaging. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>Recommended.

He was a beloved commander in the field who made the sacrifices necessary to win the war, even in the face of criticism. He worked valiantly to protect the rights of freed men in the South. He allowed the American Indians to shape their own fate even as the realities of Manifest Destiny meant the end of their way of life. In this sweeping and majestic narrative, bestselling author H.W. Brands now reconsiders Grant's legacy and provides an intimate portrait of a heroic man who saved the Union on the battlefield and consolidated that victory as a resolute and principled political leader.</p></p><p><p><b>H. W. Brands</b> is the Dickson Allen Anderson Professor of History at the University of Texas at Austin. A <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author, he was the finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in biography for <i>The First American</i> and again for <i>Traitor to His Class</i>.</p><i>Excerpted from the Hardcover Edition</i><br><br><b>1</b>.<br><br>The journey began generations before he was born. His ancestor Mathew Grant crossed the Atlantic from England with the Puritans in the 1630s, and subsequent Grants migrated progressively west: to Connecticut in the seventeenth century, Pennsylvania in the eighteenth, Ohio in the nineteenth. Jesse Grant, of the sixth generation of American Grants, for a time lived in Deerfield, Ohio, with a family named Brown, of whom a son, John, would attempt to start a slave revolt at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, in 1859.<br><br>Jesse Grant never got much formal education and always felt the lack; he vowed that his sons would not suffer similarly. Jesse married Hannah Simpson in 1821; ten months later, on April 27, 1822, Hannah bore a son they named Hiram Ulysses on the partial inspiration of an aunt with a penchant for the classics. The boy attended private schools, since public education hadn&#x2019;t reached Georgetown, in southwestern Ohio, where he grew up. At fourteen he was sent across the Ohio River to Maysville, Kentucky, to boarding school, but the experience didn&#x2019;t take and he returned to Georgetown. At sixteen he enrolled in an academy in Ripley, on the Ohio bank of the Ohio River, with no greater success. He later acknowledged that the failure was his own fault. &#x201c;I was not studious in habit,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and probably did not make progress enough to compensate for the outlay for board and tuition.&#x201d;<br><br>Yet he was no rebel. &#x201c;He was always a steady, serious sort of boy, who took everything in earnest,&#x201d; his mother recalled. &#x201c;Even when he played he made a business of it.&#x201d; For this reason his parents paid attention when he registered his preferences and dislikes. Jesse owned and operated a tannery, in which Ulys, as family and friends called the boy, was expected to work. But he detested the place and what went on there. &#x201c;He would rather do anything else under the sun than work in the tannery,&#x201d; Jesse recounted. Jesse remembered informing Ulys a few times that he would have to grind bark (for the tannic acid it contained). &#x201c;He would get right up without saying a word and start straight for the village, and get a load to haul, or passengers to carry, or something another to do, and hire a boy to come back and grind the bark.&#x201d; Other aspects of tanning were equally distasteful. In the &#x201c;beam room&#x201d; hides were defleshed by being drawn forcefully over beams; Ulys entered only under paternal duress and told his father that as soon as he could support himself he would never go near the smelly place again. Jesse excused him. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you to work at it now if you don&#x2019;t like it and mean to stick to it,&#x201d; Jesse recalled saying.<br><br>So he let the boy work outdoors. Ulys loved horses and early displayed a gift for riding and managing them. &#x201c;He had the habit of riding our horses to water, standing up on their bare backs,&#x201d; Jesse remembered. &#x201c;He began this practice at about five years old. At eight or nine he would ride them at the top of their speed, he standing upon one foot and balancing himself by the bridle reins.&#x201d; Ulys drove the team that transported wood and other supplies for the tannery; from the age of eleven, when he was big enough to handle a plow, he took charge of all the horse-powered tasks on the family farm.<br><br>He impressed his father with his self-sufficiency, and Jesse let the boy travel by horse and wagon around southwestern Ohio and into Kentucky. The journeys often involved some aspect of the family business: purchasing supplies, delivering messages or finished products. Ulys especially liked to buy horses and felt much older than his years when he made a good bargain.<br><br>Sometimes the bargains weren&#x2019;t so good. A neighbor had a colt that Ulys, then eight, fancied; the neighbor asked twenty-five dollars for it. Jesse didn&#x2019;t want to spend more than twenty, but Ulys pleaded and persuaded his father to let him offer more if necessary. As the story was later told, the boy approached the neighbor: &#x201c;Papa says I may offer you twenty dollars for the colt, but if you won&#x2019;t take that, I am to offer twenty-two and a half, and if you won&#x2019;t take that, to give you twenty-five.&#x201d; The neighbor laughed and received his full price.<br><br>Grant remembered the incident sixty years later, not fondly. &#x201c;This transaction caused me great heart-burning,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The story got out among the boys of the village, and it was a long time before I heard the end of it. Boys enjoy the misery of their companions, at least village boys in that day did, and in later life I have found that all adults are not free from the peculiarity.&#x201d;<br><br>In his eighteenth year Ulysses looked forward to leaving school, but Jesse had other plans. An acquaintance and former friend, Thomas Hamer, represented Georgetown&#x2019;s district in Congress; the friendship had foundered in the breakup of the old Republican party of Thomas Jefferson and the emergence of the Democratic and Whig parties. The Democrats favored Andrew Jackson and opposed the Bank of the United States, while the Whigs backed Henry Clay and supported the national bank. Thomas Hamer was a Jackson man, Jesse Grant a Clay man, and sharp political words led to a personal rupture.<br><br>Yet Jesse needed Hamer&#x2019;s help six years later when he learned that a West Point cadet from the district had to withdraw from the military academy. Jesse wanted Ulysses to receive the nomination in the young man&#x2019;s place. He approached Ohio senator Thomas Morris but was informed that Hamer held the right of appointment. Jesse suspended his hostility toward Hamer long enough to ask him to nominate Ulysses.<br><br>Hamer was willing to move beyond their differences; moreover, with the nomination deadline swiftly approaching, he had no other nominee. He put Ulysses forward.<br><br>Only at this point did Jesse apprise his son of what he had been doing on his behalf. &#x201c;Ulysses, I believe you are going to receive the appointment,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What appointment?&#x201d; Ulysses asked. &#x201c;West Point,&#x201d; Jesse answered.<br><br>Ulysses was less grateful than Jesse thought fitting. The young man didn&#x2019;t know much about the military academy, but what he thought he knew disposed him against it. &#x201c;I had a very exalted idea of the aquirements necessary to get through,&#x201d; he recalled later. &#x201c;I did not believe I possessed them, and could not bear the idea of failing.&#x201d;<br><br>One thing alone, the prospect of a journey, made the appointment appealing. &#x201c;I had always a great desire to travel,&#x201d; he explained. He had ventured as far as a horse could conveniently take him from Georgetown, and the prospect of crossing the eastern mountains was alluring. &#x201c;Going to West Point would give me the opportunity of visiting the two great cities of the continent, Philadelphia and New York.&#x201d; His curiosity overcame his fear and he agreed to go.<br><br>Yet even as he imagined what he would see in the big cities, he secretly hoped fate would spare him from actually becoming a cadet. &#x201c;When these places were visited,&#x201d; he recalled, &#x201c;I would have been glad to have had a steamboat or railroad collision, or any other accident happen, by which I might have received a temporary injury sufficient to make me ineligible, for a time, to enter the Academy.&#x201d;<br><br>The journey was everything he hoped for, save the accident. Steamboats had arrived on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers about the time Grant was born; by 1839 they had transformed the economy of America&#x2019;s central valley, permitting travelers and cargoes to move upriver almost as easily as down. Grant boarded a steamboat at Ripley and rode three days to Pittsburgh. Many travelers on the Ohio in that period remarked the difference in development between the thriving Ohio side of the river, where free farmers tilled the fields and free workers manned the wharves, and the languishing Kentucky and Virginia side, where slaves, with no stake in their labors, did the toiling. If the young Grant noticed the difference, he didn&#x2019;t record it.<br><br>At Pittsburgh he switched to a canal boat. Canals had served the American East since the eighteenth century; during the first third of the nineteenth century they penetrated the interior, with the Erie Canal, completed in 1825, connecting the Hudson River to the Great Lakes and launching New York City to commercial primacy. The narrow-beamed canal boats, pulled by horses or mules on canal-side towpaths, were slow but sure. &#x201c;No mode of conveyance could be more pleasant, when time was not an object,&#x201d; Grant wrote of his own trip. His vessel was comfortable, and the artificial waterway afforded excellent views of the western Pennsylvania landscape. For Grant, the slowness of travel was a mark in the canal&#x2019;s favor. &#x201c;I had rather a dread of reaching my destination.&#x201d;<br><br>At Harrisburg he encountered the revolutionary transport technology of the era. American railroads were younger than Grant, but their effect on locomotion was evident the moment he stepped aboard. &#x201c;We travelled at least eighteen miles an hour, when at full speed,&#x201d; he remembered, &#x201c;and made the whole distance averaging probably as much as twelve miles an hour. This seemed like annihilating space. . . . I thought the perfection of rapid transit had been reached.&#x201d;<br><br>He stepped off the train at Philadelphia, which entranced him so much that he spent five days exploring nearly every street and alley, visiting the sites associated with the landmark events of America&#x2019;s founding, attending the theater and generally acting the young man with pocket money and no desire to leave.<br><br>New York held him less long, in part because he feared he had spent too much money in Philadelphia. But there was also less to see in New York; its urban glory remained prospective. After three days he headed north to West Point and arrived there at the end of May 1839.<br><br>The academy wasn&#x2019;t expecting him, at least not under his given name. Congressman Hamer knew him as Ulysses and assumed this was his first name. For some reason Hamer recorded Grant&#x2019;s middle initial as S, apparently from the family name, Simpson, of Grant&#x2019;s mother. In consequence the academy&#x2019;s registry listed the new cadet as &#x201c;U. S. Grant.&#x201d;<br><br>Grant accepted Ulysses as a first name, having used it as such since he learned to talk. But he clung to Hiram, which he now adopted as a middle name.<br><br>The academy was unmoved. He had been appointed as &#x201c;U. S. Grant,&#x201d; and so he remained in the academy&#x2019;s records. Grant&#x2019;s classmates drew the inevitable connection to &#x201c;Uncle Sam&#x201d; and started calling him &#x201c;Sam Grant.&#x201d; Grant signed his papers &#x201c;Ulysses H. Grant&#x201d; or &#x201c;U. H. Grant&#x201d; until the weight of the army&#x2019;s authority wore him down and he became &#x201c;U. S. Grant&#x201d; in his own hand.<br><br>His introduction to cadet life didn&#x2019;t diminish his ambivalence toward a military education. &#x201c;I slept for two months upon one single pair of blankets,&#x201d; he wrote McKinstry Griffith, a cousin, at the end of the summer&#x2019;s encampment that served as orientation to the academy. &#x201c;I tell you what, coz, it is tremendous hard. Suppose you try it by way of experiment for a night or two.&#x201d; The drilling was tedious and the discipline vexing. The more he reflected on what he had gotten himself into, the deeper his spirits sank. &#x201c;When the 28th of August came--the date for breaking up camp and going into barracks--I felt as though I had been at West Point always,&#x201d; he later recalled, &#x201c;and that if I stayed to graduation, I would have to remain always.&#x201d;<br><br>The autumn scarcely improved his mood. &#x201c;We have tremendous long and hard lessons to get in both French and Algebra,&#x201d; he told his cousin in late September. Though the cadets nominally earned twenty-eight dollars per month, he had yet to see any of it. The rules of daily life could be maddening. &#x201c;If we want anything from a shoestring to a coat, we must go to the commandant of the post and get an order for it.&#x201d; He missed the girls he knew from Ohio. &#x201c;I have been here about four months and have not seen a single familiar face or spoken to a single lady. I wish some of the pretty girls of Bethel were here just so I might look at them.&#x201d;<br><br>The code of conduct was rigid and enforced by a system of black marks. &#x201c;They give a man one of these black marks for almost nothing,&#x201d; Grant explained. &#x201c;If he gets 200 a year they dismiss him.&#x201d; A cadet from New York had received eight black marks for not attending church one Sunday and was confined to his room besides. Grant shook his head. &#x201c;We are not only obliged to go to church but must march there by companies. This is not exactly republican.&#x201d;<br><br>The uniforms struck Grant as ludicrous. &#x201c;If I were to come home now with my uniform on . . . ,&#x201d; he wrote Griffith, &#x201c;you would laugh at my appearance. . . . My pants sit as tight to my skin as the bark to a tree, and if I do not walk military--that is, if I bend over quickly or run--they are very apt to crack with a report as loud as a pistol. My coat must always be buttoned up tight to the chin. . . . It makes me look very singular. If you were to see me at a distance, the first question you would ask would be, &#x2018;Is that a fish or an animal?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Yet there were compensations. The cadets received visits from important officials. Martin Van Buren had followed Andrew Jackson in the White House, and though Van Buren lacked the war record of the hero of New Orleans, he was president, the only one Grant had encountered thus far.<br><br>Winfield Scott was even more impressive. Scott had covered himself with blood and glory in the War of 1812, and unlike Jackson, who had left the military for politics, he had remained in the army. By 1839 he was the ranking American general and the model, in the eyes of Grant and the other cadets, of what a soldier should be. &#x201c;With his commanding figure, his quite colossal size and showy uniform, I thought him the finest specimen of manhood my eyes had ever beheld, and the most to be envied,&#x201d; Grant recalled.<br><br>Visits like Scott&#x2019;s combined with his own adjustment to the ways of the military to make Grant think the academy wasn&#x2019;t so bad after all. &#x201c;There is much to dislike but more to like,&#x201d; he wrote Griffith. &#x201c;On the whole I like the place very much, so much that I would not go away on any account.&#x201d; His teachers emphasized the usefulness of the education he was receiving, and he drew some conclusions of his own. &#x201c;The fact is if a man graduates here he is safe for life, let him go where he will. I mean to study and stay if it be possible. If I cannot--very well, the world is wide.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Snow Walker (On My Own History)</h2><p><p>One morning in March 1888, twelve-year-old Milton Daub awoke to find the world buried in snow. The blizzard was like nothing Milton and his neighbors in the Bronx had ever seen. No one dared go out into the storm. No one, that is, except Milton. He and his father made a pair of snowshoes from barrel hoops and old roller skates. Then Milton stepped bravely into the storm to buy milk for his family. Soon he was buying supplies for everyone in the area. His neighbors declared him a hero. The Blizzard of 1888 set records in the Northeast that are still unbroken. It forced whole cities to shut down for days. But Milton didn't let the snow stop him from helping neighbors in need. His true story is both an exciting adventure and a heartwarming glimpse of old New York.</p></p><p><p>Margaret K Wetterer Is the author of books such as Clyde Tombaugh and The Search For Planet X</p><br><br><p>I truly believe I have the most wonderful job in the world.&nbsp;<br><br>I began drawing at a very early age and I always experienced great joy in being creative. Much of my childhood I spent stretched out on the floor daydreaming and drawing whatever came to my mind.&nbsp;<br><br>A desire to improve my drawing and painting has always been important to me.

I also enjoy hiking, skiing, running, kayaking and bicycling.<br><br>I often visit schools and libraries to talk to children about my work. They get so excited when they try to guess what I am drawing for them. To all the children and adults who enjoy picture books - thank you!</p>Heat up a mug of hot chocolate and throw a log on the fire before listening to this true story from the famous Blizzard of &#39;88. As 12-year-old Milton Daub braves the 1888 snowstorm in the Bronx, the sound of icy, howling winds and cracking trees enhances the experience. The narrator maintains the tension throughout with a tight, slightly hushed reading that seems to slip free from the simplicity of the accompanying easy-reader text. The pacing, slow and resolute as Milton moves determinedly on his mission, rushes forward when the situation becomes dire. The excitement, danger and heroism of Milton&#39;s day of rescue and delivery in the storm will cause young listeners to wish for their own blizzards. T.B.

They follow her life through three failed marriages, numerous affairs, and ultimately a feeling of 'being nobody in myself,' despite years of psychoanalysis and a luxurious lifestyle on two continents among the leading literary, art and intellectual personalities of the day. <i>Winter in Taos</i> unfolds in an entirely different pattern, uncluttered with noteworthy names and ornate details. With no chapters dividing the narrative, Luhan describes her simple life in Taos, New Mexico, this 'new world' she called it, from season to season, following a thread that spools out from her consciousness as if she's recording her thoughts in a journal. 'My pleasure is in being very still and sensing things,' she writes, sharing that pleasure with the reader by describing the joys of adobe rooms warmed in winter by aromatic cedar fires; fragrant in spring with flowers; and scented with homegrown fruits and vegetables being preserved and pickled in summer. Having wandered the world, Luhan found her home at last in Taos. <i>Winter in Taos</i> celebrates the spiritual connection she established with the 'deep living earth' as well as the bonds she forged with Tony Luhan, her 'mountain.' This moving tribute to a land and the people who eked a life from it reminds readers that in northern New Mexico, where the seasons can be harshly beautiful, one can bathe in the sunshine until 'untied are the knots in the heart, for there is nothing like the sun for smoothing out all difficulties.'</p><p>Born in 1879 to a wealthy Buffalo family, Mabel Dodge Luhan earned fame for her friendships with American and European artists, writers and intellectuals and for her influential salons held in her Italian villa and Greenwich Village apartments. In 1917, weary of society and wary of a world steeped in war, she set down roots in remote Taos, New Mexico, then publicized the tiny town&#39;s inspirational beauty to the world, drawing a steady stream of significant guests to her adobe estate, including artist Georgia O&#39;Keeffe, poet Robinson Jeffers, and authors D.H. Lawrence and Willa Cather. Luhan could be difficult, complex and often cruel, yet she was also generous and supportive, establishing a solid reputation as a patron of the arts and as an author of widely read autobiographies. She died in Taos in 1962.</p><h2>Valley of Vengeance: Book Five in The Borrowed World Series</h2><p>In this fifth installment in The Borrowed World Series, Human Resources Manager Alice Watkins is finally making it home.

But death is inevitable, and we must face the question of how to deal with it. Coming to terms with our own finiteness helps us discover life's true meaning. <br> Why do we treat death as a taboo? What are the sources of our fears? How do we express our grief, and how do we accept the death of a person close to us? How can we prepare for our own death? <br> Drawing on our own and other cultures' views of death and dying, Elisabeth Kï¿½bler-Ross provides some illuminating answers to these and other questions. She offers a spectrum of viewpoints, including those of ministers, rabbis, doctors, nurses, and sociologists, and the personal accounts of those near death and of their survivors. <br> Once we come to terms with death as a part of human development, the author shows, death can provide us with a key to the meaning of human existence.</p><p>Elisabeth Kï¿½bler-Ross, MD,&nbsp;[1926&#x2013;2004] was a Swiss-born psychiatrist, humanitarian, and co-founder of the hospice movement around the world.

But whereas birth is cause for celebration, death has become a dreaded and unspeakable issue to be avoided by every means possible in our modern society. Perhaps it is that death reminds us of our human vulnerability in spite of all our technological advances. We may be able to delay it, but we cannot escape it. We, no less than other, nonrational animals, are destined to die at the end of our lives. And death strikes indiscriminately -- it cares not at all for the status or position of the ones it chooses; everyone must die, whether rich or poor, famous or unknown. Even good deeds will not excuse their doers from the sentence of death; the good die as often as the bad. It is perhaps this inevitable and unpredictable quality that makes death so frightening to many people. Especially those who put a high value on being in control of their own existence are offended by the thought that they, too, are subject to the forces of death.</p><p>But other societies have learned to cope better with the reality of death than we seem to have done. It is unlikely that any group has ever welcomed death's intrusion on life, but there are others who have successfully integrated the expectation of death into their understanding of life. Why is it so hard for us to do this? The answer may lie in the question. It is difficult to accept death in this society <i>because</i> it is unfamiliar. In spite of the fact that it happens all the time, we never see it. When a person dies in a hospital, he is quickly whisked away; a magical disappearing act does away with the evidence before it could upset anyone. But, as you will read later in various contexts, being part of the dying process, the death, and the burial, including seeing and perhaps interacting with the body, is an important part of coming to grips with death -- that of the person who has died and your own.</p><p>We routinely shelter children from death and dying, thinking we are protecting them from harm. But it is clear that we do them a disservice by depriving them of the experience. By making death and dying a taboo subject and keeping children away from people who are dying or who have died, we create fear that need not be there. When a person dies, we "help" their loved ones by doing things for them, being cheerful, and fixing up the body so it looks "natural." Again, our "help" is not helpful; it is destructive. When someone dies, it is important that those close to him participate in the process; it will help them in their grief, and it will help them face their own death more easily.</p><p>It <i>is</i> hard to die, and it will always be so, even when we have learned to accept death as an integral part of life, because dying means giving up life on this earth. But if we can learn to view death from a different perspective, to reintroduce it into our lives so that it comes not as a dreaded stranger but as an expected companion to our life, then we can also learn to live our lives with meaning -- with full appreciation of our finiteness, of the limits on our time here. I hope that this book will help you understand death and dying better and will make it a little less hard for you to die and a little easier for you to live.</p><p>Most people in our society die in a hospital. This, in itself, is one of the primary reasons that dying is so hard. The first selection of this chapter explores, from a sociological point of view, the hospital ?as a depersonalizing institution which is not, by definition, set up to meet the human needs of people whose physiological condition is beyond the hospital's capability for successful intervention; these patients represent a failure of the institution in its life-sustaining role, and there is nothing in the system that provides for human nurturance to the soul when the body is beyond repair. The other selection is a moving poem by a young student-nurse who is dying. Having spent time in the hospital as a practitioner and now as a patient, she issues a plea to those who minister to the sick and dying to step away from their professional roles and reach out as human beings to those who need them.</p><p><i>The Organizational Context of Dying</i></p><p>Hans O. Mauksch, Ph.D.</p><p></p><blockquote><i>In our modern technological society, dying is something you do in a hospital. But hospitals art efficient, impersonalized institutions where it is very difficult to live with dignity -- where there is no time and place in the routine to deal with the human needs of sick human beings. In the following selection, Dr. Mauksch explains why it is that hospitals, by definition, are rarely responsive to the special needs of people who are dying. Hospitals are institutions committed to the healing process, and dying patients are a threat to that defined role. The professionals in hospitals have specified expectations and routines to carry out; these simply don't these simply don't work with dying patients. This is a threat to the professionals' roles and creates feelings of inadequacy which are inconsistent with their defines roles as people who can deal effectively with disease. There is no room in the prescribed roles of professionals for them to behave as human beings in response to their dying patients. The history and reasons for the kinds of constraints that exist in the hospital organization are explored by Dr. Mauksch, and he proposes that this need not be so. I think you will find this perspective on the hospital setting (for all people, whether they are dying or not) a very valuable one.</i></blockquote><p>The predominant number of deaths these days occur within the hospital, the institution created by society to support the healing services. Actually, to be historically correct, there was a period in the early phases of the development of this institution when the hospital, indeed, was the institution for people who were either poor and indigent or who were dying. As the science and technology of medicine and of the other health professions have experienced the dramatic growth and development which characterizes the health field in the twentieth century, the whole flavor, aura, culture, and social organization of the hospital has shifted from an institution devoted to charity and to those who die to an institution which is fundamentally committed to healing, to curing, to restoring, and to the recovery process.</p><p>In a differentiated society like our modern, highly complex one, we tend to endow the occupants of social roles and institutions with mandates which denotate their purpose, their function, and their values. The current roles of the health professions have emerged through their own achievements and through the growth of social expectations. In the midst of the current technological emphasis on the success story of healing, the patient whose disease cannot be cured, the human being who is dying is inexorably perceived to be a failure to the health professions -- a failure of the mandate given to the professionals and to the institutions. The organizational context of dying within the hospital must be understood as an institutional response to an event which today is identified as a failure, although it also remains a reminder of the limits of medical knowledge and capabilities.</p><p>A second, more subtle dimension of the organizational context of dying is the different focus required by the needs of the dying patient compared to the needs of the patient whose illness is about to be cured. As a social scientist within the medical setting, I seek to remind physicians and other health professionals that the human being who happens to be ill is indeed an integral part of the disease process and that his or her interactions are crucial to the cure, the care, and the future life of the patient. In the case of the dying patient, the current culture of the hospital, which emphasizes the disease process and the diseased organ, is counterproductive to the needs of the dying patient. Dying is a total experience, and at the point of dying, the diseased organ ceases to be the primary issue.</p><p>There is a third dimension to the climate of dying. In his book <i>Passing On: The Social Organization of Dying,</i> David Sudnow suggests that physicians and nurses, in their behavior and in their attitudes, demonstrate a sense of discomfort and a sense of guilt when facing human beings who, entrusted to their care, terminate their lives in the face of all efforts. Those of us who are committed to recovery, to healing, to cure cannot avoid, within the context of the hospital culture, sensing that we have failed when one of our patients dies. There are several ways in which this sense of guilt, this sense of failure can be understood. It suggests the search for whether everything had been done, whether there were other kinds of resources that could have been invoked, whether all diagnostic and therapeutic means had been employed.</p><p>There is a second way in which one can look at this particular issue. There is a mixture of reality and myth in the belief in the continuous growth and expansion of medical knowledge. I have interviewed a number of physicians who, in the face of the death of a patient, raised the question, "Is there someone else, somewhere, who has new knowledge that could have made the difference?" The sense in which every physician feels responsible for the total state of current medical knowledge apparently varies from physician to physician and hospital setting to hospital setting, but it is an important potential cause for the discomfort of the physician and for possible blocks in the relationship between physician and patient.</p><p>There is the third haunting possibility that I, the physician, or I, the nurse, may have made a mistake, may have committed an error which contributed to the patient's death. Somewhere within the hospital culture lurks the awesome expectation that, while all other human beings are permitted to make mistakes and to commit errors, physician's and nurses must not. Indeed, the facts suggest that these clouds of possible errors have only limit...</p></p><h2>Primeval Saints: Studies in the Patriarchs of Genesis</h2><p>Whenever the heroes from the Bible are trotted out in Sunday school, people are quick to point out their flaws and failings, going straight to the moral of the story rather than paying attention to what the text actually says. In this short but adventurous book, Jordan shows that the Biblical narratives are about so much more than Sunday School lessons and that in fact the patriarchs are not held up for us as examples of failure or sin, but are rather are great moral exemplars.<p></p><p>In contrast to Adam, Cain, and other characters in the early pages of Genesis, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Judah were great heroes of the faith and by paying careful attention to the details of their lives, we can discover much more from the Bible than we often think.</p></p><p>James B. Jordan, Th.M., D. Litt., is author of several books, including <i>Creation in Six Days: A Defense of the Traditional Reading of Genesis One</i> and <i>Through New Eyes: Developing a Biblical View of the World</i>. He is the director of Biblical Horizons Ministries and a fellow at Theopolis, Institute in Birmingham, Alabama.Jacob was a trickster. Abraham lied and questioned God. Joseph was a braggart. These patriarchs of the biblical book of Genesis were certainly flawed, but in Primeval Saints: Studies in the Patriarchs of Genesis, James Jordan argues that they are "saints" nonetheless particularly in comparison to the heroes of pagan literature. Jordan's writing tends toward the didactic, but the thesis is interesting and fresh. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Complete ElfQuest Volume 5</h2><p><b>This fifth volume of the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling series weighs in at a hefty 720 pages.

Sufism is the poetry and mysticism of Islam. This mystical movement from the early ninth century rejects worship motivated by the desire for heavenly reward or the fear of punishment, insisting rather on the love of God as the only valid form of adoration. Sufism has made significant contributions to Islamic civilization in music and philosophy, dance and literature. The Sufi poet Rumi is the bestselling poet in America. But in recent centuries Sufism has been a target for some extremist Islamic movements as well as many modernists. <i>The Garden of Truth</i> presents the beliefs and vision of the mystical heart of Islam, along with a history of Sufi saints and schools of thought. </p> <p> In a world threatened by religious wars, depleting natural resources, a crumbling ecosystem, and alienation and isolation, what has happened to our humanity? Who are we and what are we doing here? The Sufi path offers a journey toward truth, to a knowledge that transcends our mundane concerns, selfish desires, and fears. In Sufism we find a wisdom that brings peace and a relationship with God that nurtures the best in us and in others. </p> <p> Noted scholar Seyyed Hossein Nasr helps you learn the secret wisdom tradition of Islam and enter what the ancient mystics call the "garden of truth." Here, liberate your mind, experience peace, discover your purpose, fall in love with the Divine, and find your true, best self. </p></p><p><p>Seyyed Hossein Nasr is university professor of Islamic Studies at George Washington University. Author of over fifty books, Professor Nasr is a well-known and highly respected intellectual figure both in the West and in the Islamic world. Born in Tehran, raised from the age of twelve in the United States, and a graduate of MIT and Harvard University, Nasr is well qualified to explain Islam to a Western audience. He appears frequently on <em>Meet the Press</em>, as well as other national news shows.</p>Despite the popularity of Sufism, few books provide an overview of this mystical branch of Islam&#x2014; a void Nasr, professor of Islamic Studies at George Washington University, fills nicely, albeit briefly, with this concise primer. Sufism teaches that all aspects of life&#x2014;from nature to other people&#x2014;are signs of God, and yet the grandeur of God is beyond human comprehension. The goal of each Sufi is to take an inner journey to transcend the human state, to illuminate the dark corners of our soul and reconnect with the inner divinity implanted by God at creation. Nasr's book is not a how-to introduction on removing the veils erected by imperfection, which manifest as evil and block our divine roots, but a wise and tantalizing overview. He also includes a detailed and rare history of the Sufi movement and a brief catalogue of the various Sufi orders. Although readers with no prior background in Sufism may struggle with this rather dense intellectual study of the movement, it provides valuable information about the often overlooked philosophical underpinnings of Sufism along with obscure details that will be fascinating to more advanced practitioners. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There is an introduction to making HSTs, all are made larger than needed and trimmed to the correct size. The designs progress from simple rows of HSTs to a quilt resembling a medallion quilt made from 3 different sized HSTs. Scrappy HSTs can even be made by sewing 2" squares and small rectangles of fabric together to form squares. A gallery of 60 blocks shows HSTs in different arrangements. There are black and white grids to photocopy and colour. An original approach to a simple block. * British Patchwork and Quilting * The Half-Square Triangle (HST) is a quilt making staple. Whilst the HST may be a simple block, it yields complex results. A series of 12 patterns start with a beginner friendly, fast and easy design and progress to more challenging designs. The HST is a basic block unit that can be used to make beautiful, timeless quilts. This book shows you the multiple methods for making them (from the slow to the speedy) and combines the HSTs with other pieced blocks that complement the triangle blocks. The final chapter features an inspirational index of over 60 HST block variations and encourages the reader to design their own quilts using a single block design or combining a few. * Sewing World *</p><h2>The Brain Health Book: Using the Power of Neuroscience to Improve Your Life</h2><p><p><strong>Easy-to-understand science-based strategies to maximize your brain&#x2019;s potential.</strong></p><p>Concerns about memory and other thinking skills are common, particularly in middle age and beyond.

With down-to-earth warmth and candor, Graham tells the stories of the events and encounters that helped shape his life. He recounts meetings with presidents, celebrities, and world leaders, including Harry S. Truman, Winston Churchill, Queen Elizabeth, and the Shah of Iran, and shares his own spiritual journey as he movingly reflects on his personal life and relationships. This is an inspirational and unforgettable portrait that will be treasured by readers everywhere. </p></p><p>Every year a Billy Graham crusade comes to a stadium or a television station near you, the message unchangingly passionate, though the messenger is grayer than he once was. The Reverend Billy Graham is more than just another television evangelist; he is as much a part of this country's collective consciousness as F.D.R. or the Vietnam War. Whether you subscribe to Graham's brand of ecumenical evangelism or not, <i>Just As I Am</i> reveals the man behind the crusade to be forthright, deeply religious, and driven to spread the Word at all costs, even his relationships with his family. Graham is characteristically honest about his failings as a husband and father, admitting that he didn't recognize his own children at a family gathering. <p> In <i>Just As I Am</i> Graham discusses the beginnings of his career, his struggle to subsume intellect to faith, and, of course, the many famous--and infamous--people he has met over the years, everyone from the Shah of Iran to the Queen Mother to mobster Mickey Cohen. Graham's ministry has extended his influence to many quarters of the world, a fact that should make his autobiography interesting reading for believers and non-believers alike.</p>The number-one CBA, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today best-seller . . . finally in paperback. In Just As I Am, one of the world&#39;s most beloved and respected leaders tells his inspiring life story in a momentous work of faith and insight. Billy Graham is truly the world&#39;s pastor--the man who has preached to more people than any human being who has ever lived (TIME). His message of faith and fortitude has remained singular and strong. Even more notable is that, unlike many of his counterparts, Graham has maintained a noble reputation of integrity with no trace of scandal. Now, at 78, Graham looks back on an incredible lifetime of personal relationships (including every U.S. president since Eisenhower), whirlwind activity, and influence. In a warm, unassuming voice, he shares the stories of his beginnings in the church, the overwhelming success he has achieved as an evangelist, and the tolls this success took on his family. In Just As I Am, Billy Graham shares how he came from ordinary beginnings to have an extraordinary life of prestige and influence--all derived from his unshakable faith in Christ.</p><h2>Isle of Stars (The Isle Chronicles)</h2><p>The wedding of Griffin &#34;Cat&#34; Thorne and Anne Ross is on!

In fact, Lot 49135 consisted of a nearly complete <i>T. bataar</i>, a close cousin to the most famous animal that ever lived. The fossils now on display in a Manhattan event space had been unearthed in Mongolia, more than 6,000 miles away. At eight-feet high and twenty-four feet long, the specimen was spectacular, and when the gavel sounded, the winning bid was over $1 million.<br><br> Eric Prokopi, a thirty-eight-year-old Floridian, was the man who had brought this extraordinary skeleton to market. A onetime collegiate-level swimmer who spent his teenage years diving for shark teeth, Prokopi's singular obsession with fossils fueled a thriving business hunting, preparing, and selling specimens, to clients ranging from natural history museums to avid private collectors like actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Nicolas Cage. <br><br> But there was a problem. This time, facing financial strain, had Prokopi gone too far? As the <i>T. bataar</i> went to auction, a network of paleontologists alerted the government of Mongolia to the eye-catching lot. An international custody battle ensued, and Prokopi watched his own world unravel.<br><br> In the tradition of <i>The Orchid Thief</i>, <i>The Dinosaur Artist</i> is a stunning work of narrative journalism about humans' relationship with natural history and a seemingly intractable conflict between science and commerce. A story that stretches from Florida's Land O' Lakes to the Gobi Desert, <i>The Dinosaur Artist</i> illuminates the history of fossil collecting--a murky, sometimes risky business, populated by eccentrics and obsessives, where the lines between poacher and hunter, collector and smuggler, enthusiast and opportunist, can easily blur. <br><br> In her first book, Paige Williams has given readers an irresistible story that spans continents, cultures, and millennia as she examines the question of who, ultimately, owns the past.</p><p><b>Paige Williams</b> is a staff writer at <i>The New Yorker </i>and a Mississippi native<i>. </i>A National Magazine Award winner for feature writing, she has had her journalism anthologized in various volumes of the <i>Best American</i> series, including <i>The Best American Magazine Writing </i>and<i> The Best American Crime Writing</i>.

Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--Maison Ikkoku ran from 1980 to 1987, Ranma 1/2 from 1987 to 1996, and Inuyasha from 1996 to 2008. Other notable works include Mermaid Saga, Rumic Theater, and One-Pound Gospel. Takahashi won the Shogakukan Manga Award twice in her career, once for Urusei Yatsura in 1981 and the second time for Inuyasha in 2002. A majority of the Takahashi canon has been adapted into other media such as anime, live-action TV series, and film.</p><h2>Monarch: The Life and Reign of Elizabeth II</h2><p>For more than fifty years, Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor -- who became Elizabeth II, Queen of England on February 6, 1952 -- has been loved and loathed, revered and feared, applauded and criticized by her people. Still she endures as a captivating figure in the world's most durable symbol of political authority: the British monarchy. <br> In <i>Monarch,</i> a meticulously detailed portrait of Elizabeth II as both a human being and an institution, bestselling author Robert Lacey brings the queen to life as never before: as baby "Lilibet" learning to wave to a crowd in the Royal Mews; as a child "ardently praying for a brother" so as to avoid her fate; as a young woman falling in love with and marrying her cousin Philip; and as the mother-in-law of the most complicated royal of all, Princess Diana. <br> Updated with new material to reflect the 2002 Golden Jubilee and the passing of the Queen Mum -- and featuring dozens of photographs, a family tree of the Hanoverian-Windsor-Mountbatten families, and a map that charts the location of royal castles -- <i>Monarch</i> is an engaging, critical, and celebratory account of Elizabeth's half-century reign that no reader of popular history should be without.</p><p><b>Robert Lacey,</b> historian, journalist, and bestselling biographer, has written fifteen previous books, including the national bestsellers <i>Majesty; Ford: The Men and the Machine; The Kingdom: Arabia and the House of Sa'ud;</i> and most recently <i>The Year 1000.</i> He lives in London.<b>Prologue</b> <p> <b>"As your Queen, and as a grandmother"</b></p> <p> It was on a cool September Thursday at Balmoral that Queen Elizabeth II realised she would have to change course. She had read the newspapers over breakfast that morning, digesting their angry sermons with the long-practised pensiveness which caused her eyes to narrow. Her jaw would firm slightly as her thought processes started, shifting her chin forward a fraction -- a signal to her staff to think one more hard thought before they opened their mouths. Then, soon after nine o'clock, the phone calls from London started. </p><p> Diana had died the previous Sunday -- the last day of August 1997 -- and it had been pressure and decisions ever since. Helping the two boys had been their grandmother's first priority, applying her own therapy in times of trouble -- lots of exercise and fresh air. </p><p> "We must get them out and away from the television," said the queen as she clicked across the mournful images of the princess being run non-stop on every channel. "Let's get them both up in the hills." </p><p> The fact that they were all together as a family, away from everything, in the rugged beauty and peace of Scotland, had seemed such a blessing at first. Peter Phillips, Princess Anne's bluff and burly rugby-playing son, had gone out with William and Harry on the moors each day, jollying them along with stalking and the odd fishing expedition -- plus lots of mucking around on the brothers' noisy all-terrain motorbikes. The two young princes both loved the outdoors. In that respect they were very much Charles's sons. </p><p> The weather had been balmy, with just a hint of autumn crispness, and the whole family had driven out most evenings in the Land Rovers to eat. Ever practical, ever-tinkering, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, is the proud deviser of a bulky, wheeled contraption that is the centre of these cherished rituals -- a picnic trailer. With the grilling rack and pots and pans stowed neat and ship-shape enough for the naval officer he had been, and padded drawers for carefully segregated types of fortifying alcohol, the wagon is towed to the shooting lodge selected for the family barbecue. No staff are present and the royal paterfamilias becomes chef. </p><p> In that first week of September, the duke's barbecue wagon had come into its own as never before. Cooking and carving and cleaning up afterwards, the shared chores and rituals of the self-help meal had kept the whole family busy and had helped create the feeling there was something everyone could do. It was practical therapy. </p><p> At fifteen, William had seemed to take it bravely, on the outside at least. But he was insisting that he would not walk behind the coffin at the funeral. Not quite thirteen, Harry had been more obviously upset. Was everyone quite sure Mummy was dead? he was heard to enquire. Could it not be checked to make sure there had not been a mistake? </p><p> Gently helping the brothers to cope was, like everything royal, more than just a private, family matter. If the two young princes did walk through the streets in London on Saturday, their composure would be the pivot on which the whole occasion turned. </p><p> Working out the details of the funeral had been the other big job since Sunday -- the style of the service, the length of the route, as well as the role that William and Harry would play. There had been family arguments in the small hours as the bad news came through. The Spencers -- Diana's mother, brother, and two sisters -- had wanted a private funeral, a small family affair, and to start with the queen herself had agreed. But by Sunday evening it was clear it would have to be a full-scale ceremony in Westminster Abbey, and since Monday the fax machine had been processing hymn sheets and processional time-tabling non-stop. Princess Margaret disapproved, but the queen mother had got quite excited about the prospect of listening to Elton John. </p><p> Then came all the fuss about the flag. </p><p> Downing Street was the first to sense that something was awry. Sitting in his media command room at No. 10, Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's press spokesman, caught a cable television news bulletin that worried him. It was Wednesday morning, and the long lines of mourners waiting in the Mall to sign the condolence books for the princess were spending as many as five hours looking through the trees towards Buckingham Palace. </p><p> People were not just signing their names when they got to the head of the queue. Most wanted to pen some special tribute of their own, and after half a day on their feet everyone wanted to sit down. </p><p> "In retrospect," says an official of the Lord Chamberlain's Office, "it was clearly a mistake to have supplied chairs." </p><p> Some people were spending as much as half an hour over the page composing their essays. So the lines waiting outside in the Mall grew longer, and as people shuffled slowly forward, they had been struck by the absence of any flag flying at half-mast over the queen's principal residence. </p><p> It was a technical matter. The queen's presence is signalled wherever she may be -- in palace, car, boat, or plane -- by the Royal Standard, a luscious and ancient confection of heraldic lions and symbolic harpstrings that follows her everywhere, battle-standard-style, and is never lowered, even when the sovereign dies. "The King is Dead, Long Live the King." </p><p> But the tradition had developed at Buckingham Palace -- though not at any other royal residence -- that, in the absence of the Royal Standard, no other flag should fly. So while flags all round the country -- including those over Windsor Castle and over the royal country residence of Sandringham in East Anglia -- were now flying at half-mast, Buckingham Palace itself was conspicuously bare of any sign of mourning for Diana. </p><p> "I've just been watching Sky News," said Campbell in a phone call to Robert Fellowes, the queen's private secretary, who was also Diana's brother-in-law, married to her elder sister, Jane. "Now, it's just a straw in the wind, but I think they're going to make some mischief over this thing of the flag." </p><p> Rupert Murdoch's Sky News had been running dramatic vox pop interviews from the Mall in which mourners complained about the bare flagpole over the palace. It made for compulsive, angry television, and Campbell guessed it was only a matter of time before the other bulletins followed suit. </p><p> "I hear what you're saying," replied Fellowes. "But it's a curious business, the flag at Buckingham Palace. There are certain things, you know, that I can deliver straight away. But I'm not sure it's going to be as easy as it looks, even if it's right, to please the public on this one." </p><p> Fellowes rang Balmoral to pass on Downing Street's concerns to his deputy Sir Robin Janvrin, who was running the private secretary's office there, and also to the queen. But the private secretary did not argue Campbell's case very strongly. </p><p> "The alarm bells," as one participant put it, "did not jangle." </p><p> Sir Robert Fellowes, today Baron Fellowes of Shotesham in the county of Norfolk, was a royal retainer who was the son of a royal retainer. His father, the bluff Sir Billy Fellowes, had run the royal estate at Sandringham and had been a shooting companion of the queen's father, King George VI. In his time as private secretary, Fellowes had overseen some important changes in the monarchy, and there was a mildly subversive twinkle behind his horn-rimmed spectacles. </p><p> "We don't have protocol here," he liked to say when talking of palace etiquette " -- just bloody good manners." </p><p> But Fellowes had breathed tradition all his life. It was a key element in his job as private secretary, and protocol had always provided a sure fall-back in times of difficulty. </p><p> Elizabeth II felt the same only more so. For the queen, tradition and protocol represented something greater than oneself -- deep values approaching the sacred. It could be compared to how non-royal people feel at their children's Christmas carol concert or when the bugle sounds on Remembrance Day -- the tingle of nobler things. It is easy to smile condescendingly at the scarlet-tunicked and bearskin-clad Guards parading formally outside Buckingham Palace until, in the aftermath of a terrorist attack on New York, these very British soldiers stand to attention while their band plays "The Star Spangled Banner." </p><p> Tradition is one of the cornerstones of the royal mystery. The most troublesome time in the otherwise tranquil childhood of the young Princess Elizabeth had been when she was just ten, when her sparky and original Uncle David had ascended to the throne as Edward VIII. Shrugging his shoulders at precedent, he had spent a hectic year insouciantly overturning tradition in his quest to make the monarchy modern, and it had ended in tears. The abdication crisis of 1936 was the darkest moment in her family's recent history. </p><p> If Prince Charles, and not his ex-wife, had died in a car crash the previous Sunday, the queen would not now be flying the Union Jack at half-mast over Buckingham Palace. She had not done it for her beloved father, George VI -- and it would not happen for the queen mother, who, despite all her personal popularity, had always understood how the institution of monarchy ultimately transcended the individual. </p><p> A personally modest spirit, the queen would certainly not expect such a gesture for herself. So why should tradition be overturned for a young woman who, Uncle David-like, had put herself before the family and had come to be the focus of such bitter and divisive trouble? </p><p> Elizabeth II had been one of the first in the family to fall out of love with Diana. </p><p> "The Queen is a very good judge of character," says one of her staff. "She was very quick in 'sussing' the less fortunate sides of the princess's personality." </p><p> The queen had tried to be fair to her daughter-in-law, taking her side on occasions in the bitter separation battle with Charles. But Diana's open sniping at what she had publicly derided as the stuffy palace establishment made her the last person for whom the queen -- or still less ...</p></p><h2>Faces of the Moon</h2><p><b>Do you wonder, when you see the Moon,<br>at dusk, or dawn, or midday noon,<br>just why her face is curved, or round,<br>or why she sometimes can&#x2019;t be found?</b><br><br>Why does the Moon seem to change shape from night to night?

Some slaves devised creative and subversive means to acquire literacy, and when slavery ended, they became the first teachers of other freedpeople. Soon overwhelmed by the demands for education, they called on northern missionaries to come to their aid. Williams argues that by teaching, building schools, supporting teachers, resisting violence, and claiming education as a civil right, African Americans transformed the face of education in the South to the great benefit of both black and white southerners. <br><br><br><br></p><p>"Groundbreaking. . .

No one could have predicted that this small masterpiece would be the result. First published in 1959 and out of print for more than three decades, their fourth book about Eloise is <b>DELICIOUS.</b></p><p>Eloise gets more outlandish with each book in Kay Thompson and Hilary Knight's popular 1950s series. First published in 1951--when cold war sentiments were heating up--<i>Eloise in Moscow</i> showcases the highly undiplomatic exploits of our favorite precocious 6-year-old as she paints the town red with her beloved Nanny. Adults will relish this glimpse behind the Iron Curtain, complete with a foldout spread of the Kremlin that is positively suitable for framing ("Here's what they/ have in the Kremlin/ armor Easter eggs/ icons/ and clocks," "Ivan is terrible/ and is watching in this tower"). The usual pink, black, and white color scheme is absent here--Knight's pen-and-ink drawings are instead accented with a rich goldenrod, and in the foldout Kremlin, even oranges and greens. <p> After a three-week stay in Moscow with her colleague Hilary Knight, Kay Thompson had plenty of fodder for her distinctly Eloisian travelogue: the food ("It is difficult to know what to eat in Moscow/ There is no melon in season/ Nichevo"); the stilted English of their tour guide ("That house is Chekhov/ That house is Stanislavsky if you want to see it/ No you cannot it is reconstruction"); national security ("Our telephone had quite a bit of static/ so we talked about General de Gaulle/ to throw them off track/ Everybody listens to everything in Moscow"); and even the water ("The water is Russian so I brushed my teeth/ with/ pear lemonade and apple lemonade/ Actually I preferred/ the pear").</p><p> Children will be fascinated by the intricate, delicately skritched details of this 72-page picture book, but adults will surely be the most amused. Fortunately, in the wake of Eloise's Russian junket, the Kremlin wall is left standing, and there are no international repercussions. But is she, as she haughtily declares, an "absolutely darling little sweetnik"? Definitely <i>nyet</i>. And that's the way we like her. If your Eloise library is incomplete, which would be sad, be sure to investigate <i>Eloise in Paris</i>; <i>Eloise at Christmastime</i>; <i>The Absolutely Essential Eloise</i> (complete with historical scrapbook); or the original recipe, <i>Eloise</i>. (Best for grownups--or as a read-aloud for ages 7 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Kay Thompson (1909&#x2013;1998) was a singer, dancer, vocal arranger, and coach of many MGM musicals in the 1940s. The Eloise character grew out of the voice of a precocious six-year-old that Miss Thompson put on to amuse her friends. Collaborating with Hilary Knight on what was an immediate bestseller, Kay Thompson became a literary sensation when <i>Eloise</i> was published in 1955. The book has sold more than two million copies to date. Kay Thompson and Hilary Knight created four more Eloise books, <i>Eloise in Paris, Eloise at Christmas, Eloise in Moscow,</i> and <i>Eloise Takes a Bawth.</i><br><br>Hilary Knight, son of artist-writers Clayton Knight and Katharine Sturges, was educated at the Art Students League, where he studied with Reginald Marsh.

He lives in California with his wife.<i>Chapter One<br><br> Territorial Imperative</i><br> The man most deserving of credit for keeping the MacArthur Park killing out of the newspapers before it brought discredit to the Los Angeles Police Department was Commander Hector Moss. It was perhaps Commander Moss' finest hour.<br><br> The blond commander was so exultant this afternoon he didn't mind that Deputy Chief Adrian Lynch was keeping him waiting the allotted time. Chief Lynch kept all callers waiting precisely three minutes before coming to the phone, unless his secretary told him it was an assistant chief or the chief of police himself or one of the commissioners or a city councilman or anyone at City Hall who reported directly to the mayor.<br><br> Moss despised Lynch for having a do-nothing job and a specially ordered oversized desk. Moss knew for a fact that Deputy Chief Lynch had secret plans to increase his personal staff by two: one policewoman and one civilian, both of whom were busty young women. Commander Moss knew this because his adjutant, Lieutenant Dewey Treadwell, had sneaked into Lynch's office and searched his file basket when a janitor left the door open. Of course Lieutenant Treadwell could not receive a specifically worded commendation for his assignment but he did receive an ambiguously worded "attaboy" from Moss.<br><br> But there was another assignment which Treadwell had failed to carry out, and Commander Moss' stomach soured as he remembered it. It had to do with Moss' IQ score of 107. Throughout his twenty-one year career his IQ had meant nothing to his rise to the rank of commander. Indeed, he had not even known what his score was. He had been a state college honors student in police science and reasoned that no one with an ordinary IQ could manage this. But with the retirement of a senior deputy chief it had been called to Moss' attention by none other than Deputy Chief Lynch who didn't think the promotion board would consider a man for such a high police post who possessed an IQ of only 107. Lynch's own IQ was 140.<br><br> Commander Moss was livid. He took Lieutenant Treadwell to a Chinatown bar one Friday after work and forced the teetotaler to down five cocktails, promising his personal patronage for the rest of Treadwell's career if he could carry off a most delicate assignment. The ever ambitious, thirty year old lieutenant agreed to slip into Personnel Division that night and change Commander Moss' IQ score from 107 to 141.<br><br> Commander Moss downed his fourth Singapore sling and said, "Treadwell, I know I can depend on you."<br><br> But instantly the lieutenant's ambition gave way to fear. He stammered, "If anything ever . . . well, look, sir, the watch commander of Personnel is a former detective. He might start sniffing around. They have ways in the crime lab to tell if documents have been tampered with!"<br><br> "Don't talk crime lab to me, Treadwell," Moss replied. "Have you ever worked the Detective Bureau?"<br><br> "No, sir."<br><br> "You listen to me, Treadwell. You're an office pogue. You never been anything but an office pogue. You don't have the slightest idea what goes on in a working police division. But you keep your mouth shut and do what you're told and I'll see to it that you're a captain someday and you can have your own station to play with. You don't and I'll have you in uniform on the nightwatch in Watts. Understand me, Treadwell?"<br><br> "Oh, yes, sir!"<br><br> "Now drink your Pink Lady," Commander Moss commanded. (It was Hector Moss who had persuaded the chief of police that the traditional police rank of "inspector" was no longer viable in an era of violence when policemen are called upon to employ counterinsurgency tactics. Thanks to Moss all officers formerly of the inspector rank could now call themselves "commander." Moss had "Commander and Mrs. Hector Moss" painted on his home mailbox. Commander Moss had been a PFC in the army.)<br><br> Lieutenant Treadwell tried desperately every night for three weeks to sneak into Personnel Division. Each morning he reported a "Sorry, sir, negative" to Commander Moss. Lieutenant Dewey Treadwell lost ten pounds in those three weeks. He slept no more than four hours a night and then only fitfully. He was impotent. On the twenty-first night of his mission he was almost caught by a janitor. Lieutenant Treadwell was defeated and admitted it to Commander Moss on a black Wednesday morning.<br><br> The commander listened to his adjutant's excuses for a moment and said, "Did you get a good look at the janitor's face, Lieutenant?"<br><br> "Yes, sir. No . . . I don't know, sir. Why?"<br><br> "Because that boogie might live in Watts. And you'll need some friends there. because that's where i'm sending you on the next transfer, you incompetent fucking pansy!"<br><br> Commander Moss did not send Lieutenant Treadwell to Watts. He decided a spineless jellyfish was preferable to a smart aleck like Lieutenant Wirtz who worked for Deputy Chief Lynch. What he did was to go into Personnel Division in broad daylight, rip the commendation he wrote for Treadwell out of the file, draw a black X through it with a felt tipped pen, seal it in an envelope and leave it in Lieutenant Treadwell's incoming basket without comment.<br><br> Lieutenant Treadwell, after his hair started falling out in tufts, earned his way back into Commander Moss' good graces by authoring that portion of the Los Angeles Police Department manual which reads:<br><br> sideburns: Sideburns shall not extend below the bottom of the outer ear opening (the top of the earlobe) and shall end in a clean-shaven horizontal line. The flare (terminal portion of the sideburn) shall not exceed the width of the main portion of the sideburn by more than one-fourth of the unflared width.<br><br> moustaches: A short and neatly trimmed moustache of natural color may be worn. Moustaches shall not extend below the vermilion border of the upper lip or the corners of the mouth and may not extend to the side more than one-quarter inch beyond the corners of the mouth.<br><br> It took Lieutenant Treadwell thirteen weeks to compose the regulations. He was toasted and congratulated at a staff meeting. He beamed proudly. The regulations were perfect. No one could understand them.<br><br> As Commander Moss cooled his heels on the telephone waiting for Deputy Chief Adrian Lynch, the deputy chief was watching the second hand on his watch sweep past the normal three minute interval he reserved for most callers. Chief Lynch couldn't decide whether to give Moss a four minute wait or have his secretary say he would call back. Of course he couldn't be obviously rude. That bastard Moss had the ear of the chief of police and every other idiot who didn't know him well. Lynch hated those phony golden locks which Moss probably tinted. The asshole was at least forty-five years old and still looked like a Boy Scout. Not a wrinkle on that smirking kisser.<br><br> Lynch punched the phone button viciously and chirped, "Good morning, Deputy Chief Lynch speaking. <br><br> May I help you?"<br><br> "It's I, Chief. Hec Moss," said the commander, and Chief Lynch grimaced and thought, It's I. Oh shit!<br><br> "Yeah Hec."<br><br> "Chief, it's about the MacArthur Park orgy."<br><br> "Goddamnit, don't call it that!"<br><br> "Sorry sir. I meant the choir practice."<br><br> "Don't call it that either. That's all we need for the papers to pick it up."<br><br> "Yes sir," Moss said. And then more slyly, "I'm very cognizant of bad press, sir. After all, I squelched the thing and assuaged the victim's family."<br><br> Oh shit! thought Lynch. Assuaged. "Yes, Hec," said the chief wearily."Well sir, I was wondering, just to lock the thing up so to speak, I was wondering if we shouldn't have the chief order quick trial boards for every officer who was at the orgy. Fire them all."<br><br> "Don't . . . say . . . orgy. And don't . . . say . . . choir practice!"<br><br> "Sorry sir."<br><br> "That's not very good thinking, Hec." The chief tilted back in his chair, lifted his wing tips to the desk top, raised up his rust colored hairpiece and scratched his freckled rubbery scalp. "I don't think we should consider firing them."<br><br> "They deserve it, sir."<br><br> "They deserve more than that, Hec. The bastards deserve to be in jail as accessories to a killing. I'd personally like to see every one of them in Folsom Prison. But they might make a fuss. They might bring in some lawyers to the trial board. They might notify the press if we have a mass dismissal. In short, they might hurl a pail of defecation into the air conditioning."<br><br> Chief Lynch waited for a chuckle from Moss, got none and thought again about Moss' low IQ. "Anyway, Hec," he continued, "we have a real good case only against the one who did the shooting and I think we're stuck with that. We'll give the others a trial board and a six month suspension, but we'll take care of it quietly. Maybe we can scare some of them into resigning."<br><br> "Some goddamn shrink at General Hospital's saying that killer's nuts."<br><br> "What do you expect from General Hospital? What're they good for anyway but treating the lame and lazy on the welfare rolls? What do you plan to do about that dumbass detective who examined the officer the night of the shooting and ordered him taken to the psychiatric ward?"<br><br> "Ten days off?"<br><br> "Should get twenty."<br><br> "Afraid he might complain to the press."<br><br> "Guess you're right," Chief Lynch conceded grudgingly."Well, hope you're happy with our office, Chief!"<br><br> "You did a fine job, Hec," Deputy Chief Lynch said. "But I wish you'd talk to your secretary.

In the spring of 1966, the war was still popular and the draftees of Charlie Company saw their service as a rite of passage. But by December 1967, when the company rotated home, only 30 men were not casualties-and they were among the first vets of the war to be spit on and harassed by war protestors as they arrived back the U.S.</p><p>In his new book, The Boys of '67, Andy Wiest, the award-winning author of Vietnam's Forgotten Army and The Vietnam War 1956-1975, examines the experiences of a company from the only division in the Vietnam era to train and deploy together in similar fashion to WWII's famous 101st Airborne Division.</p><p>Wiest interviewed more than 50 officers and enlisted men who served with Charlie Company, including the surviving platoon leaders and both of the company's commanders. (One of the platoon leaders, Lt Jack Benedick, lost both of his legs, but went on to become a champion skier.) In addition, he interviewed 15 family members of Charlie Company veterans, including wives, children, parents, and siblings. Wiest also had access to personal papers, collections of letters, a diary, an abundance of newspaper clippings, training notebooks, field manuals, condolence letters, and photographs from before, during, and after the conflict.</p><p>As Wiest shows, the fighting that Charlie Company saw in 1967 was nearly as bloody as many of the better publicized battles, including the infamous 'Ia Drang' and 'Hamburger Hill.' As a result, many of the surviving members of Charlie Company came home with what the military now recognizes as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder-a diagnosis that was not recognized until the late 1970s and was not widely treated until the 1980s. Only recently, after more than 40 years, have many members of Charlie Company achieved any real and sustained relief from their suffering.</p></p><p>Andrew Wiest, Ph.D.&nbsp;is Professor of History at the University of Southern Mississippi.&nbsp; Also the founding director of the Center for the Study of War and Society, Wiest was born in Chicago, but raised in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.&nbsp; After attending the University of Southern Mississippi for his undergraduate and Master's degrees, Dr. Wiest went on to receive his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois, Chicago in 1990.&nbsp; Specializing in the study of World War I and Vietnam, Dr. Wiest has served as a Visiting Senior Lecturer at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst in the United Kingdom and as a Visiting Professor in the Department of Warfighting Strategy in the United States Air Force Air War College.&nbsp; Since 1992 Dr. Wiest has been active in international education, leading a study abroad program on World War II to London and Normandy each summer, and developing the award-winning Vietnam Study Abroad Program.&nbsp; Dr. Wiest has published 14 books on various topics in the field of Military History, including Vietnam's Forgotten Army: Heroism and Betrayal in the ARVN (New York University Press), which won the Society for Military History's Distinguished Book Award; America and the Vietnam War (Routledge Press); Rolling Thunder in a Gentle Land (Osprey Press); and Passchendaele and the Royal Navy (Greenwood Press).&nbsp; Additionally Dr. Wiest has appeared in and consulted on several historical documentaries for the History Channel, Granada Television, PBS, the BBC, and for Lucasfilm.&nbsp; Dr. Wiest lives in Hattiesburg with his wife Jill and their three children Abigail, Luke and Wyatt.<p>&#x201c;Wiest's use of personal interviews and letters home put a personal touch on the book. I felt a growing sense of attachment to the men of Charlie Company as the book progressed, felt a sense of their heartache when their brothers died, and I sympathized for many of them who struggled with PTSD following the war. Wiest addresses the ugliness and humanity of war, but also the loving bonds that are created between men who experience war together and the indelible marks it leaves on their minds.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Abigail Pfeiffer,&nbsp;Armchair General</i></p><p>&#x201c;The Boys of 67 is an exceptionally well researched and well told story of an exceptional US Army infantry company in Vietnam.

Cohen Book on American&#x2013;East Asian Relations)</h2><p>Soon after the American Revolution, certain of the founders began to recognize the strategic significance of Asia and the Pacific and the vast material and cultural resources at stake there. Over the coming generations, the United States continued to ask how best to expand trade with the region and whether to partner with China, at the center of the continent, or Japan, looking toward the Pacific. Where should the United States draw its defensive line, and how should it export democratic principles? In a history that spans the eighteenth century to the present, Michael J. Green follows the development of U.S. strategic thinking toward East Asia, identifying recurring themes in American statecraft that reflect the nation's political philosophy and material realities.<br><br>Drawing on archives, interviews, and his own experience in the Pentagon and White House, Green finds one overarching concern driving U.S. policy toward East Asia: a fear that a rival power might use the Pacific to isolate and threaten the United States and prevent the ocean from becoming a conduit for the westward free flow of trade, values, and forward defense. <i>By More Than Providence</i> works through these problems from the perspective of history's major strategists and statesmen, from Thomas Jefferson to Alfred Thayer Mahan and Henry Kissinger. It records the fate of their ideas as they collided with the realities of the Far East and adds clarity to America's stakes in the region, especially when compared with those of Europe and the Middle East.</p><p>Michael J. Green is senior vice president for Asia and Japan chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and director of Asian studies at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. He served on the staff of the National Security Council from 2001 through 2005.Michael Green's magisterial study is a timely and insightful reminder of the deep and long-standing ties between East Asia and the United States, and the complex interplay between our economic and security interests, and our values, a dynamic which has shaped US policy for two and a half centuries. It is an indispensable point of reference for students and policy makers seeking to understand a critical region where history casts a long shadow, notwithstanding the extraordinary changes of recent years.

As you get older, you naturally grow apart from other people.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t need other people to complete you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t have so many problems if you would just stand on your own two feet.&#x201d;</p><p>The message is clear: it&#x2019;s not &#x201c;healthy&#x201d; to need other people&#x2014;and whatever you do, don&#x2019;t let yourself be infected by other peoples&#x2019; feelings, thoughts, and emotions. The statements above are intended to have an emotional effect on you. You may notice that they sound just a <i>teensy </i>bit judgmental and shaming. I know they make me uncomfortable; when I read them, I feel like I&#x2019;m standing in a harsh white spotlight with someone pointing a finger at me, intoning <i>You&#x2019;re pretty messed up, missy, and it&#x2019;s all your fault.</i></p><p>The ideal of complete psychological independence is one that was very big with mental health professionals in much of the twentieth century, and it still has our culture by the throat. So even if those statements about boundaries carry a sting, they also probably sound familiar to you, or even self-evident. Obvious!</p><p>So I couldn&#x2019;t possibly be suggesting that they&#x2019;re untrue. I couldn&#x2019;t possibly say that it can be good to be dependent, or that our mental health is unavoidably affected by the people we share our lives with, or that we achieve emotional growth when we are profoundly connected to others instead of when we are apart from them.</p><p>That&#x2019;s exactly what I&#x2019;m saying.</p><p>This book is going to show you a different way of thinking about your emotional needs and what it means to be a healthy, mature adult. A new field of scientific study, one I call <i>relational</i> <i>neuroscience</i>, has shown us that there is hardwiring throughout our brains and bodies designed to help us engage in satisfying emotional connection with others. This hardwiring includes four primary neural pathways that are featured in this book. Relational neuroscience has also shown that when we are cut off from others, these neural pathways suffer. The result is a neurological cascade that can result in chronic irritability and anger, depression, addiction, and chronic physical illness. We are just not as healthy when we try to stand on our own, and that&#x2019;s because the human brain is built to operate within a network of caring human relationships. How do we reach our personal and professional potential? By being warmly, safely connected to partners, friends, coworkers, and family. Only then do our neural pathways get the stimulation they need to make our brains calmer, more tolerant, more resonant, and more productive.</p><p>The good news for those of us whose relationships don&#x2019;t always feel so warm or safe: it is possible to heal and strengthen those four neural pathways that are weakened when you don&#x2019;t have strong connections. Relationships and your brain form a virtuous circle, so by strengthening your neural pathways for connection, you will also make it easier to build the healthy relationships that are essential for your psychological and physical health.</p><p>For many people, the news about the importance of relationships began with a 1998 study at the University of Parma in Italy, a study that proved how deeply connected we are to one another, right down to our neurons.</p><p>Your Feelings, My Brain</p><p>It was one of those lucky scientific mistakes, an unexpected observation that could have easily gone unnoticed if it hadn&#x2019;t been for an astute researcher. When Giacomo Rizzolatti, a neurophysicist at the University of Parma, and his research team began their now-famous experiment, they were not intending to explore how human beings interact. In fact, they were not even studying people. The Italian researchers were mapping a small area, known as <i>F5</i>, in the brains of the macaque monkey. At this point in neurological research, it was already well known that the F5 neurons fire when a monkey reaches his arm and hand away from his body to grasp an object.</p><p>One routine day in the lab, a researcher observed something unprecedented. The researcher was standing in the line of sight of a monkey whose F5 cells had been implanted with micro-sized electrodes. As the researcher reached out to grasp an object, the electrodes placed on the monkey&#x2019;s F5 area activated.</p><p>Remember: it was known that the F5 neurons activate when a monkey moves his arm to grasp something.</p><p>Then think about this: the monkey was not moving <i>his</i> arm; he was simply watching as the <i>researcher&#x2019;s</i> arm moved.</p><p>This seemed impossible. At the time of this observation, scientists believed that the nerve cells for action were separate and distinct from the nerve cells for sensory observations. Sensory neurons picked up information from the outside world; motor neurons were devoted to acting. So when the F5 area, known for its link to physical action, lit up in the brain of a monkey who was only <i>watching</i> action in someone else, it was a clear violation of this known divide. It was as if the brain of the monkey and the brain of the researcher were somehow synchronized. Even more unsettling, it was as if their brains overlapped, as if the researcher&#x2019;s physical movement existed inside the monkey.1</p><p>As Rizzolatti and other neuroscientists pursued this odd observation, they found that human brains also demonstrate this mirroring effect. In other words, you understand me by performing an act of internal mimicry&#x2014;by letting some of my actions and feelings into your head. Ask a friend to briskly rub her hands together as you watch. Chances are that as her hands become warm from the friction, your hands will start to feel warm, too. In the aftermath of the monkey experiment, it was hypothesized that our brains contain mirror neurons, nerve cells that are dedicated to the task of imitating others. Most scientists no longer feel that specific mirror neurons exist; instead, there is a brainwide mirroring system whose tasks are shared by a number of regions and pathways. The imitating effect&#x2014;the reason your hands warm up when your friend rubs hers together&#x2014;happens because neural circuits throughout your brain are copying what you hear and see. Nerves in your frontal and prefrontal cortex (the same ones that are activated when you plan to rub your own hands together and then execute that plan) begin to fire. At the same time, neurons in your somatosensory cortex, which is the area of the brain responsible for bodily sensations, activate and send you messages of friction and warmth. Deep inside your brain, <i>your</i> hands are rubbing themselves together&#x2014;even if your hands don&#x2019;t actually move.</p><p>Actually, the process goes far beyond the mere reflection of another person&#x2019;s actions. Your mirroring system is made up of neurons that can &#x201c;see&#x201d; or &#x201c;hear&#x201d; what someone else is doing. The system then recruits neurons from other areas of the brain to provide you with input not just about sensations and actions but about emotions, too. This input lets you have a comprehensive, detailed imitation of what the other person is experiencing. That&#x2019;s why you can almost instantly pick up on the emotion of another person. If you watch as I rub my hands together, your brain might read the excitement on my face as I demonstrate how the mirroring system works&#x2014;and <i>you</i> may feel some of that excitement. If you&#x2019;ve ever &#x201c;caught&#x201d; a smile that you spotted on the face of a complete stranger, or if the silent tension of your partner has caused your own heart to race, you&#x2019;ve experienced the effects of the mirroring system. This emotional contagion is caused by a neural pathway that can, in effect, take in another person&#x2019;s feelings and replicate them squarely inside you.</p><p>When I ask groups of people to try the hand-rubbing experiment, there are usually two sets of reactions. Some people are amazed, as if they&#x2019;ve just watched themselves pull a rabbit out of a hat. Their neurological connection with others feels like magic. But other people immediately say, &#x201c;This is creepy!&#x201d;</p><p>I get it. When you&#x2019;ve been taught all your life that your mind is its own little castle, one that&#x2019;s surrounded by a thick, high wall that&#x2019;s designed to keep your thoughts and feelings in and everyone else&#x2019;s out, it can be unsettling to learn about the power of the mirroring system. And in fact, the discovery of our mirroring ability challenges some traditional assumptions about how our brains and bodies are wired. Vittorio Gallese, a neurophysiologist in the Parma lab, described the role of the mirroring system in human interactions this way: &#x201c;The neural mechanism is involuntary, with it we don&#x2019;t have to think about what other people are doing or feeling, we simply know.&#x201d;2 Marco Iacoboni, a professor of psychiatry at UCLA, takes it one step further in his book <i>Mirroring People</i>. He says that the mirroring system helps us in &#x201c;understanding our existential condition and our involvement with others. [It shows] that we are not alone, but are biologically wired and evolutionarily designed to be deeply interconnected with one another.&#x201d;3</p><p>When you and I interact, an impression of the interaction is left on my nervous system. I literally carry my contact with you around inside me, as a neuronal imprint. The next time you hear someone say, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let other people affect how you feel,&#x201d; remember the mirroring system. Because we don&#x2019;t really have a choice. For good or for bad, other people affect us, and we are not as separate from one another as psychologists once thought.</p><p>Maturity Has a New Meaning</p><p>When I say that boundaries are overrated, I don&#x2019;t mean that there are absolutely no boundaries, or that all of humanity is just one big, undifferentiated, brownish-beige lump. Nor am I suggesting that anyone give up her or his own distinct personality for the sake of fitting in with a cozy, companionable group. No therapist I know believes that it&#x2019;s healthy to abandon your beliefs, preferences, and quirks for the sake of a smoothly running&#x2014;and bland&#x2014;larger whole.</p><p>For decades, in fact, psychology moved in the other direction, in the belief that the only path to human growth was traveled via emotional separation. According to separation-individuation theory, which was most energetically advanced by Margaret Mahler in the 1970s, we all begin our work of separation in the first six or seven months of life, when we start to realize that our caregiver is a person distinct from ourselves. Separation-individuation theory holds that the rest of life is a variation on this discovery. In the <i>practicing</i> stage of human development, we supposedly practice separation by crawling or toddling away from our mothers and then returning to their arms. In the <i>object constancy</i> stage, we develop the capacity to hold an abstract image of Mom in our minds, meaning that we are secure enough to venture farther and farther away from her, thus developing our independence. As school-aged children, we become more aggressive in an attempt to move forward with our individual desires. In adolescence, we move further away from our parents by developing a sexual identity and pairing off with our peers. Adulthood? It&#x2019;s a constant process of refining our ability to stand on our own, soothe our own distress, and solve our own problems. With each stage, the boundary between the self and other people grows stronger, more solid. Separation-individuation theory has been written about in thousands of books and dissertations, but here&#x2019;s a micro-summary: in order to grow, we must step farther and farther away from others. The fully mature person may enjoy other people but doesn&#x2019;t really <i>need </i>them. He is defined by the firm boundaries between himself and other people, and within those boundaries he is a self-sufficient being.</p><p>Even before the mirroring system came on the scene, and before relational neuroscience began to turn up additional evidence for the biological basis of human connectedness, some in the field wondered whether the separation model had gone too far. In the 1970s, a forward-looking group of Boston mental health experts&#x2014;psychiatrist Jean Baker Miller and psychologists Judith V. Jordan, Irene Stiver, and Janet Surrey&#x2014;noticed that their patients weren&#x2019;t suffering from poor boundaries. They weren&#x2019;t suffering from a lack of personal independence from others. What they suffered from was a lack of healthy human connection. As Judith Jordan notes, &#x201c;The Separate Self model has wrongly suggested that we are intrinsically motivated to build firmer boundaries, gain power over other people in order to establish safety, and compete with others for scarce resources. Mutuality helps us see that human beings thrive in relationships in which both people are growing and contributing...</p></p><h2>Socialism 101: From the Bolsheviks and Karl Marx to Universal Healthcare and the Democratic Socialists, Everything You Need to Know about Socialism (Adams 101)</h2><p><b><i>Socialism 101 </i>is a comprehensive and accessible guide to the historical and modern applications of socialism.</b><br><br>In today&#x2019;s political climate, more and more presidential candidates are espousing socialist&#x2014;or democratic socialist&#x2014;policies.

The social business model has been adopted by corporations, entrepreneurs, and social activists across the globe. Its goal is to create self-supporting, viable commercial enterprises that generate economic growth as they produce goods and services to fulfill human needs. In <i>Building Social Business</i>, Yunus shows how social business can be put into practice and explains why it holds the potential to redeem the failed promise of free-market enterprise.</p><p><b>Muhammad Yunus </b>was born in Chittagong, Bangladesh, educated at Dhaka University, was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University, and became head of the economics department at Chittagong University in 1972. He is the founder of Grameen Bank. Yunus and Grameen Bank are winners of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize. <b>Karl Weber</b> is a writer based in Irvington, New York. He coauthored Yunus's best-selling book, <i>Creating a World Without Poverty</i>.Ray Porter authoritatively narrates the story of how microloans revitalized money-lending practices and female-owned businesses in Bangladesh. Porter also conveys the earnestness of Muhammad Yunus&#39;s journey from small-scale interventions in his village as a community money lender to renown as a Nobel Peace Prize winner. In places, the listener may feel the narration grows slightly plodding, an effect of the repetitive sentence rhythm. But this delivery style may be suited to the complexity of the text, which is a mixture of biographical, economic, and historical data.

Evidence suggests their mission was to blow up the Glen Canyon dam. Had they succeeded, the structure's collapse would have unleashed a 500-foot-high inland tsunami, surging across the American Southwest and pulverizing everything in its path&#x2015;crashing through the Grand Canyon, overflowing Hoover Dam, washing away downstream communities and crippling the water supply of Las Vegas, Phoenix, Tucson, Los Angeles, and San Diego.</p><p>Instead, the truck was pulled over by an unsuspecting small town cop and the outlaws opened fire. After shooting him twenty times, they blasted their way past dozens of police cars and vanished into 10,000 square miles of the harshest wilderness terrain on the North American continent. The pursuit that ensued pitted the most sophisticated law enforcement technology on the planet against three self-trained survivalists. Seventy-five local, state, and federal police agencies; dozens of swat teams; U.S. Army Special Forces and more than five hundred officers from across the country followed the fugitives into a landscape only they could survive. </p><p>Nine years later the last of the fugitives was finally accounted for, but what really happened to them remained shrouded in mystery. The first in-depth account of this sensational case, <i>Dead Run</i> is replete with overbearing local sheriffs, Native American trackers, posse's on horseback, suspicion of police cover-ups, rumors of vigilante justice, and the blunders of the nation's most exalted crime-fighters pursuing outlaws against the unforgiving backdrop of the Utah wilderness.</p><p>More than a thrilling crime story, <i>Dead Run</i> is also an examination of the seductive allure of outlaw culture in the West and how it continues to inform national attitudes toward guns, authority and unfettered freedom. Exhaustively researched, <i>Dead Run</i> offers a stunning portrayal of an enduring Wild West landscape, where the American spirit is most boldly and confusingly, even tragically, lived.</p></p><p>DAN SCHULTZ is an award-winning journalist and business writer.

Life here is not constrained. Rather, the Four Corners of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah form a cross and the lines stretch outward to an infinite western horizon. Viewed from a southwest perspective, it is an &#x201c;X&#x201d; on a map marking the location of a hard country, part real, part illusion. <br>In the blurring of that reality and illusion, glimpsed through the schlieren of superheated air shimmering above red rock canyon floors, is a heritage of guns, desperados and violence. The land and all that flows, grows or roams wild across it belongs to those who share its history, whose great-grandparents died there&#x2014;whether shot, hung or simply worked into the ground. A distrust of outsiders and the government is instinctual. And lawbreakers both factual and fictional become mythical, from Butch Cassidy to Edward Abbey&#x2019;s George Hayduke. <br>Sentiments in Four Corners are conflicted. On the one hand, right and wrong are as self-evident as white hats and black hats. Legal nuance is guffawed at as horsepucky and peacekeepers, both the Colt .45 and the men who wielded it or its modern equivalent are consigned special esteem. <br>On the other hand, there is something romantic in the ideal of the daring, wild young outlaw thumbing his nose at the law, eluding capture at impossible odds and disappearing in the untamed expanses beyond the horizon of authority. Enough to want to overlook the wrongs and rationalize the intent, sympathize, even admire. Enough to believe that Butch Cassidy, despite Hole-in-the-Wall Gang shootouts that left bodies on the ground, never really harmed anyone. Enough to cheer for George Hayduke as a lovable vandal with a noble cause. To spur rumors, in the absence of proof otherwise, that the outlaw got away, rode into the sunset and onto the plain of legend fueled by dime novels and lurid Eastern newspaper stories&#x2014;or Web sites. <br>The duality is not surprising. It is, after all, the American Wild West, a synthesis of geography and history; supernal red sunsets and bloodstained boardwalks; the ethereal silence of a desert night and the jarring crack of gunfire; truth, exaggeration and outright fabrication. Unlike those myths borrowed and burrowed into our psyche from foreign cultures, it is one of our own making, and for better or worse, a fundamental determinant of who we are as Americans. <br>Like the land and legends that created it, the spirit of the American West is too expansive to capture in cohesive thought, yet we know it by its landmarks: individualism, excess, self-reliance, resourcefulness, impatience and, above all, freedom. <br>More than the institutionalized freedoms assured by our Constitution and body of law, it was the freedom of hidden canyons, impregnable mountains and unassailable desert. You are free not because a court says so, but because you&#x2019;ve got a fast horse and a faster gun. It is the freedom of wide-open spaces; of unregulated rivers, unturned earth, unmolested cliffs and unencumbered spirit. It is the freedom of defiance; the right to spare the other cheek and answer any provocation with escalated force. <br>It is an ethic of contradictions, as a parched desert canyon channels the occasional flash flood. Where self-reliance and independence can flow over to extreme rebuke of all law and authority. Where resolve and courage to stand your ground can become a sudden torrent of violence. It is an ethic suited to making outlaws into outlaw heroes. <br>Multimillion-dollar ski homes line Butch Cassidy Drive in the town of Telluride, Colorado, on the northeastern edge of Four Corners territory. The gentrified resort community of East Coast second-home owners is uncharacteristic of the real West that rolls endlessly across successive horizons beyond it, where the vehicle of choice is a pickup truck rather than a Prius. Where ranches aren&#x2019;t hobbies but the livelihood of fourth-generation families, and everyday life still has a raw edge to it. But Telluride was not always distinct from the West. It began as a hardscrabble mining town and it is ironic that today there is a street named after Butch Cassidy. His connection to the community is not as a founder or honorable former mayor, a civic-minded resident or leading businessman. On June 24, 1889, he robbed its bank. He stole twenty thousand dollars of the town&#x2019;s money, threatened extreme violence against any citizens who might be tempted to interfere with his theft by firing warning shots in the air and, with two accomplices from nearby Cortez, Colorado, rode as fast as he could into the wild canyons over the Utah border. It was, in fact, his first bank robbery and as the plaque on the building that now sits on the bank site proudly reminds, it was on that spot that the Butch Cassidy legend began. It is even more odd that his legacy is summoned in that particular upscale subdivision. Rich Easterners taking control of the choicest Western land were exactly the people Butch Cassidy claimed to be waging his populist war of crime against. Still, even the economic descendants of his victims find Cassidy&#x2019;s outlaw hero appeal irresistible. <br>Throughout the decade that police searched for the outlaws whose story is told in the following pages, they scolded the public time and again, &#x201c;These killers are not heroes.&#x201d; Privately they were deeply frustrated by the public&#x2019;s fascination with the fugitives. But such perverse interest was inevitable; especially considering the Wild West nature of the crime. <br>The tradition of the outlaw hero is universal but it flowered most profusely in the American West. There, the distinction between an outlaw hero and an outlaw hung was not always apparent, but the trail from repugnant criminal to popular desperado was well ridden. Something about life out-of-bounds fascinated the public and even in the face of atrocious crimes, law-abiding citizens seemed more than willing to view bad guys with nervous admiration. In moments of musing as they bent to the task of ordinary life, it was as Eugene Manlove Rhodes, the &#x201c;cowboy chronicler&#x201d; who lived in and wrote about the Old West, suggested, &#x201c;Outlaws are just more interesting than in-laws.&#x201d; <br>Part of what made the celebrated outlaws of the American West interesting was their daring crimes and reckless confrontations&#x2014;in-your-face close and brazenly public. Stripped of one-hundred-plus years of fanciful pop-culture embellishment and decades of Hollywood gilding, Western gunfights were usually less knightly than legend portrays. Many were ambushes, back shootings or long-range shootouts with adversaries crouched behind cover. But others were eye-to-eye with mortal danger so imminent that a reasonable man would slip away and find someplace safe to puke. To engage in them required courage and public opinion turned on such displays of bravery, regardless of what color hat the gunman was wearing. <br>The one other standard of behavior consistently expected of our outlaw heroes was adherence to an outlaw code of honor. It was an unspoken, ill-defined standard of morality above the law that could overlook unwarranted violence, but required a measure of personal integrity: loyalty to friends and gang members, discrimination between adversaries and bystanders, and straightforward actions. If they were going to steal from you, they robbed you right up front, not by a Ponzi scheme. If they were going to kill you, they rode up and shot you. They were, in most respects, true to their word, transparent in their motivations and intentions. <br>Although not cheered as revolutionaries or vanguards of a particular political cause, Western outlaw heroes were associated with a populist philosophy. They cultivated the same &#x201c;true citizen and patriot&#x201d; image claimed by today&#x2019;s militia movement. In writings attributed to Butch Cassidy, he describes himself as &#x201c;a citizen of the United States against cattle barons.&#x201d; And in another reference, &#x201c;an outlaw fighting for settlers&#x2019; rights against large cattle companies.&#x201d; In a West where settlers sought the American Dream but where few found riches, on land they worked but of which the largest, most profitable pieces were owned by British and Eastern cattle conglomerates, railroad magnates and mining companies, it was a popular image. Even if the outlaws didn&#x2019;t redistribute their loot Robin Hood style, they were heroes just for sticking it to the establishment. <br>There is one more element common to leading Western outlaw heroes&#x2014;they got away, at least according to legend. Their ability to remain at large for years despite significant efforts to capture them bewitched the public. Better yet, some outlaws were, by legend, never captured at all. They simply eluded the law and disappeared. Jesse James lived on by the wishful thinking of his public, despite the fact that his body was positively identified by the scars of former wounds, put on ice and photographed. Billy the Kid and Butch Cassidy&#x2019;s final escapes are also based on popular rumors, but the historical record leaves room to believe that for each man, the rumor could be true. The truth, however, is not the point. We want them to have escaped. Their wild, unbounded outlaw freedom and wholehearted disregard for authority captures the public imagination and has us in some small manner rooting for the bad guy. <br>But the main reason the ideal of an outlaw hero resonates so broadly in our society, why we have created a peculiarly American variety within our broader national myth of the American West is that the Western outlaw hero is a twisted extension of core American values. <br>The desperate outlaw on the run not only had the freedom of the free-roaming cowboy disengaged with society; he pushed back at subjugating social forces&#x2014;the relentless press of civilization and regulation. For however long he could stay at large, the systematic oppression of government, bureaucracy, corporations, technology&#x2014;of ordinary do-the-right-thing life&#x2014;was overthrown. Like standing on the rim of a mesa staring westward across miles of jagged, wild country and feeling not small, but distinct and vital, the outlaw speaks to our elemental ache for individualism. The voice may not have sufficient force to drown out our social conscience or sway our better judgment that an uncaptured outlaw is a menace, but it&#x2019;s a whisper loud enough to intrigue, to rationalize and romanticize, and in the right circumstances transform a villain into a hero. <br>It is the myth of the West as much as the reality that forges our national identity. One of the great propagators of the myth, Western moviemaker John Ford, put it best in the 1962 classic, <i>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</i>. &#x201c;This is the West. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.&#x201d; <br>Hardwired by a Western narrative of guns and frontier justice, we revel in the positive attributes of strength, courage and daring action even as they open the door for acts of violence. In cheering for the outlaw hero, we are making a psychological stand for freedom, standing up to authoritarianism and dehumanizing social forces, but we are also sanctioning brutal, inhuman antisocial behavior. Historian Frederick Jackson Turner, whose preeminent Frontier Thesis first asserted that the American character was formed by the Western experience, warned of the danger of &#x201c;pressing individual liberty beyond its proper bounds.&#x201d; The proper balance is as elusive as Butch Cassidy. <br>Dynamite Dan Clifton was known as &#x201c;the most killed outlaw in America.&#x201d; A cattle rustler and train robber in Oklahoma Indian Territory, he lost three fingers in an 1893 gunfight while riding with the Doolin Gang. He was a relatively minor criminal for the times, not destined for the outlaw hall of fame. Nevertheless Clifton accumulated a sizable bounty on his head&#x2014;thirty-five hundred dollars. It was enough that posses would constantly turn in a shot-up corpse claiming the reward, but the ten-fingered bodies were quickly identified as someone other than Dynamite Dan. In those cases where the bounty hunters had the foresight to cut fingers off the unfortunate soul they had shot to pieces, they invariably chose the wrong three fingers. <br>Like Dynamite Dan, the Old West is forever vanishing, but never vanished. It is a way of life successively pronounced dead, allowing each generation in its lament to appreciate it more poignantly. The West most Americans hold in their minds, the unfenced foundational West of open-range grazing and long cattle drives, was barely of drinking age when it was reportedly strangled to death by the barbwire. <br>It died again a few years later when the 1890 census found the nation no longer had a contiguous line of settlement. American civilization stretched from Plymouth Rock to San Francisco Bay and the frontier was closed. But in case those who lived in the West hadn&#x2019;t noticed, the Census Bureau published another obituary after the 1900 census: with an average population of two people per square mile, the West was officially &#x201c;settled.&#x201d; <br>Some believed it. Western artist Frederic Remington wrote wistfully, &#x201c;I knew the wild riders and vacant land were about to vanish forever&nbsp;&#x2026; the end of three centuries of smoke and dust and sweat.&#x201d; <br>Still, like many of its legendary outlaws and lawmen, the West refused to go down easily. Train and bank robberies, horseback posse chases and six-gun shootouts continued well into the twentieth century. Historians pushed the time of death for the Old West forward to 1920, coinciding with the end of the Mexican Revolution. But as a way of life, despite the eventual sparse web of paved roads, gasoline-powered vehicles and electrification, the West persisted. In every decade, social observers continued to note its dying flickers. Writers Zane Grey and Will James found it still taking shallow breaths in the 1920s and 1930s. Cormac McCarthy found a vanishing West set in the 1930s and 1940s. And Larry McMurtry, through his character Duane Moore, traces the slow death (or lingering life) of the West through the entire second half of the twentieth century, into the twenty-first. <br>The West lives. Despite the Walmarts and tourist information centers, the satellite dishes and Social Security, there remains a vital intrinsic West that is as it always was. Many of the attitudes, loyalties and animosities rooted in the Old West have only been fanned by the ensuing decades. In vast parts of the territory that was the historical West, there are no more residents today than there were in 1900; in many counties there are fewer. Across its vast horizon, between the larger communities that dot it, even the pockmarks of mining, timber-cutting, energy and water projects are diminished by scale. In many locations, the land features are immutable. Within the millions of acres of wilderness areas and yet unfenced country there are timeless places. You can still stand on a mountaintop and gaze across broad vistas to distant ridges. Or stare up at the same immense milky night sky that trail riders did a century ago. Or bear witness to a sunset indistinguishable from those that inspired Frederic Remington and Charles Russell. <br>Beyond the real West is the mythical West; the West of movies, books, song and video games; the West of enduring legend. It is the West that leads thousands of people every year to pull off the road and stand at the graves of Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp or Wild Bill Hickok. The West that draws millions of East Coasters and Midwesterners to vacations in the Mountain States, where they stay in accommodations with cowhide-upholstered sofas and elk-antler chandeliers. The West where the receding vibrations of a wild, audacious America still tickle the hair on the back of your neck. <br>It is real and it is mythical. And one sunny morning in M...</p><h2>Antigone: A New Translation</h2><p>Among the most celebrated plays of ancient Athens, <em>Antigone</em> is one of the seven surviving dramas by the great Greek playwright, Sophocles, now available from Harper Perennial in a vivid and dynamic new translation by award-winning poet Robert Bagg. Powerfully portraying the clash between civic and familial duty&#x2014;between morality and obedience&#x2014;the play brings the Oedipus Cycle to a conclusion with the story of the tragic hero's eldest daughter <em>Antigone</em>, who courts her own death by defying the edict of Thebes's new ruler, her uncle Kreon, which forbids giving her dishonored brother a proper burial. This is Sophocles, vibrant and alive, for a new generation.<br></p><p><p>Sophocles' masterpiece <em>Antigone</em> dramatizes the terrible series of events that results when patriotism clashes with familial duty&#x2014;and hubris incites the wrath of the gods.</p><p>The sons of Oedipus have killed each other on the battlefield, but Thebes' new ruler, their uncle Kreon, decrees that only Eteokles will be granted a hero's burial; Polyneikes, who attacked his own city, is left to rot in dishonor. Their sister Antigone, enraged by the king's heartlessness, defies him by burying Polyneikes' body herself. That decision dooms her, and the consequences destroy Kreon's wife and son. A play that begins with a woman's defiance of a tyrant ends in the havoc caused by Eros, the god of love. A drama abounding with moral conundrums, Antigone is presented in an extraordinary new translation by Robert Bagg, modern in idiom while faithful to the original Greek. Ideally suited for reading, teaching, or performing, this is Sophocles for a new generation to discover and admire.</p>Robert Bagg is a recipient of the Prix de Rome for poetry and is author of critical studies of Sappho and Catallus.<br></p><h2>Managing Local Government: An Essential Guide for Municipal and County Managers</h2><p><p><strong>Managing Local Government: An Essential Guide&nbsp;for Municipal and County Managers</strong> offers a practical introduction to the changing structure, forms, and functions of local governments.

As Chicanos engaged in widespread protest in their struggle for social justice, civil rights, and self-determination, women in <em>el movimiento</em> became increasingly militant about the gap between the rhetoric of equality and the organizational culture that suppressed women's leadership and subjected women to chauvinism, discrimination, and sexual harassment. Based on rich oral histories and extensive archival research, Maylei Blackwell analyzes the struggles over gender and sexuality within the Chicano Movement and illustrates how those struggles produced new forms of racial consciousness, gender awareness, and political identities.</p><p>ï¿½Chicana Power! provides a critical genealogy of pioneering Chicana activist and theorist Anna NietoGomez and the Hijas de Cuauhtï¿½moc, one of the first Latina feminist organizations, who together with other Chicana activists forged an autonomous space for women's political participation and challenged the gendered confines of Chicano nationalism in the movement and in the formation of the field of Chicana studies.

In !Chicana Power!, Chicano studies professor Maylei Blackwell shines light on Mexican American women&#39;s fight for equality. For the book, Blackwell drew on documents written by Chicana activists and oral histories gathered over the past 20 years to create &#39;the first book-length study of women in the Chicano movement.&#39; The book focuses on Anna NietoGomez, a Chicana theorist and founder of Hijas de Cuauhtemoc, a feminist newspaper and organization from Long Beach, California, that opposed male domination, racism, and classism. Blackwell notes that Chicana activists faced numerous hurdles to social equality, foremost amongst them the &#39;chauvinism, discrimination, and sexual harrassment&#39; of male Chicano movement leaders. Tracing the role of women in the movement&#39;s development, the book paints an illuminating picture of Chicano movement history from a feminist perspective.&#34; - NACLA Report on the Americas &#34;This is an excellent study that can be used in Chicano and Chicana literature courses, as well as women&#39;s and gender studies and Latina studies classes.

The Indian Ocean and its tributary waters bear the imprint of that great, proselytizing wave of Islam that spread from its Red Sea base across the longitudes to India and as far as Indonesia and Malaysia, so a map of these seas is central to a historical understanding of the faith. This is a geography that encompasses, going from west to east, the Red Sea, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Java and South China seas. Here, in our day, are located the violence- and famine-plagued nations of the Horn of Africa, the geopolitical challenges of Iraq and Iran, the fissuring fundamentalist cauldron of Pakistan, economically rising India and its teetering neighbors Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, despotic Burma (over which a contest looms between China and India), and Thailand, through which the Chinese and Japanese, too, may help finance a canal sometime in this century that will affect the Asian balance of power in their favor. Indeed, the canal is just one of several projects on the drawing board, including land bridges and pipelines, that aim to unite the Indian Ocean with the western Pacific.<br><br>On the Indian Ocean's western shores, we have the emerging and volatile democracies of East Africa, as well as anarchic Somalia; almost four thousand miles away on its eastern shores the evolving, post-fundamentalist face of Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country in the world. No image epitomizes the spirit of our borderless world, with its civilizational competition on one hand and intense, inarticulate yearning for unity on the other, as much as an Indian Ocean map.<br><br>Water, unlike land, bears no trace of history, no message really, but the very act of crossing and recrossing it makes this ocean, in the words of Harvard professor of history Sugata Bose, a "symbol of universal humanity." There are Indian and Chinese, Arab and Persian trading arrangements creating a grand network of cross-oceanic communal ties, brought even closer over the centuries by the monsoon winds and, in the case of the Arabs, Persians, and other Muslims, by the haj pilgrimage. This is truly a global ocean, its shores home to an agglomeration of peoples of the fast-developing former "third world," but not to any superpower: unlike the Atlantic and Pacific. Here is the most useful quarter of the earth to contemplate, pace Fareed Zakaria, a "post-American" world in the wake of the Cold War and the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Rudyard Kipling's turn of phrase "east of Suez"-from the 1890 poem "Mandalay," which begins in Moulmein in Burma, on the Bay of Bengal-applies more than ever, though few may realize it.<br><br>Cold War military maps highlighted the Arctic, owing to the geography of the Soviet Union and its principal ports. Former president George W. Bush's so-called war on terrorism underscored the Greater Middle East. But the geopolitical map of the world keeps evolving. The arc of crisis is everywhere: a warming Arctic could even become a zone of contention. Because the entire globe is simply too general an instrument to focus on, thus it helps to have a specific cartographic image in mind that includes the majority of world trouble spots, while at the same time focusing on the nexus of terrorism, energy flows, and environmental emergencies such as the 2004 tsunami. Just as phrases matter for good or for bad-"the Cold War," "the clash of civilizations"-so do maps. The right map provides a spatial view of world politics that can deduce future trends. Although developments in finance and technology encourage global thinking, we are still at the mercy of geography, as the artificiality of Iraq and Pakistan attest.<br><br>Americans, in particular, are barely aware of the Indian Ocean, concentrated as they are, because of their own geography, on the Atlantic and the Pacific. World War II and the Cold War confirmed this bias, with Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, the Soviet Union, Korea, and Communist China all with Atlantic or Pacific orientations. This bias is embedded in mapping conventions: Mercator projections tend to place the Western Hemisphere in the middle, so the Indian Ocean is often split up at the far edges of the map. Yet, it is this ocean to which Marco Polo devoted almost an entire book of his travels near the end of the thirteenth century, from Java and Sumatra to Aden and Dhofar. Herein lies the entire arc of Islam, from the eastern fringe of the Sahara Desert to the Indonesian archipelago; thus it follows that the struggle against terrorism and anarchy (which includes piracy) focuses broadly on these tropical waters, between the Suez Canal and Southeast Asia. The Indian Ocean littoral, which takes in Somalia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan, constitutes a veritable networking map of al-Qaeda, as well as one of disparate groups smuggling hashish and other contraband. Indeed, Iran has supplied Hamas by a sea route from the Persian Gulf to Sudan, and then overland through Egypt.<br><br>Here, too, are the principal oil shipping lanes, as well as the main navigational choke points of world commerce-the Straits of Bab el Mandeb, Hormuz, and Malacca. Forty percent of seaborne crude oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz at one end of the ocean, and 50 percent of the world's merchant fleet capacity is hosted at the Strait of Malacca, at the other end, making the Indian Ocean the globe's busiest and most important interstate.<br><br>Throughout history, sea routes have been more important than land ones, writes Tufts University scholar Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, because they carry more goods more economically. The sea silk route from Venice to Japan across the Indian Ocean in the medieval and early modern centuries was as important as the silk route proper across Central Asia. "Whoever is lord of Malacca has his hands on the throat of Venice," went the saying. Another proverb had it that if the world were an egg, Hormuz was its yoke.<br><br>Today, despite the jet and information age, 90 percent of global commerce and two thirds of all petroleum supplies travel by sea. Globalization relies ultimately on shipping containers, and the Indian Ocean accounts for one half of all the world's container traffic. Moreover, the Indian Ocean rimland from the Middle East to the Pacific accounts for 70 percent of the traffic of petroleum products for the entire world. Indian Ocean tanker routes between the Persian Gulf and South and East Asia are becoming clogged, as hundreds of millions of Indians and Chinese join the global middle class, necessitating vast consumption of oil. The world's energy needs will rise by 50 percent by 2030, and almost half of that consumption will come from India and China. India-soon to become the world's fourth largest energy consumer after the United States, China, and Japan-is dependent on oil for more than 90 percent of its energy needs, and 90 percent of that oil will soon come from the Persian Gulf by way of the Arabian Sea. Indeed, before 2025, India will overtake Japan as the world's third largest net importer of oil after the United States and China. And as India must satisfy a population that will be the most populous in the world before the middle of this century, its coal imports from Mozambique, in the southwestern Indian Ocean, are set to increase dramatically, adding to the coal that India already imports from Indian Ocean countries such as South Africa, Indonesia, and Australia. In the future, India-bound ships will also be carrying enormous quantities of liquefied natural gas across the western half of the Indian Ocean from southern Africa, even as it continues to import gas from Qatar, Malaysia, and Indonesia. This is how African poverty may be partially assuaged: less by Western foreign aid than by robust trade with the richer areas of the former third world.<br><br>Then there is China, whose demand for crude oil doubled between 1995 and 2005, and will double again in the coming decade or two, as it imports 7.3 million barrels of crude daily by 2020-half of Saudi Arabia's planned output. More than 85 percent of that China-bound oil will pass across the span of the Indian Ocean through the Strait of Malacca: the reason China is desperate for alternative energy routes to the Pacific, as well as overland ones into China from Central Asia, Pakistan, and Burma. The combined appetites of China, Japan, and South Korea for Persian Gulf oil already make the Strait of Malacca home to half of world oil flows and close to a quarter of global trade.<br><br>"No ocean is in need of strategic stability more than the Indian Ocean, which is arguably the most nuclearized of the seven seas," notes the defense analyst Thomas P.M. Barnett. "Among the nuclear powers whose navies ply this ocean are the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and Israel."<br><br>The Indian Ocean is where the rivalry between the United States and China in the Pacific interlocks with the regional rivalry between China and India, and also with America's fight against Islamic terrorism in the Middle East, which includes America's attempt to contain Iran. Whenever U.S. Navy warships have bombed Iraq or Afghanistan, they have often done so from the Indian Ocean. The U.S. Air Force guards Iraq and Afghanistan from bases in the Persian Gulf, and from the island of Diego Garcia, smack in the center of the Indian Ocean. Any American strike against Iran-and its aftershocks, regarding the flow of oil-will have an Indian Ocean address. The same with responses to any upheaval in Saudi Arabia; or in the teeming, water- starved tinderbox of Yemen, home to twenty-two million people and eighty million firearms.<br><br>The U.S. Navy's new maritime strategy, unveiled in October 2007 at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, both states and implies that the navy will henceforth seek a sustained, forward presence in the Indian Ocean and adjacent western Pacific, but less so in the Atlantic. The U.S. Marine Corps "Vision and Strategy" statement, unveiled in June 2008, covering the years to 2025, also concludes in so many words that the Indian Ocean and its adjacent waters will be a central theater of conflict and competition. Along with its continued dominance in the Pacific, the U.S. clearly seeks to be the preeminent South Asian power. This signals a momentous historical shift away from the North Atlantic and Europe. The United States may not control events inside the "big sandbox" of the Middle East, but, as the military analyst Ralph Peters suggests, it will compensate by trying to dominate the doors in and out of the sandbox-the Straits of Hormuz and Bab el Mandeb: choke points where the naval presence of India and China will be expanding alongside America's own.<br><br>India's and China's aspirations for great-power status, as well as their quest for energy security, have compelled them "to redirect their gazes from land to the seas," write James R. Holmes and Toshi Yoshihara, associate professors at the U.S. Naval War College. Meanwhile, as Holmes and Yoshihara also note, there are "lingering questions over the sustainability of American primacy on the high seas," something that has guaranteed commercial maritime stability for decades, and has, therefore, been taken for granted, even as globalization itself has depended upon it. If we are entering a phase of history in which several nations will share dominance of the high seas, rather than one as in the recent past, then the Indian Ocean will play center stage to this more dynamic and unstable configuration.<br><br>While China seeks to expand its influence vertically, that is, reaching southward down to the warm waters of the Indian Ocean, India seeks to expand its influence horizontally, reaching eastward and westward to the borders of Victorian age British India, parallel to the Indian Ocean. Chinese president Hu Jintao, according to one report, has bemoaned China's sea-lane vulnerability, referring to it as his country's "Malacca dilemma," a dependence on the narrow and vulnerable Strait of Malacca for oil imports from which China must somehow escape. It is an old fear, for Ming China's world was disrupted in 1511 when the Portuguese conquered Malacca. In the twenty- first century an escape from the Malacca dilemma means, among other things, eventually using Indian Ocean ports to transport oil and other energy products via roads and pipelines northward into the heart of China, so that tankers do not all have to sail through the Strait of Malacca to reach their destination. This is just one reason why China wants desperately to integrate Taiwan into its dominion, so that it can redirect its naval energies to the Indian Ocean.<br><br>The Chinese military's so-called string of pearls strategy for the Indian Ocean features the construction of a large port and listening post at the Pakistani port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea, where the Chinese could monitor ship traffic through the Strait of Hormuz. There could be another Chinese-utilized port in Pakistan, at Pasni, seventy- five miles east of Gwadar and joined to it by a new highway. At Hambantota, on the southern coast of Sri Lanka, the Chinese seem to be building the oil-age equivalent of a coaling station for their ships. At the Bangladeshi port of Chittagong on the Bay of Bengal, Chinese companies have been active in developing the container port facility, where China might also be seeking naval access. In Burma, where the Chinese have given billions of dollars in military assistance to the ruling junta, Beijing is building and upgrading commercial and naval bases; constructing road, waterway, and pipeline links from the Bay of Bengal to China's Yunnan Province; and operating surveillance facilities on the Coco Islands deep in the Bay of Bengal. A number of these ports are closer to cities in central and western China than those cities are to Beijing and Shanghai. Such Indian Ocean ports, with north-south road and rail links, would help economically liberate landlocked inner China. China is reaching southward and westward, evinced by a seemingly improbable railway it hopes to construct linking its westernmost provinces-across some of the highest terrain in the world-to a copper-producing region of Afghanistan south of Kabul.<br><br>Of course, one must be extremely careful in judging China's actions in this region. What the Chinese actually plan for the Indian Ocean is still far from clear and open to debate. Some in Washington are skeptical of the whole notion of a string-of-pearls strategy. Overt bases do not conform with China's nonhegemonic, benign view of itself. The Chinese are rarely seeking outright control, standing by, as in the case of Gwadar, as the Port of Singapore Authority prepares to run the facility for decades to come. (Though, as one Singaporean official told me, his country is tiny and thus no threat to China at Gwadar.) Many</p><h2>The King Within: Accessing the King in the Male Psyche</h2><p>In this pioneering contribution to masculine psychology, Robert L. Moore, a Jungian psychoanalyst, and Douglas Gillette, a mythologist, examine the inner King-one of the four archetypes of the male psyche. Asleep-as far as Ego-awareness is concerned-for untold generations, the King at the center of every man&#39;s soul is now returning to consciousness. His return is heralded by many men&#39;s growing sense of empowered masculine authenticity and by their enlarged capacity to empower others: other men, their friends and co-workers, the women in their lives, and their children. The inner King integrates power and nurturing, firmness and caring, courage and creativity, self-affirmation and self-sacrifice. From his central position between the world of imagination and the world of action, the King within challenges every man to take up his own scepter, to dream dreams, and to make them come true. This new revised and expanded Text Edition of The King Within recounts, as did the first edition, the many gifts the King can bestow on men. It also offers expanded discussion of techniques for accessing and regulating the King&#39;s powerful energies. Most importantly, it presents, for the first time, a 47-page description of the 16 configurations in which the four archetypes appear in men&#39;s personalities. This additional section includes newly created graphics that illustrate Robert Moore&#39;s ground-breaking &#34;Structural Psychoanalysis,&#34; a new and vital integration of psychoanalytic and spiritual theories that will help men achieve a full and authentic maturity-so as to steward a new and better world into being.</p><p>Calling itself ``an operator's manual to the psyche'' of men (and a guide to their ``hard-wiring'' for women), this is also a firm if rather theoretical response to critics who charge that men's movement gatherings and exhortations are silly, reactive, and shallow. Moore (Psychology and Religion/Chicago Theological Seminary) and Gillette (a pastoral counselor) write about ``the king within''--a psychological potential that each man apparently carries--with authority and total conviction, discussing the four Jungian archetypes (``King,'' ``Warrior,'' ``Magician,'' ``Lover''), recalling their many representations in ancient and modern cultures, and examining associated patterns of energy that empower men. Readers expecting descriptions of sweat lodges and exotic rites of passage won't find them here. The authors focus on myth and ritual as psychological skills in the quest for the king within, a mature man who strives to achieve creativity and make a positive difference in the world. Although Moore and Gillette acknowledge a variety of failed specimens, from weaklings like-- they say--King Arthur and Jimmy Carter to ``Shadow Kings'' like Caligula and wayward CEOs, they concentrate on identifying positive qualities (caring, courage), on learning how to tap into them, and on empowering others to do the same. To the authors, the urge for power is no shame as long as it's channeled justly. Regrettably, Moore and Gillette rarely refer to contemporary situations and rely on alienating jargon: ``Since the fully manifested King experiences a passionate union with the Anima...Queen, a man can experience the deep Self approaching the Jungian exemplum, but his Self is likely to be asymmetrically masculine.'' For a more accessible, reality-oriented view of similar territory, try Samuel Osherson's Wrestling with Love, reviewed below. (But those attuned to the authors' approach should note that a follow-up title, The Warrior Within, is due out in August.)

It&#x2019;s still nowhere close to sunrise, and my classmates huddle under the streetlamps in the parking lot, some staying warm by smoking. I pray to God my mom doesn&#x2019;t notice them.<br> <br>No such luck. She peers through the windshield, and a familiar look of pain flashes in her eyes. She doesn&#x2019;t get super upset, though, just gets dead serious and whispers, &#x201c;Do you have your meds?&#x201d;<br> <br>I tug the zipper on my backpack&#x2019;s pocket, show her I know how to pack and triple-check the important stuff, and, by implication, have everything else under control.<br> <br>&#x201c;If anything happens, no matter what time, no matter where you are, call me, and I&#x2019;ll come right away.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s fine, Mom.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Take your pillow,&#x201d; she says for the millionth time.<br> <br>&#x201c;Love you,&#x201d; I say, which means both good-bye and no way in hell.<br> <br>And she lets me go.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>I shuffle toward the group. We&#x2019;re well into April, but at this hour it&#x2019;s cold, so I tuck my hands in my sleeves.<br> <br>My breath mists, but I have nothing on the chain-smokers exhaling those vast clouds. A part of me would love to try it, but the whole (now) only child with asthma situation makes a boy promise certain things to his mother.<br> <br>I catch Pard watching me. He exhales sideways, like a parent just caught him in the act. Something in his face, some trace of a question left over from last week, makes me turn my back on him.<br> <br>I focus on my pack and duffel, make sure I&#x2019;ve got my shit together. No one has said hi to me yet.<br> <br>They would have if Cannon were here, but Cannon isn&#x2019;t coming. Not today.<br> <br>I nod to myself like I&#x2019;ve confirmed packing what I meant to pack, and then edge closer to Reiko and that circle of girls. Her friends are recapping prom, which is just another reminder of how popular she&#x2019;s become.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I manage.<br> <br>She takes in my groggy face and gives me a little squeeze. &#x201c;Aww, Jeff.&#x201d;<br> <br>I grit my teeth and smile. We dated our freshman year, but now she treats me like I&#x2019;m a kid&#x2014;like she has matured and I haven&#x2019;t.<br> <br>The girls go on talking, cheerful despite the hour, and start chatting up their latest admissions offers. Reiko&#x2019;s going to Penn, or maybe Georgetown. She says she&#x2019;s going to check out the campus again while we&#x2019;re in D.C. this weekend. I nod and wonder if she&#x2019;d let me tag along, since I got into Georgetown too. Maybe now is my chance to ask her.<br> <br>&#x201c;You look so sleepy,&#x201d; Reiko says, and pats my cheek. If she likes touching me so much, then why did she break up with me? Except I know the answer to that already.<br> <br>I just nod, because sleepiness excuses social ineptitude.<br> <br>The girls go back to discussing their college plans while clutching pillows and putting on lip gloss, which is hot to watch and generally looking like my dream slumber party come true. Being invisible is sometimes a pretty sweet deal. I wonder how I can sit next to any of these girls for the six-hour ride. Maybe share a pillow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>But then Frye strolls up. I&#x2019;m hoping he&#x2019;ll decide to mooch a cigarette, like he mooches a ride every day to get to school, and leave us nonsmokers alone. Instead, he parks himself right in Reiko&#x2019;s physical space and says, &#x201c;Whoa, how can you look this good this early in the morning?&#x201d;<br> <br>He&#x2019;s probably not hitting on her. I mean, Frye gets in everyone&#x2019;s space. There have been a couple times when I even wondered if Frye were coming on to me, but then realized he gets thatsuperclose to everyone. Still, I smell his mouthwash from here.<br> <br>I sneak my hand over my mouth and quietly check on my own breath.<br> <br>Reiko ruffles Frye&#x2019;s hair. She has to bend backward to do it, because he&#x2019;s that close to her, leaning over, palm-tree style. She laughs, and he laughs, and then she laughs some more. When did this thing start? He&#x2019;s saying something about these YouTube videos teaching him how to give massages, and the girls are like, Show us! So he slides his hands over Reiko&#x2019;s shoulders, and I pretend to check my phone, because I can&#x2019;t watch.<br> <br>The yellow bus pulls up the same time Mr. Bailey does. He&#x2019;s toting a huge thermos of coffee. No wonder he&#x2019;s smiling.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, kids! Let&#x2019;s do this!&#x201d;<br> <br>Everyone reaches for their packs, and I wonder for the hundredth time who will sit with me now that Cannon isn&#x2019;t coming.<br> <br>On cue, my phone vibrates, for real. At 5:15 a.m.<br> <br>U on the way?<br> <br>I text him back. Lining up. Sucks you aren&#x2019;t coming.<br> <br>Screw them!<br> <br>Yeah, I text. Unfair. Of all the days to be suspended, it had to be today.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t worry. I have a plan. Revenge!<br> <br>My breath catches. Cannon always has a plan, and while I miss having him here, his plans sometimes scare me. Especially after the senior prank. How do you tell your only real friend that he went too far? He&#x2019;d only say what he&#x2019;s said countless times before: that I need to get out of my shell. Can&#x2019;t argue with that.<br> <br>What plan? I ask.<br> <br>His reply&#x2019;s as cheerfully cryptic as a fortune cookie. I&#x2019;m going to kidnap you. :)<br> <br>I think of all the things Cannon has pulled off&#x2014;high stakes poker matches, parties with insane amounts of alcohol, and then, yes, hacking&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m nervous. He means well, but still.<br> <br>What?? I text back.<br> <br>Pick you up when u get here. Meet some G friends. Party.<br> <br>G friends could mean girlfriends, or not. He&#x2019;s still on this mission to make me go to Georgetown. He&#x2019;s been talking up this guy who will get me connected to the scene there. But I don&#x2019;t buy his plan to meet me in D.C. You&#x2019;re going to drive six hours just to show me around Georgetown?<br> <br>Not going to. I&#x2019;m HERE. Gonna help you make connections for next year. Introduce u, have fun. I&#x2019;m gonna pass out. Later.<br> <br>Suddenly my chest feels tight, and it has nothing to do with the smoke. I don&#x2019;t know what Cannon has planned. Yes, I got into Georgetown, and he&#x2019;d said he knew someone there I should meet. Was he really going to introduce me to that guy? It&#x2019;s kind of nice he wants to help, except I&#x2019;m not sure who this guy is, or what he&#x2019;d expect from me. I never fully know what to expect from Cannon. It&#x2019;s never just fun with him. He&#x2019;ll get you into a party, the kind you see in movies, and then at some point he has a signature he wants you to copy, and you don&#x2019;t know whose it is or what it&#x2019;s for, but you sign a check, a really small amount, just a prank, but you feel like maybe you shouldn&#x2019;t. You just do your little part, and then he does what he does with it.<br> <br>Quintessential Cannon. I know somehow that he&#x2019;ll have Mr. Bailey&#x2019;s itinerary, and he&#x2019;ll be there, but running off to meet his friends is risky. He knows I can&#x2019;t have any trouble this semester, that I actually want to get into the schools where I&#x2019;m wait-listed, so why would he do this to me?<br> <br>I look up and see that I&#x2019;m alone outside the bus.<br> <br>I climb the iconic rubber-tread steps that seemed so huge in second grade. Come to think of it, the steps still feel huge. Buses are just weird that way.<br> <br>I hesitate just inside, front and center, and it&#x2019;s like being onstage without a script as I scan for a seat that will not lower an already shaky social standing.<br> <br>Front left, Reeve faces the back of the bus with his knees on his seat, so I get an unwanted view of his scrawny ass. He whips around to stare me down with his unibrow power. He&#x2019;s a pretty weird sight, and I wouldn&#x2019;t mind telling him so, but he&#x2019;s poised with his clipboard to record every offense against him and every breach in school regulations. He&#x2019;s been class treasurer for two years and founded the school&#x2019;s Discipline Committee (a committee of one), which basically makes him a modernized hall monitor.<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t sit at the front of the bus.<br> <br>I try to look confident, like I&#x2019;m actually going to be a famous author, and one day the popular guys in the back will say to their kids and grandkids around the Thanksgiving table, &#x201c;Jeff Chaucer, you say? Yeah, back in high school, he wrote my paper on Virginia Woolf&#x2014;I still have it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Reeve returns to his spying position as I pass him. Luckily, there are a couple free seats farther back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. except when I get there, it turns out these spaces aren&#x2019;t free after all.<br> <br>Plugged into his headphones, Mace is slumped alone where I couldn&#x2019;t see him before.<br> <br>And, like fate, Pard has the seat across the aisle. His shoes are propped on the seat, and he&#x2019;s curled around his sketchbook so I can&#x2019;t see it, but it&#x2019;s there, and he&#x2019;s drawing, like always. The little Band-Aid he&#x2019;s been wearing on his finger is gone. I&#x2019;m still not used to him without his hat&#x2014;he looks just like he did freshman year, like we&#x2019;re in a time warp, but of course, everything has changed. He doesn&#x2019;t acknowledge I&#x2019;m right here staring.<br> <br>Now I have a dilemma. When a person walks this far into a bus, you can&#x2019;t turn back. It&#x2019;s social death. Sitting near Reeve would suck, but sitting near these two guys from my past would also suck. Mace cracks his knuckles like he wants to crack my head. Even if I wanted to risk that, I won&#x2019;t risk Mace&#x2019;s epic acne, facial flakes, and eyebrow dandruff.<br> <br>That leaves Pard, who alternates between nibbling his pencil and sketching with his head down in an I don&#x2019;t see you standing right there pose. I don&#x2019;t ask for favors, not from him, not standing in the aisle, where people are watching. But I&#x2019;m Cannon&#x2019;s friend. I can do this.<br> <br>&#x201c;Move over,&#x201d; I tell his scalp. Pard&#x2019;s hair is still wet from the shower and combed, but so thin I can see his head underneath, even paler than his hair. Kind of weird-looking, yet vulnerable&#x2014;just like his face, which has never seen a shave. I&#x2019;m not exaggerating either. Not one shave, and he&#x2019;s almost eighteen. No wonder I&#x2019;m thinking of freshman year when I see his face frozen in time like that.<br> <br>His head snaps up, and his brown eyes are proof that he&#x2019;s not albino (though let&#x2019;s not rule out the possibility that he&#x2019;s wearing contacts). They also reveal the soul of a Balrog. Right now those furious eyes say how much he hates me, even as he puts his feet down and signals for me to climb over. I try to creep past without touching him, but the backs of my calves awkwardly brush his knees. The unwanted contact makes me scoot so far over that I&#x2019;d fall out if it weren&#x2019;t for the window, permanently shut.<br> <br>Pard rolls his eyes and then goes back to his sketchbook, always angled so I can&#x2019;t see, like he does when we&#x2019;re both in the library with our doctor&#x2019;s notes excusing us from PE. I don&#x2019;t know why Pard never has PE, but I&#x2019;m out whenever it&#x2019;s too strenuous. (Yes, my mother made this happen.)<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, everyone,&#x201d; Mr. Bailey says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a six-hour drive, plus breaks. Let&#x2019;s just relax and enjoy the ride, okay?&#x201d; He delivers the rules: no getting out of your seat, no eating, no drinking, no this, no that. &#x201c;Any questions?&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course, this is an open invitation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are we there yet?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I go to the bathroom?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can we get a commemorative tattoo when we get there?&#x201d;<br> <br>This from Alison, sitting like a queen bee, back center with her two football stars on either side. With one leg propped over Rooster&#x2019;s huge knee, she&#x2019;s leaning back into Kai&#x2019;s shoulder. From his right, Kai&#x2019;s girlfriend, Briony, casts spitfire looks, but Alison doesn&#x2019;t notice. Briony must lie awake at night wondering what guys see in Alison Chavez. Unlike Briony, with the blond hair, the bikini body, the baby blue eyes, Alison isn&#x2019;t that kind of pretty. But she&#x2019;s got your attention like no one else. I don&#x2019;t just mean clothes, though today&#x2019;s outfit is cowboy boots, red stockings, and a lacy baby-doll dress, all on a five-foot-eleven-inch body. I mean her. When Alison flashes that gap-toothed smile like she&#x2019;s up to something, you want to be up on it with her. You want to be the one who says the funny line that makes her tip her chin and laugh with nothing held back. And maybe I love her with something like tenderness, because in this large, lonely world, she&#x2019;s the only girl who has ever grabbed my ass.<br> <br>As the bus starts moving and pulls away from campus, the back row breaks into stupid songs and starts churning like a mosh pit. A suspiciously shaped balloon bounces over our heads, and Bryce shouts, &#x201c;Whale condom launched!&#x201d;<br> <br>Male voices chant, Keep it up, keep it up!<br> <br>Poor Mr. Bailey. He&#x2019;s a young teacher, and I think young teachers get hopeful that we&#x2019;ll like them, and we do. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean we won&#x2019;t give them crap. Nothing personal.<br> <br>But Mr. Bailey hasn&#x2019;t looked at us in the same way since the senior prank, like any kid he sees might be one of the hoodlums who trashed his house in a night of pizza and revelry, while he was at the all-weekend civics teacher conference. We didn&#x2019;t trash it that badly and thought he&#x2019;d take it in stride, maybe even see it as a sign that we think he&#x2019;s cool, but he was furious. He doesn&#x2019;t have enough to convict us, only suspect. Pard&#x2019;s done detention but seems to have told nothing. Yes, there was evidence, but it pointed only to Pard, not to Cannon. Or to me. And the guys on the bus think the only secret to keep is trashing his house, so we&#x2019;re safe there, too.<br> <br>Cannon&#x2019;s right. Everything is fine.<br> <br>&#x201c;Keep it down!&#x201d; Mr. Bailey shouts, and the guys give a deflated aww when he snatches the balloon away.<br> <br>Once the bus hits the freeway, Rooster whips out his ukulele, and it&#x2019;s hilarious to see this gigantic redhead with this itty-bitty uke, but for a linebacker, Rooster&#x2019;s playing well. Alison sings some inappropriate lyrics, bodies sway into each other, and people have more fun than they should be having on a bus. Bryce passes me a plastic cup without explaining, and one sip burns all the way down. I ignore Pard&#x2019;s jealous glances.<br> <br>The noise picks up, and there&#x2019;s a crash in the back row. An empty beer bottle rolls down the aisle.<br> <br>So it begins, even before we&#x2019;ve left quaint Canterbury, Connecticut.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pipe down!&#x201d; Mr. Bailey holds his hands like a victim in a stickup, and then, prompting the driver to pull over but not waiting for the bus to park, he grips the seats as he makes his way down the aisle. He traps the bottle under his foot and emits the mighty sigh of a severely put-upon adult. &#x201c;I am this close to turning around.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cookie, curled in the back corner as if he&#x2019;s one of the popular kids (but really just because he&#x2019;s thoroughly baked), says all dreamy-like, &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t ours, man. It was on the bus when we got here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Bailey raises an eyebrow. &#x201c;The driver told me his normal rounds are with kindergartners.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cookie&#x2019;s mouth hangs open before he manages to reply, &#x201c;I love Goldfish.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Bailey gives us all this constipated look, as if he&#x2019;s straining to connect the trashing of his house with the bottle in his hand. He grips the back of Mace&#x2019;s seat and points his nose toward the rowdy back row like he means business. &#x201c;All right. We are going to behave ourselves and not give me any more trouble. I have this.&#x201d; He brandishes the bottle as evidence of our collective sin. &#x201c;And between this and your little prank&#x201d;&#x2014;he glares at Rooster&#x2019;s faintly purple-yellow forehead, like it might be the reason for the dent in his bedroom door (it is)&#x2014;&#x201c;I can get some of you suspended. I mean it. You&#x2019;ve pushed me way too far.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suspended. That can&#x2019;t happen. Not while I&#x2019;m wait-listed at Cornell and the other low-level Ivies. Yes, I have Georgetown in the bag, unless a suspension could ruin that, but I&#x2019;m not sure I want to be a lawyer or a civil servant or whatever politics-happy Georgetown alums tend to do.

Even though it was not an exact duplicate of the original Foxworth Hall, still I quivered inside. What a price both Chris and I had paid to stand where we were now, temporary rulers over this mammoth house that should have been left in charred ruins. Once, long ago, I'd believed he and I would live in this house like a princess and prince, and between us we'd have the golden touch of King Midas, only with more control.<br><br>I no longer believed in fairy tales.<br><br>As vividly as if it had happened only yesterday, I remembered that chill summer night full of mystical moonlight and magical stars in a black velvet sky when we'd first approached this place, expecting only the best to happen. We had found only the worst.<br><br>At that time Chris and I had been so young, innocent and trusting, believing in our mother, loving her, believing as she led us and our five-year-old twin brother and sister through the dark and somehow scary night, to that huge house called Foxworth Hall, that all our future days would be colored green for wealth and yellow for happiness.<br><br>What blind faith we'd had when we tagged along behind.<br><br>Locked away in that dim and dreary upstairs room, playing in that dusty, musty attic, we'd sustained our selves by our belief in our mother's promises that someday Foxworth Hall and all its fabulous riches would be ours. However, despite all her promises, a cruel and heartless old grandfather with a bad but tenacious heart refused to stop beating in order to let four young and hopeful hearts live, and so we'd waited, and waited, until more than three long, long years passed, and Momma failed to keep her promise.<br><br>And not until the day <i>she</i> died -- and her will was read -- did Foxworth Hall fall under our control. She had left the mansion to Bart, her favorite grandson, my child by her own second husband, but until he was twenty-five, the estate was held in trust by Chris.<br><br>Foxworth Hall had been ordered reconstructed before she moved to California to find us, but it wasn't until after her death that the final touches were completed on the new Foxworth Hall.<br><br>For fifteen years the house stood empty, overseen by caretakers legally supervised by a staff of attorneys who had either written or called Chris long distance to discuss with him the problems that arose. A waiting mansion, grieving, perhaps, waiting for the day when Bart decided he'd go there to live, as we'd always presumed one day he'd do. Now he was offering this house to us for a short while, to be our own until he arrived and took over.<br><br>There was always a catch in every lure offered, whispered my ever-suspicious mind. I felt the lure now, reaching out to ensnare us again. Had Chris and I traveled such a long road only to come full circle, back to the beginning?<br><br>What would be the catch this time?<br><br>No, no, I kept telling myself, my suspicious, everdoubting nature was getting the better of me. We had the gold without the tarnish...we did! We did have to realize our just rewards some day. The night was over -- our day had finally come, and we were now standing in the full sunlight of dreams come true.<br><br>0 To actually be here, planning to live in that restored home, put sudden familiar gall in my mouth. All my pleasure vanished. I was actually realizing a nightmare that wouldn't vanish when I opened my eyes.<br><br>I threw off the feeling, smiled at Chris, squeezed his fingers and stared at the restored Foxworth Hall, risen from the ashes of the old, to confront and confound us again with its majesty, its formidable size, its sense of abiding evil, its myriad windows with their black shutters like heavy lids over stony dark eyes. It loomed high and wide, spreading over several acres in magnificent but intimidating grandeur. It was larger than most hotels, formed in the shape of a giant T, only crossed on each end to give it an enormous center section, with wings jutting off north and south, east and west.<br><br>It was constructed of rosy pink bricks. The many black shutters matched the roof of slate. Four impressive white Corinthian columns supported a gracious front portico. A sunburst of stained glass was over the black double front doors. Huge brass escutcheon plates decorated the doors and made what could have been plain rather elegant and less somber.<br><br>This might have cheered me if the sun hadn't suddenly taken a fugitive position behind a passing dark cloud. I glanced upward at a sky turned stormy and foreboding, heralding rain and wind. The trees in the surrounding forest began to sway so that birds took alarmed flight and screeched as they flew for cover. The green lawns so immaculately kept were quickly littered with broken twigs and falling leaves, and the blooming flowers in geometrically laid-out beds were lashed to the ground unmercifully.<br><br>I trembled and thought: <i>Tell me again, Christopher Doll, that it's going to work out fine. Tell me again, for I don't really believe now that the sun has gone and the storm is drawing nearer.</i><br><br>He glanced upward, too, sensing my growing anxiety, my unwillingness to go through with this, despite my promise to Bart, my second son. Seven years ago his psychiatrists had told us their treatment was successful and that Bart was quite normal and could live out his life without needing therapy on a regular basis.<br><br>To give me comfort Chris's arm lifted to encircle my shoulders. His lips lowered to brush my cheek. "It's going to work out for all of us. I know it will. We're no longer the Dresden dolls trapped in an upstairs room, dependent on our elders to do the right thing. Now we're the adults, in control of our lives. Until Bart reaches the stated age of inheritance, you and I are the owners. Dr. and Mrs. Christopher Sheffield from Marin County, California, and no one will know us as brother and sister. They won't suspect that we are truly descendants of the Foxworths. We have left all troubles behind us. Cathy, this is our chance. Here, in this house, we can undo all the harm done to us and to our children, especially Bart. We'll rule not with steel wills and iron fists, as was Malcolm's way, but with love, compassion and understanding."<br><br>Because Chris had his arm about me, holding me tight against his side, I gained strength enough to look at the house in a new light. It was beautiful. For Bart's sake we'd stay until his twenty-fifth birthday, and then Chris and I would take Cindy with us and fly to Hawaii, where we'd always wanted to live out our lives, near the sea and white beaches. Yes, that's the way it was supposed to be. The way it had to be. Smiling, I turned to Chris. "You're right. I am not afraid of this house, or any house." He chuckled and lowered his arm to my waist, pressuring me forward.<br><br>Soon after finishing high school, my first son Jory had flown to New York City to join his grandmother, Madame Marisha. There, in her ballet company, he'd soon been noticed by the critics and was given leading roles. His childhood sweetheart, Melodie, had flown east to join Jory.<br><br>At the age of twenty, my Jory had married Melodie, who was only a year younger. The pair of them had struggled and worked to reach the top. They were now the most notable ballet team in the country, a team of perfect, beautiful coordination, as if they could reach each other's mind and signal with a flash of their eyes. For five years they'd been riding the crest of success. Every performance brought rave reviews from the critics and from the public. Television exposure had given them a larger audience than they could ever have gained by personal appearances alone.<br><br>Madame Marisha had died in her sleep two years ago, though we could console ourselves by knowing she'd lived to be eighty-seven and had worked up until the very day she passed away.<br><br>Around the age of seventeen, my second son Bart had transformed almost magically from a backward student into the most brilliant one in his school. By that time Jory had flown on to New York. I had thought at the time that Jory's absence had brought Bart out of his shell and made him interested in learning. Just two days ago, he had graduated from Harvard Law School, the valedictorian of his class.<br><br>Chris and I had joined Melodie and Jory in Boston, and in the huge auditorium of Harvard Law School we'd watched Bart receive his law degree. Only Cindy, our adopted daughter, was not there. She was at her best friend's house in South Carolina. It had given me new pain to know that Bart could not let go of his envy of a girl who'd done her best to win his approval -- especially when he'd done nothing to win hers. It gave me additional pain to know that Cindy couldn't let go of her dislike of Bart long enough to help him celebrate.<br><br>"No!" she'd shouted over the telephone, "I don't care if he did send me an invitation! It's just his way of showing off. He can put ten degrees behind his name and I still won't admire or like him -- not after all he did to me. Explain to Jory and Melodie why, so their feelings won't be hurt. But you won't have to explain to Bart. He'll know."<br><br>I'd sat between Chris and Jory and stared, amazed that a son who was so reticent at home, so moody and unwilling to communicate, could rise to the top of his class and be named valedictorian. His impassioned words created a mesmerizing spell. I glanced at Chris, who looked proud enough to burst before he grinned at me.<br><br>"Wow, who would have guessed? He's terrific, Cathy. Aren't you proud? I know I am."<br><br>Yes, yes, of course, I was very proud to see Bart up there. Still, I knew the Bart behind the podium was not the Bart we all knew at home. Maybe he was safe now. Completely normal -- his doctors had said so.<br><br>To my way of thinking, there were many small indications that Bart had not changed as dramatically as his doctors thought. He'd said just before we parted, "You must be there, Mother, when I come into my own." Not a word about Chris being there with me. "It's important to me that <i>you</i> be there."<br><br>Always he had to force himself to speak Chris's name. "We'll invite Jory and his wife down, too, and, of course, Cindy." He'd grimaced just to say her name. It was beyond me how anyone could dislike a girl as pretty and sweet as our beloved adopted daughter. I couldn't have loved Cindy more if she'd been flesh of my flesh, and blood of my Christopher Doll. In a way, since she'd come to us at the age of two, she was our child, the only one we could claim as truly belonging to both of us.<br><br>Cindy was sixteen now, and much more voluptuous than I'd been at her age. But Cindy hadn't been as deprived as I. Her vitamins had come from fresh air and sunshine, both of which had been denied four imprisoned children. Good food and exercise...she'd had the best. We'd had the worst.<br><br>Chris asked if we were going to stay out here all day and wait for pelting rain to drench us both before we went inside. He tugged me forward, urging me on with his cheerful confidence.<br><br>Gradually, step by slow step, as the thunder began to crash and swiftly come closer, with the swollen, heavy sky zigzagging with frightening electrical bolts, we approached the grand portico of Foxworth Hall. <br><br>I began to notice details I'd missed before. The portico floor was made of mosaic tiles in three shades of red intricately laid to form a sunburst pattern that matched the glass sunburst over the double front doors. I looked at those sunburst windows and rejoiced. They hadn't been here before. Perhaps it was just as Chris had predicted. It wouldn't be the same, just as no two snowflakes were the same.<br><br>Then I was frowning, for to all intents and purposes, who ever saw the differences in falling snowflakes?<br><br>"Stop looking for something to steal the pleasure from this day, Catherine. I see it on your face, in your eyes. I vow on my word of honor that we will leave this house as soon as Bart has his party and fly on to Hawaii. If a hurricane comes and blows a tidal wave over our home once we're there, it will be because you expect that to happen."<br><br>He made me laugh. "Don't forget the volcano," I said with a small giggle. "It could hurl hot lava at us." He grinned and playfully spanked my bottom.<br><br>"Quit! Please, please. August tenth will see us on our plane -- but a hundred to one you'll worry about Jory, about Bart, and wonder what he's doing all alone in this house."<br><br>That's when I remembered something forgotten until now. Waiting inside Foxworth Hall was the surprise Bart had promised would be there. How strangely he'd looked when he'd said that.<br><br>"Mother, it will blow your mind when you see -- " He'd paused, smiled and looked uneasy. "I've flown down there each summer just to check things over and see that the house wasn't being neglected and left to mold and decay. I gave orders to interior decorators to make it look exactly as it used to, except for my office. I want that modern, with all the electronic conveniences I'll need. But...if you want, you can do a few things to make it cozy."<br><br>Cozy? How could a house such as this ever be cozy? I knew what it felt like to be enclosed inside, swallowed, trapped forever. I shivered as I heard the click of my high heels beside the dull thuds of Chris's shoes as we neared the black doors with their escutcheons made decorative with heraldic shields. I wondered if Bart had looked up the Foxworth ancestry and found the titles of aristocracy and the coats of arms he desperately wanted and seemed to need. On each black door were heavy brass knockers, and in between the doors a small, almost unnoticeable button to ring a bell somewhere inside.<br><br>"I'm sure this house is full of modern gadgets that would shock genuine historical Virginia homes," whispered Chris.<br><br>No doubt Chris was right.<br><br>Bart was in love with the past, but even more infatuated with the future. Not an electronic gadget came out that he didn't buy.<br><br>Chris reached into his pocket for the door key Bart had given to me just before we flew from Boston. Chris smiled my way before he inserted the large brass key. Before he could complete the turning action, the door swung silently open.<br><br>Startled, I took a step backward.<br><br>Chris pulled me forward again, speaking politely to the old man who invitingly gestured us inside.<br><br>"Come in," he said in a weak but raspy voice as he quickly looked us over. "Your son called and told me to expect you. I'm the hired help -- so to speak."<br><br>I stared at the lean old man who was bent forward so that his head projected unbecomingly, making him seem to be climbing hills even while standing on a flat surface. His hair was faded, not gray and not blond. His eyes were a watery pale blue, his cheeks gaunt, his eyes hollowed out, as if he'd suffered greatly for many, many years. There was something about him something familiar.<br><br>My leaden legs didn't want to move. The fierce wind whipped my white, full-skirted summer dress high enough to show my thighs as I put one foot inside the grand entrance foyer of the Phoenix called Foxworth Hall.<br><br>Chris stayed close at my side. He released my hand to put his arm around my shoulders. "Dr. and Mrs. Christopher Sheffield," he introduced us in his kindly way, "and you?"<br><br>The wizened old man seemed reluctant to put out his right hand and shake Chris's strong, tanned one. His thin old lips wore a cynical, crooked smile that duplicated the cock of one bushy eyebrow. "My pleasure to...</p><h2>In This Moment: Five Steps to Transcending Stress Using Mindfulness and Neuroscience</h2><p><p>Little daily hassles can add up to big, <i>big</i> stress.</p><p>Whether you're stuck in traffic, hauling your kids out the front door in the morning, dealing with a demanding boss, or worrying about money, it's easy to become overwhelmed.

Hayes, PhD</strong>, cofounder of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and author of <em>Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life </em><br><br>"Strosahl (<i>The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Depression</i>) and Robinson (<i>Real Behavior Change in Primary Care</i>) base this self-help guide on the proposal that seemingly insignificant, everyday stressors, rather than life-changing events, pose the greatest danger to the average person&#x2019;s mental and physical health. Accordingly, the authors emphasize the importance of developing healthy coping mechanisms, advising the reader on how to evaluate one&#x2019;s current state of mind.

Wendy Shalit was the first to systematically critique the &#x201c;hook-up&#x201d; scene and outline the harms of making sexuality so public.<br> <br>Today, with social media increasingly blurring the line between public and private life, and with child exploitation on the rise, the concept of modesty is more relevant than ever. Updated with a new preface that addresses the unique problems facing society now, <i>A Return to Modesty</i> shows why &#x201c;the lost virtue&#x201d; of modesty is not a hang-up that we should set out to cure, but rather a wonderful instinct to be celebrated.<br> <br><i>A Return to Modesty</i> is a deeply personal account as well as a fascinating intellectual exploration into everything from seventeenth-century manners to the 1948 tune &#x201c;Baby, It&#x2019;s Cold Outside.&#x201d; Beholden neither to social conservatives nor to feminists, Shalit reminds us that modesty is not prudery, but a natural instinct&#x2014;and one that may be able to save us from ourselves.</p><p>The 23-year-old author first heard of "modestyniks"--Orthodox Jewish women who withhold physical contact from men until marriage--while a freshman at Williams College. She was initially fascinated by the way in which they cleave to old ideals, especially amid a sexually saturated contemporary world. But more so, Wendy Shalit was aghast at how modestyniks are dismissed as sick, delusional, or repressed by the secular community. "Why," asks the author, "is sexual modesty so threatening to some that they can only respond to it with charges of abuse or delusion?" <p> In her thoughtful three-part essay, the author reveals an impressive reading list as she probes the cultural history of sexual modesty for women and considers whether this virtue may be beneficial in today's world--if not an antidote to misogyny. In an age when women are embarrassed by sexual inexperience, when sex education is introduced as early as primary school, and when women suffer more than ever from eating disorders, stalking, sexual harassment, and date rape, Shalit believes a return to modesty may place women on equal footing with men. She yearns for a time when conservatives can believe the claims of feminists and feminists can differentiate between patriarchy and misogyny and share in the dialectic of female sexuality. </p><p> While the young author's argument is often limited by naivetï¿½ and her own lack of experience, her profound intelligence and daring are undeniable. <i>A Return to Modesty</i> is a thought-provoking debut that introduces an original and exciting new feminist thinker. <i>--Kera Bolonik</i></p>Wendy Shalit began to write <i>A Return to Modesty</i> as an undergrad at Williams College, where she received her BA in philosophy. She is also the author of <i>The Good Girl Revolution </i>and her essays on literary and cultural topics have appeared in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and other publications. Now that she is the mother of three lively and opinionated children, she is more modest and humbled than ever before.</p><h2>Lenape Country: Delaware Valley Society Before William Penn (Early American Studies)</h2><p><p>In 1631, when the Dutch tried to develop plantation agriculture in the Delaware Valley, the Lenape Indians destroyed the colony of Swanendael and killed its residents. The Natives and Dutch quickly negotiated peace, avoiding an extended war through diplomacy and trade. The Lenapes preserved their political sovereignty for the next fifty years as Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, and English colonists settled the Delaware Valley. The European outposts did not approach the size and strength of those in Virginia, New England, and New Netherland. Even after thousands of Quakers arrived in West New Jersey and Pennsylvania in the late 1670s and '80s, the region successfully avoided war for another seventy-five years.</p><p><i>Lenape Country</i> is a sweeping narrative history of the multiethnic society of the Delaware Valley in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. After Swanendael, the Natives, Swedes, and Finns avoided war by focusing on trade and forging strategic alliances in such events as the Dutch conquest, the Mercurius affair, the Long Swede conspiracy, and English attempts to seize land. Drawing on a wide range of sources, author Jean R. Soderlund demonstrates that the hallmarks of Delaware Valley society&#x2014;commitment to personal freedom, religious liberty, peaceful resolution of conflict, and opposition to hierarchical government&#x2014;began in the Delaware Valley not with Quaker ideals or the leadership of William Penn but with the Lenape Indians, whose culture played a key role in shaping Delaware Valley society. The first comprehensive account of the Lenape Indians and their encounters with European settlers before Pennsylvania's founding, <i>Lenape Country</i> places Native culture at the center of this part of North America.</p></p><p>Jean R. Soderlund is Professor of History at Lehigh University and editor of William Penn and the Founding of Pennsylvania: A Documentary History, also available from the University of Pennsylvania Press.<p>Introduction</p><p>In May 1672, while traveling north through the English colonies in eastern North America, the founder of Quakerism George Fox and fellow missionaries arrived in New Castle, the small capital of the Delaware colony inhabited mostly by Dutch and English colonists. The town stood on the west bank of the river that the Lenapes, the Native Americans who dominated the region, called the Lenapewihittuck (now Delaware River). Fox and his companions quickly crossed the river, hiring Lenape guides who led them through the fertile lands of what is now southwestern New Jersey and the Pine Barrens farther east. Fox wrote to Friends in England that as they "passed through the woods, sometimes we lay in the woods by a fire and sometimes in the Indian cabins, through the bogs, rivers, and creeks and wild woods we passed. . . . I came at last and lay at one Indian king's house and he and his queen received me lovingly and his attendants also and laid me a mat to lie upon, a very pretty man and then we came to another Indian town where the king came to me and he could speak some English and he received me very lovingly and I spake to him much and his people and they were loving."</p><p>Fox and his associates called the Lenapes' territory the "Indian Country," recognizing the Natives' sovereignty over the land. They described to colleagues in England a land still dominated by Lenapes despite the settlements of Swedes and Finns along the river, the Dutch/English town of New Castle, and Quaker villages of Middletown and Shrewsbury near the Atlantic shore. The hospitality of Lenapes saved Fox and his companions from sleeping under the open sky in terrain they considered a "wilderness." The Quaker leader distinguished between the settlements of Lenapes who treated him "lovingly" and the "wild woods" full of bogs and rivers to cross, recognizing the Lenapes' authority while appreciating their kindness. He spoke several times to the Natives about religion but reported no success in convincing them to Quakerism. They rejected his spiritual authority as he depended on them for food, direction, and shelter.</p><p>The Quaker missionaries proceeded to visit Friends in New England, returning to Lenape country in September 1672, when they again traveled safely through the region by respecting the Lenapes' power and following their rules. This time, with Lenape guides, they took the more usual route across New Jersey from Manhattan to Matinicum (now Burlington) Island, moving steadily from point to point "through many Indian towns, and rivers, and bogs." They traveled through territory the Lenapes protected carefully against European settlement or passage without guides. Indeed, one night the party "found an old house, which the Indians had forced the people to desert." The Quakers learned later of several Lenape murders of Europeans in the area the previous year. The travelers safely crossed the Lenapewihittuck once again with the help of hired Lenapes and their canoes, then rode thirty miles south "and came at night to a Swede's house, and got a little straw and lay there all night." With another guide they proceeded to New Castle, where government officials offered lodging and space so that the missionaries could hold a Quaker meeting before departing for Maryland.</p><p>The Lenapes' firm grip on south and central New Jersey is clear in a map from 1673 created by a merchant named Augustine Herrman, who had settled in New Amsterdam in 1644 and then established his plantation, Bohemia Manor, on the Maryland eastern shore in 1661. Herrman labeled the country from the Lenapewihittuck to the Atlantic Ocean as "at present inhabited only or most by Indians," and he drew Lenape towns adjacent to many rivers and streams emptying into the Lenapewihittuck and the sea. Various Lenape people populated the territory as illustrated in the map (see Figure 1), including the Cohanseys, Mantes, and Armewamese, who had sold some of their lands to Europeans but retained much of New Jersey as their own. It was through this territory that, with the Natives' guidance and permission, Fox's party had crossed.</p><p>Notwithstanding its acknowledgment of the Natives' continued presence and power in the region, Fox's report to English Friends about his journey through Lenape country helped to establish the mythology that the early Delaware Valley was a wilderness inhabited by generally friendly Indians and some scattered colonists. From his few weeks in the region, Fox described a segmented society, with Lenape towns entirely separate from Swedish, Dutch, and English villages. In this short time he learned little about the society the Lenapes, Swedes, Finns, and other Europeans had built together since European arrival, and he thus gave the impression to William Penn and other Friends in England that the Lenapes' domain was ripe for Quaker colonization. Fox's narrative has given impetus to the legend that the Delaware Valley was a blank slate on which Penn and the Quakers first brought peace and justice to the Lenapes. For the Quaker founders of Pennsylvania, their descendants of the mid-eighteenth century, and historians in subsequent centuries, Delaware Valley history began in 1681 when Penn received his charter from Charles II. In creating and perpetuating this founding myth, colonists and scholars have credited Penn with efforts to form an open, tolerant society that dealt honestly and amicably with the Lenapes and other Natives. He pledged to pay a fair price for their land and to avoid the bloodshed that destroyed Native and European settlements elsewhere in eastern North America.</p><p>Like other founding myths that ignored the history of Native Americans prior to European colonization, the Pennsylvania legend wiped away the Lenapes' own history prior to contact with Europeans as well as the sixty-five years of exchange, conflict, accommodation, and alliance between the Natives and the Dutch, Swedes, Finns, and English. Native Americans kept alive evidence of past events through spoken narratives rather than written documents, and most European settlers had little interest in recording the oral history of the original inhabitants. The colonists who described the Lenapes and their culture were more interested in their current practices and condition than the ways in which their society had evolved over the past fifty to one hundred years. Similarly, the Quakers consulted Swedish and Dutch records primarily to demonstrate early European settlement in what is now Delaware to combat Lord Baltimore's claim to the region based on his 1632 charter. The Swanendael (Valley of the Swans) whaling station and plantation, founded by the Dutch in 1631 but quickly destroyed by the Lenapes, provided key evidence to support Penn's case for ownership of the Lower Counties. Beyond the needs of the boundary dispute, however, Penn's colonists had little curiosity about the society the Natives and earlier European settlers had built. Like English colonists in Jamestown, Plymouth, and Massachusetts Bay, the Friends wove a creation myth of exceptionalism, claiming for themselves a special relationship with the Lenapes based on Quaker principles of justice, peace, religious freedom, and respect for people of different backgrounds.</p><p>Because of this mythology, the Lenapes are often portrayed as a weak people lacking the numbers and fortitude to defend their homeland. The prevailing narrative ignores the period from 1615 to 1681 when the Lenapes dominated trade and determined if, when, and where Europeans could travel and take up land. Besides the Swanendael incident, no major conflict between Natives and Europeans occurred in Lenape country to rival those in other regions, such as the Anglo-Powhatan wars and Bacon's Rebellion in Virginia, the Pequot and King Philip's wars in New England, and the Kieft's and Esopus wars in New Netherland. With the massacre at Swanendael, the Lenapes established their primacy and never lost it until after Penn received his colony in 1681. This portrayal of the Lenapes as a powerless nation gained momentum soon after the fraudulent Walking Purchase of 1737, when William Penn's sons Thomas and John Penn, with James Logan, convinced the Iroquois to undercut the Lenapes' protests of land theft by asserting they were under Iroquois control. In 1742, building on earlier similar allegations that the Lenapes denied, the Onondaga sachem Canasatego called the Lenapes "women" who refused to fight but rather depended on the Iroquois for protection. Mythology created in the mid-eighteenth century to subjugate the Lenapes and divest them of their remaining territory in eastern Pennsylvania reinforced the earlier legend of the benevolent William Penn to suggest that Lenapes had never controlled their country economically or politically or had any substantial impact on the evolution of Delaware Valley society.</p><p>Most recently, the historian Bernard Bailyn has suggested that, before 1681, Lenapes lived in "bands of less than 50 related individuals, little more than extended families," much smaller than adjacent Native communities that ranged from as high as 2,000 among some Iroquois to two or three hundred among other Algonquians. Bailyn's use of the word "bands" rather than "towns" or "nations" underscores his claim that the Lenapes lacked any coherent government. In fact, the sizes of Lenape towns and their political organizations were consistent with those of many other Native societies of eastern North America. Bailyn further argues that the Lenapes were "hunters and gatherers," despite ample evidence that they grew corn and other crops. Painting with a broad brush, Bailyn characterizes the Finns, who formed a large percentage of the region's European population, as "barbarous, uncivilized frontier peoples" who participated in Sweden's expansion "overseas, to the land of equally barbarous peoples, the Lenapes, on the shores of the Delaware River." Sampling anecdotes about the early settlers and Lenapes, Bailyn misses entirely how the Native and European inhabitants collaborated politically, socially, and economically to create Delaware Valley society.</p><p>Bailyn's presentation of the seventeenth-century mid-Atlantic offers a step backward as scholars, excavating evidence from seventeenth-century records of the pre-1681 Delaware Valley, have begun to uncover aspects of this past. In recent decades, historians have used the journals, reports, and correspondence of Dutch and New Sweden officials to provide European perspectives on Lenape culture and intercultural exchanges between the Lenapes and colonists. Others have examined New Sweden within the larger framework of mid-seventeenth-century eastern North American trade and diplomacy, and they have carefully delineated relations among the Lenapes, Susquehannocks, Swedes, English, and Dutch.</p><p>Still, no sustained historical study exists for both sides of the river from Dutch arrival in the Lenapewihittuck region to the eighteenth century. Most scholars of the early Delaware Valley begin the history of relations between the Lenapes and European colonists only in 1681 with William Penn's commitment to a "holy experiment" in which the Quakers practiced their principles of nonviolence and established a society quite different from other American colonies. While some versions of this narrative acknowledge that even William Penn strayed a bit from his ideal of harmonious and just dealings with the Lenapes, all emphasize his role in setting a benchmark of amicable coexistence that subsequent provincial leaders, including Logan and Penn's sons Thomas and John, chose to disregard. The history of the Delaware Valley has also suffered from scholars' tendency to focus their work by colonial boundary rather than provide a more integrated study of the region that became New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. A number of scholars have illuminated the Lenapes' society, culture, politics, and postcontact relations with Europeans in these provinces as part of projects focusing on a state's ancient and more recent pasts. These studies are rich and insightful yet miss the ways in which Lenapes managed land and resources throughout Lenape country and responded across colonial boundaries to European settlement.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The Lenapes are an Algonquian people who at first contact with Europeans and through most of the seventeenth century controlled the country stretching from what is now central and southern New Jersey through eastern Pennsylvania to Cape Henlopen in Delaware. They spoke the Unami (or Lenape) language, which was closely related to but distinct from other Algonquian dialects. Lenape in Unami means an "ordinary, real, original" person, and it was the word by which Lenapes referred to themselves. They affiliated closely with the Munsees, whose homeland extended from current central and northern New Jersey through southern New York. The names "Unami" and "Munsee" were the words each group used to designate the other; the word "Unami," for example, means in Munsee "person from down river." By the mid-eighteenth century, European colonists referred to both the Lenapes and Munsees as Delawares, a name many of the Natives adopted as well. Most Lenapes lived along tributaries of the Lenapewihittuck, which the Dutch and Swedes called South River, and the English named the Delaware (see Map 1). The Lenapes built unpalisaded towns that reflected their good relations with one another and propensity to avoid war with other nations. The Lenapes held land cooperatively, by the community as a whole, not by individual members or families claiming ownership rights. Their sociopolitical structure was egalitarian and democratic: sachems, operating with the guidance of a council of elders and other leaders, held considerable authority as long as they followed the collective will of their people.</p><p>For about fifteen years after the first Dutch ships entered the Lenapewihittuck, Dutch-Lenape relations focused on trade. Then in 1631, Dutch investors sent men to Cape Henlopen in Delaware to build a plantation colony they called Swanendael on land purchased from the Sickoneysincks, the southernmost community of Lenapes. Believing that they had sold a site that was to be a trading fort rather than an agricultural plantation, the Sickoneysincks killed all the residents and destroyed the settlement. Thus they prevented the Dutch from establishing an agricultural economy on Lenapewihittuck, demanding instead that the Dutch obtain goods only through trade. After 1631, under Lenape supervision, the Dutch reverted to their practice of conducting the fur trade from a small fort and ships. The Lenapes imposed strict limits on European settlement even as leaders of New Sweden (1638-55), the Dutch South River colonies (1655-64, 1673-74), and the Duke of York's Delaware colony (1664-73, 1674-81) claimed they had established primacy on the river. Unlike Native Americans in southern New England and the tidewater Chesapeake area, the Lenapes retained control of their country until the 1680s.</p><p>During the seventeenth century, prior to William Penn's arrival, the Lenapes and early European colonists created a society in Lenape country that preferred peaceful resolution of conflict, religious freedom, collaborative use of the land and other natural resources, respect for people of diverse backgrounds, and local governmental aut...</p></p><h2>Justice League 2: The Villain&#39;s Journey</h2><p>A<i>&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;</i>#1 bestseller<br><br> The Justice League is the greatest force for good the world has ever seen.

Her parents grip her hands-her mother's sharp nails dig into her right palm, and her father's grasp on her left is painfully tight.</p> <p>"Faster, Idotchka. Faster." They speak in unison. She trembles at the fear in their voices.</p> <p>Their pursuers draw closer, booted feet beating in tympanic hate, horses' hooves pounding ominously.</p> <p>She cannot go any faster. She feels her energy draining, her legs faltering. Tears streak her cheeks. How angry they will be with her if she should fall. She does not want them to be angry, her mamochka, her papochka.</p> <p>And then, suddenly, their race is over, and they are lifted to the heavens. They are soaring, the three of them, hands linked, hearts lightened, flying skyward. Her parents' arms have become wings that scissor their way through a sky no longer draped in velvet darkness but wondrously studded with rainbow-colored flowers. A vagrant wind plays with her auburn curls, and she laughs as the thick tendrils tickle her cheeks. Her pinafore billows out into a great puff of whiteness that will surely keep her afloat.</p> <p>She glances at her mother, who glides so easily through the air, a blackbird of a woman, her hair a cap of polished ebony, the velvet dress that hugs her slender body the color of night. She turns her head to the left and she sees that her father's beret has fallen and his fine silken hair frames his elfin face; stray strands briefly veil his bright blue eyes. He smiles; his daughter's hand is so light and trusting in his own. He is at home in this flower-strewn heaven. He will paint these skies, she knows, when they are safe and out of harm's way. But for now, their flight continues.</p> <p>They float, the three of them, like zephyrs borne on soft breezes, cushioned by gentle clouds, high above the burning villages and the dark columns of soldiers tramping the country they had once called their own. Mother Russia has cast them out. They are orphaned refugees, rootless and rejected, but they are winging their way to a safe haven. They do not speak, because language is lost to them. The quiet settles over them in a soothing coverlet embroidered with hope and promise. Wordless, soundless.</p> <p>Still half asleep, safe in her bed, she stretched languidly and opened her eyes to the golden light of early morning streaming through the wide window of her bedroom. A bird sang with plaintive sweetness and she hurried to the window. The solitary warbler teetered on a fragile branch of the lemon tree and then soared off into the cloudless summer sky.</p> <p>"Au revoir," she called softly and looked down at the garden where her parents sat opposite each other in their wicker chairs, talking softly as they sipped their morning coffee. Their voices drifted through the open window as their spoons clinked musically against their china cups.</p> <p>She watched them for a moment and then turned, stripped off her white nightgown, and stood naked before her full-length mirror. She studied the curves of her body, the fine-boned contour of her face. She lifted her mass of bright hair and allowed it to fall again to her shoulders.</p> <p>Her reflection reassured her. She passed her hands across the tender fullness of her breasts and felt the power of her nascent womanhood. She was no longer the frightened small girl of her nightmare. The dream was banished. The painful past was behind her. She had no need of a celestial haven. She willed herself to triumph over the sadness that too often lingered in the aftermath of her haunted sleep.</p> <p>She turned her head, glanced at herself in profile, practiced a smile, practiced a frown.</p> <p>Am I pretty? she wondered. Am I beautiful? Will Michel find me much changed?</p> <p>There was an impatient knock at her bedroom door; her name was called once and then again. "Mademoiselle Ida! Mademoiselle Ida!"</p> <p>The harsh voice of Katya, the Polish maid, irritable and accusatory, pierced her reverie.</p> <p>"It is very late. Your parents are waiting for you."</p> <p>"Tell them I'll be down in just a few minutes."</p> <p>A grunt and then heavy footfalls retreated in reproach.</p> <p>Ida shrugged. She knew that Katya did not like her, did not like being a maid in a Jewish home. But that was of no importance. Katya, as her mother frequently pointed out, was lucky to be working for the Chagalls. They were kind employers, Katya's wages were paid on time, she ate the same food as the family, and transport to church on Sundays and festivals was provided.</p> <p>She dismissed Katya from her thoughts, splashed her face with cold water, and dressed quickly, choosing a pale blue, pearl-buttoned dress of a gossamer fabric that slipped off easily and would let her swiftly disrobe. Her father had told her that he wanted her to pose for him before she left for the alpine encampment so that he might complete the series of nude studies he had begun months earlier, alternating at whim between watercolor and gouache, charcoal and oil.</p> <p>Her father had used his brush over the years to create a visual journal of her life, chronicling the days of her playful childhood, her moody adolescence, and now her emergent young womanhood. The title of each effort was scrawled in his looping script across the back of the work, a claim of ownership and provenance. There was Ida on the Swing, a portrait in motion, painted swiftly as she thrust herself skyward, her chubby legs vigorously pumping, the wind burnishing her cheeks. He had taken more time in painting Ida at the Window, capturing her as she stared dreamily through the shimmering glass while the sun sank over their Montchauvet home, setting the waters of the Seine on fire.</p> <p>"What are you thinking about, Idotchka?" her father had asked that day as his brush flew across the canvas, his eyes narrowed in concentration.</p> <p>She had thought then to share her recurring dream of frantic flight with him so that he might paint that nocturnal fantasy into a tactile reality, but she had remained silent. The dream was her own, not to be co-opted by his brush and palette. She took a perverse pleasure in keeping it secret. She had, after all, so few secrets from her parents. They had laid claim to every aspect of her life, keeping her close from the day of her birth. Sometimes she thought that they monitored the very breaths she took and seized upon her moods, saddened by her sadness, joyful in her joy. She choked on their vigilance; she resented their obsessive insistence that they possess every aspect of her being and then felt a disloyalty that shamed her. She was fortunate to be their daughter, the beloved legatee of their fame and fortune and unconditional love. And she loved them deeply in return.</p> <p>She understood that their concern for her was born of the uncertainty and the suffering they had endured. Of course they were frightened. She accepted their fear, submitted to it. She allowed them to believe that they were the conservators of her life. But her dreams, her beautiful and terrifying nocturnal odysseys, those were her own, as was the secret she had held so close within her heart throughout the year. It thrilled her that she had managed to refrain from telling her parents about Michel. He belonged only to her.</p> <p>Michel. Her Michel. She loved the very sound of his name. She had thought of his fine-featured face, of his soft and thoughtful voice, as the long months of their separation drifted slowly by. Her anticipation of their next meeting had intensified during these last sultry days of summer as she posed for her father, hour after hour, never stirring when he left his easel to more closely examine the dark areolae of her nipples, the tangled rise of the russet curls between her legs. The intensity of that gaze never unnerved her. He was Marc Chagall, and he looked at her neither as man nor father but as an artist in the throes of creation.</p> <p>It was Michel who saw her with a lover's eye, Michel whom she would see in only a few days' time after the long year of separation.</p> <p>She smiled at the thought, threaded a blue ribbon through her hair, and glided, barefoot, through the sunlit house to join her parents at breakfast in the walled garden. The French doors slid open and they turned to her at once, their faces bright with pleasure.</p> <p>"Ah, our Ida."</p> <p>Her father rose and kissed her on both cheeks. She knelt before her mother, felt Bella's soft hands gentle upon her head. This was, as always, their morning greeting, a coming together after a single night as though they had been long parted. It was as though they saw each day of their togetherness as a gift, her presence in their lives, and perhaps their lives themselves, as a miracle. She wondered if they ever dreamed of desperately fleeing danger and despair and flying into freedom. Perhaps their dreams, like her own, were embroidered with dark-threaded memories of the lost land of their birth, the village of their youth. Did the faces of family and friends, long vanished from their lives, drift above them in the darkness of the night, like the celestial flowers of her own dream?</p> <p>But of course, they would not share such thoughts with her. She was their pampered virginal daughter, to be vigilantly protected against the harshness of life. They had never even sent her to school because they so feared any threat and danger. Other children were cruel. Crowded classrooms bred disease. Broad avenues and narrow streets were haunted by unknown strangers, speeding vehicles. They could not risk exposing their Ida to danger. She was the repository of their past, their hope for the future, the source of their joyous present, her mother's student, her father's model, an enchanting and exuberant daughter. And she in turn worked hard to please them, to amuse them, to evoke the admiration of their friends.</p> <p>"Such a bright child."</p> <p>"Such a creative girl."</p> <p>"So charming."</p> <p>Always they had beamed and collected her accolades as though they themselves had earned them. Her effervescence delighted them; her laughter trilled through their home. Their wonderful Ida, so happy, so beautiful, and yes, perhaps even talented. The drawings of her adolescence were clever, and her paintings showed promise.</p> <p>They allowed her to begin classes at a small neighborhood art school, although Bella stood at the window, awaiting her return home.</p> <p>Always she saw the lines of tension on their faces ease when she entered, her voice lilting as she invited their amusement, telling them of the absurd tramp she had seen, wearing one red shoe, one blue shoe; the ridiculous boy in her class whose beret fell over his eyes; or the maï¿½tre who patrolled the studio singing "Sur le Pont d'Avignon." She had an ear, she had an eye, their Ida, they agreed.</p> <p>She played her role even as she slowly and determinedly forged her way free of the cocoon of their anxiety and laid claim to her life as she wished to live it. She had campaigned for their permission to join in a program geared to the young adult children of Russian Jewish ï¿½migrï¿½s, held in a French alpine encampment. It would be their gift to her on her seventeenth birthday.</p> <p>"It will make me so happy, Mamochka, Papochka. Don't you want your Ida to be happy?"</p> <p>She had danced toward them, her arms outstretched, and they had smiled, charmed by her charm. Of course they wanted her to be happy. They were pledged to her happiness. They made inquiries. The encampment was well chaperoned, and the young participants were immersed in Russian language and culture and imbued with love for the life and literature of Mother Russia. Such exposure would bring their Ida even closer to them. She would have a new understanding of their past. And most important of all, she would be happy. They agreed and paid her tuition, purchased her train ticket.</p> <p>Excitedly, during that first journey on her own, she had peered through the windows of her first-class carriage as it sped through the mountains. Shyly, she formed her first tentative friendships with other young Russian Jews. Joyously, she had locked eyes with tall and slender Michel Rapaport who spoke all the languages of her heart. She soared on the wings of her new freedom, wandered barefoot with Michel through the waving alpine grass, sat beside him at the blazing bonfires as they sang Russian folk songs and lilting chansons.</p> <p>He was a reluctant law student, a devoted son who helped his parents in their small Paris shop, determined to ease their lives by becoming a successful avocat. He and Ida were mutually constrained by familial obligations. They acknowledged that it would be impossible to meet during the ensuing months. But they were not discouraged. They would see each other at the next retreat. They were young. Oceans of time stretched out before them. In the intervening months, he sent her books of poetry and she sent him her drawings. Their intimate, innocent exchanges, packets of hope and love wrapped in brown paper, arrived by post and were easily explained away.</p> <p>"A gift from a friend," Ida told her mother.</p> <p>The months had passed, and Ida counted the days. Soon, she would count the hours and then she would board the train and travel southeast to the alpine hamlet where Michel would await her, his face bright with love.</p> <p>Seated with her parents in the garden on this sunlit morning when the branches of the fruit trees were heavy with golden pears and carmine cherries and the air was thick with the scent of rosemary that clung to the stone walls, she was suffused with contentment.</p> <p>She smiled at her parents, smiled even at sulky Katya who poured her coffee. Her father plucked up a piece of toast, crunched it noisily, and wandered into the garden, stretching out beneath the shade of an ancient olive tree.</p> <p>"Did you sleep well?" her mother asked as she spread Ida's croissant with the raspberry jam she made herself, following the instructions of the cook who had reigned over her parents' kitchen in faraway Vitebsk, the village that had been home to both Marc and Bella.</p> <p>"Very well, Mamochka. And you?"</p> <p>"We were up early. Your father didn't want to miss the first light. He is still working on the wedding studies."</p> <p>"Are they almost finished?" Ida asked. "You look tired but oh so beautiful."</p> <p>Bella wore a wide-sleeved, many-layered dress of sheer white organdy; white lilies crowned her dark hair, and pale blue circlets of kohl shadowed her eyes. The dress was familiar to Ida. Bella wore it often enough, posing as a bride beneath a wedding canopy and then as a corpse in a satin-lined casket. Marc never tired of painting her. Bella and Ida both, he claimed, were ideal models, born to his brush. They laughed at his claim, but there was pride in their melodic laughter. They were willing accomplices to the tyranny of his art, a tyranny that was occasionally arbitrary.</p> <p>Ida remembered complaining to her father that he never asked her to pose in bridal finery, nor in the winding linen of a shroud, her mother's frequent r...</p></p><h2>You Can't Spell Truth Without Ruth: An Unauthorized Collection of Witty &amp; Wise Quotes from the Queen of Supreme, Ruth Bader Ginsburg</h2><p><p><b>Speaking the Ruth to America</b></p><p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg became a Supreme Court Justice in 1993, but her popularity has exploded over the last couple of years as she has been adopted as a modern feminist icon.

With this much-needed guide, you&#x2019;ll learn to quiet your mind, relax your body, feel less tense, and finally get the sleep you need. </b></p><p>Sleep plays a crucial role in our waking lives. While we sleep, our bodies are recharging with energy, damaged tissue is repaired, and our memories are stored. When we don't get enough sleep, we are tired, less positive, less motivated, less focused, and more likely to feel depressed. We may even experience more intense cravings for high-fat, sugar-rich foods. And yet, despite the myriad advantages of getting a good night's sleep, countless people suffer from chronic insomnia. If you&#x2019;re one of them, this book can help.</p><p>In this guide, a trained mindfulness expert teams up with a behavioral sleep specialist to offer evidence-based meditations and an innovative four-week protocol to address the emotional stresses and anxieties that lie at the root of sleep issues. You&#x2019;ll learn practices grounded in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), mindful self-compassion (MSC), and guided mindfulness and acceptance for insomnia (GMATI) to alleviate the mental, emotional, and physical suffering caused by insomnia. You&#x2019;ll also learn to identify both internal and external factors that may be compromising your sleep, and develop a plan to address these issues.</p>There is nothing we can do to &#x201c;make&#x201d; ourselves fall asleep.

Michael Oldstone tells all these stories as he illuminates the history of the devastating diseases that have tormented humanity, focusing mostly on the most famous viruses. <br> Oldstone begins with smallpox, polio, and measles. Nearly 300 million people were killed by smallpox in this century alone and the author presents a vivid account of the long campaign to eradicate this lethal killer. Oldstone then describes the fascinating viruses that have captured headlines in more recent years: Ebola, Hantavirus, mad cow disease (a frightening illness made worse by government mishandling and secrecy), and, of course, AIDS. And he tells us of the many scientists watching and waiting even now for the next great plague, monitoring influenza strains to see whether the deadly variant from 1918--a viral strain that killed over 20 million people in 1918-1919--will make a comeback. For this revised edition, Oldstone includes discussions of new viruses like SARS, bird flu, virally caused cancers, chronic wasting disease, and West Nile, and fully updates the original text with new findings on particular viruses. <br> <em>Viruses, Plagues, and History</em> paints a sweeping portrait of humanity's long-standing conflict with our unseen viral enemies. Oldstone's book is a vivid history of a fascinating field, and a highly reliable dispatch from an eminent researcher on the front line of this ongoing campaign.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael B. A. Oldstone</strong> is Professor and Head of the Viral-Immunobiology Laboratory at The Scripps Research Institute. A leader in the field, he has been the recipient of numerous awards and honors and has served or serves on several national and international committees charged with understanding, treating and eliminating viral diseases.

He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences.<br><br>"Readable books about viruses by experts are not plentiful enough, and the point of this essay is to recommend a recent arrival by the American virologist Michael Oldstone.

Fundamentalist interpretations of the Constitution elevate certain constitutional rights above all others, benefit the most powerful members of society, and undermine the integrity of the document as a whole. The conservative fetish for the Second Amendment (enforced by groups such as the NRA) provides an obvious example of constitutional fundamentalism; the liberal fetish for the First Amendment (enforced by groups such as the ACLU) is less obvious but no less influential. Economic and civil libertarianism have increasingly merged to produce a deregulatory, "free-market" approach to constitutional rights that achieves fullest expression in the idealization of the Internet. The worship of guns, speech, and the Internet in the name of the Constitution has blurred the boundaries between conduct and speech and between veneration and violence. </p> <p>But the Constitution itself contains the antidote to fundamentalism. <i> The Cult of the Constitution</i> lays bare the dark, antidemocratic consequences of constitutional fundamentalism and urges readers to take the Constitution seriously, not selectively. </p></p><p><b>Mary Anne Franks</b> is Professor of Law at the University of Miami School of Law and President and Legislative &amp; Tech Policy Director at the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI). Franks' writing and research have been featured in <i>Time</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, and <i>The Guardian</i>, among other outlets."Mary Anne Franks has written a powerful challenge to the prevailing constitutional orthodoxy of the right and the left. Her trenchant critique of progressives' naive devotion to America's flawed founding charter is provocative and persuasive. A deeply troubling and absolutely vital book." (Mark Joseph Stern <i>Slate</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Cult of the Constitution</i> shows how gun violence, racism, and misogyny are linked by a 'fundamentalist' interpretation of First and Second Amendment rights. Like all fundamentalism, this one tends to reinforce the interests of the powerful and to perpetuate inequality. It doesn't have to be this way. At this moment of #MeToo, #BlackLivesMatter, and #NeverAgain, Mary Anne Franks' book is a necessary reassessment of constitutional orthodoxy. A powerful must-read." (Tamara Piety <i>author of <i>Brandishing the First Amendment: Commercial Speech in America</i></i>)<br><br>"Uncompromisingly critical, Franks challenges both liberal and conservative views of the Bill of Rights in the name of equality. Rights that don't work for the least powerful will ultimately work to preserve the privileges of the most powerful; agree or disagree with Franks's conclusions, her arguments require attention." (Rebecca Tushnet <i>Harvard Law School</i>)<br><br>"This is a worthy addition to the literature of critical legal studies&#x2015;and a timely text as battles over the Constitution and its interpretation continue to rage." (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>"In this timely book, Mary Anne Franks takes on some of our most divisive constitutional issues. She analyzes gun restrictions, free speech, and regulation of the internet with a firm command of the legal implications and human stakes of judicial decision making. An important and insightful book." (Deborah L.

Paul Mobley has taken his camera on the road once again, this time to photograph America&#x2019;s oldest and wisest citizens. Mobley traveled to all fifty states to find these indomitable, extraordinary centenarians. In this inspiring collection of intimate and powerful portraits, direct quotes, and personal stories, we learn that wisdom is the reward for perseverance. The centenarians in Mobley&#x2019;s stunning portfolio are eyewitnesses to a century dominated by world wars and conflicts, space travel, and cultural and digital revolutions. Their stories are inspirational, educational, and deeply touching. In them, we are reminded that love, loss, hope, and grief are essential ingredients in a full life and that humor can get us through the worst of times. Mobley&#x2019;s heartfelt portraits are a beautiful tribute to this unique assemblage of Americans. There are more than 70,000 centenarians in the United States alone. Each of them has touched others with their gift of long lives. This book is a celebration of this generation and an inspiration to the rest of us.</p><p><b>Paul Mobley</b> is an award-winning photographer recognized worldwide for his compelling portraits of celebrities and extraordinary Americans.

Over My Head is an inspiring story of how one woman comes to terms with the loss of her identity and the courageous steps (and hilarious missteps) she takes while learning to rebuild her life. The author, a 45-year-old doctor and clinical professor of medicine, describes the aftermath of a brain injury eleven years ago which stripped her of her beloved profession. For years she was deprived of her intellectual companionship and the ability to handle the simplest undertakings like shopping for groceries or sorting the mail. Her progression from confusion, dysfunction, and alienation to a full, happy life is told with restraint, great style, and considerable humor.</p><p>Until her injury in July 1988, Claudia L. Osborn taught and practiced internal medicine in a busy inner-city Detroit hospital. A graduate of Vassar College and Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine, she is currently an Associate Clinical Professor of Internal Medicine at MSU, and makes her home in Grosse Pointe, Michigan.Awareness about head-injury prevention has significantly increased in the last decade. Yet on one summer evening in 1988, a young physician out for a bicycle ride without a helmet was hit by a careless driver and sustained a devastating brain injury. This autobiographical account "from the inside looking out" details that physician's experience from the moment of impact through her remarkable comeback to resumption of teaching and research responsibilities. Her story shows the effect of a severe head injury on behavior and personality. This inspiring documentation will assist patients, families, and friends enduring the same difficulties and help health professionals understand and train their patients in the difficult rehabilitation process.

Rife with characters who stumble, speakers who suffer, and wisdoms that bristle with the darkest and lightest aspects of being alive, Modlin&#x2019;s portraits are delightful, artful, and frightening collages of the fractured individual who must daily relearn the lessons of love and grief.

His poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction have appeared in Denver Quarterly, The Florida Review, Indiana Review, DIAGRAM, River Teeth, Fourth Genre, and others.Full of essential solitudes though simultaneously lit by a whore s lightbulb against a star sky, the poems in this, Modlin's first, book are remarkable for their candor, for their wit, for their urge toward and into new moods and new modes. These poems, reminiscent of Beckian Fritz Goldberg and Norman Dubie, ask, touch me here, and we do, and we emerge humored but also transformed. In prose and in verse, the poems here, much like the book's title, have two names: holy and brilliant. --Gary McDowell, author of Mysteries in a World That Thinks There Are None, co-editor of The Rose Metal Press Field Guide to Prose Poetry<br><br>Poignant, quirky, troubled, the poems in <i>Everyone at This Party...</i> are reminiscent of James Tate, Bill Knott, and eternal Edward Lear.

Modlin navigates an entertaining hermeneutics of the everyday, grappling with relentless mutability. His whimsical metaphors and scenarios suggest that we are in thrall to the belief that by now we should understand everything; by now we should no longer be lonely.

From the 1880s to the present day.<br><br>This richly illustrated book brings these lost buildings, structures and neighborhoods back to life, to reveal the Seattle that once was.</p><p><p><b>Rob Ketcherside</b> writes about local history through a series of blended rephotography (then and now) for the Capitol Hill Seattle blog.

Rob is an appointed member of the Mayor&#x2019;s Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board, stopping more treasures from being lost. He lives in Seattle.</p>For a city that was founded as late as 1851, Seattle has a wealth of history. In less than a century, Seattle went from pioneer settlement to regional metropolis. Having lost almost all of its downtown buildings in the devastating fire of 1889, it took every bit of the city's famous "Seattle Spirit" to rebuild and start again. While many more landmarks have been lost since 1889, this richly illustrated book brings back to life the city's forgotten buildings, structures and neighborhoods to reveal the Seattle that once was.<br><br><i>Lost Seattle </i>features many previously unpublished images of architectural treasures that were lost to the wrecking ball long before the era of historic preservation. As well as the outright losses, like Yesler Mansion, Elks Hall and Kingdome, <i>Lost Seattle</i> also includes sites that have been damaged, significantly altered or repurposed over the years. Among these losses are whole areas that have been transformed (the City of Georgetown, Denny Hill and Japantown), forms of transportation that have become obsolete (interurban railways and cable cars) and buildings that have been totally reconstructed (Carnegie Central Library, Plymouth Church and the Coliseum).<br><br>Offering a rare glimpse into the past, Lost Seattle includes the extravagant buildings of the 1909 Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition and the 1962 World's Fair, elegant hotels (Occidental, Denny and Seattle), grand department stores (MacDougall &amp; Southwick and Frederick &amp; Nelson), as well as the city's once thriving theaters and picture palaces (New Pantages, Orpheum and Fox). Landmarks that have been lost more recently, like Boeing Headquarters, the Fun Forest and Fort Lawton are also featured.

For years they'd gone through cycles of estrangement and connection, drastic blow-ups and equally dramatic reconciliations. By the time her mother died at seventy-six, they hadn't spoken at all in several years. Her mother's death sent Brown on a journey of exploration, one that considered guilt and trauma, rage and betrayal, and forgiveness.<br><br><i>Shadow Daughter</i> tackles a subject we rarely discuss as a culture. Family estrangements -- between parents and children, siblings, multiple generations -- are surprisingly common, and even families that aren't officially estranged often have some experience of deep conflicts. Despite the fact that the issue touches most people one way or another, estrangement is still shrouded in secrecy, stigma, and shame. We simply don't talk about it, and that silence can make an already difficult situation even harder. Brown tells her story with clear-eyed honesty and hard-won wisdom; she also shared interviews with others who are estranged, as well as the most recent research on this taboo topic.<br><br>Ultimately, <i>Shadow Daughter</i> is a thoughtful, provocative, and deeply researched exploration of the ties that bind and break, forgiveness, reconciliation, and what family really means.<br></p><p><b>Harriet Brown</b> is the author of <i>Body of Truth </i>and<i> Brave Girl Eating</i>.

Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution engulfed millions of Chinese citizens, and the Red Guard enforced Mao's brutal communist regime. Chen&#x2019;s family belonged to the despised landlord class, and his father and grandfather were routinely beaten and sent to labor camps, the family of eight left without a breadwinner. Despite this background of poverty and danger, and Da Chen grows up to be resilient, tough, and funny, learning how to defend himself and how to work toward his future. By the final pages, when his says his last goodbyes to his father and boards the bus to Beijing to attend college, Da Chen has become a hopeful man astonishing in his resilience and cheerful strength.<i> </i></p><p>Now a writer living in New York, Da Chen describes his youth in mainland China with engaging humor and affecting warmth. It's often a harrowing tale: born in 1962, Chen was the grandson of a landlord, which rendered his entire family pariahs during the Cultural Revolution. And though initially an excellent student, he was ostracized in school and told he could never attend college. He responded by making friends with a group of young thugs who drank, smoked, and gambled but were kind to him. After Mao died in 1976, the budding juvenile delinquent discovered that higher education might be available to him after all. Chen worked hard to make up for years of neglected studies, and his memoir closes with a jubilant scene as he and his brother Jin are both accepted into college; for his suffering family, "thirty years of humiliation had suddenly come to an end." Chen's lucid yet emotional prose unsparingly portrays a topsy-turvy society where unfairness reigns and the rules are arbitrarily changed without warning, but his zest for life and sharp eye for character make even the most awful moments grimly funny. This is no saga of victimization, but a thrilling account of an ordeal that fosters spiritual growth. Readers will cheer Chen's triumph over daunting odds. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"Here is that rarity in these times, a truly marvelous book". big-hearted and humorous, written in simple, evocative prose." -<i>The Denver Post</i></p><h2>Comets, Stars, the Moon, and Mars: Space Poems and Paintings</h2><p>Blast off with Douglas Florian's new high-flying compendium, which features twenty whimsical poems about space. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the moon to the stars, from the Earth to Mars, here is an exuberant celebration&nbsp;of our celestial surroundings that's certain to become a universal&nbsp;favorite among aspiring astronomers everywhere. <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><i>Includes die-cut pages and a glossary of space terms.</i></p><p><b>DOUGLAS FLORIAN</b> is the creator of many acclaimed picture books, including <i>mammalabilia, insectlopedia, </i>and <i>beast feast</i>.

Why did this feel familiar? I put my shoulder to the wood, pressed as hard as I could, and managed to gain a few inches more, but not enough for easy access. Could I squeeze through the narrow opening? I pushed my arm and shoulder through first, forced my knee in, then my hips. My head was last, and there was a panicky moment when I thought I might get stuck there permanently, with my body half in the cabin and my head wedged between the frame and the door.</p><p>Once inside, I groped along the wall for a light switch but found none. After the brilliant sunshine of the deck above, it took more than a moment before my eyes became accustomed to the dim light in the small, fusty cabin. But once they had, I was not happy with what I saw. The long, dark shape I&#x2019;d made out peering through the cabin portholes from above was now discernible. A man was lying diagonally across the berth that filled the triangular space of the small cabin. His head was thrown back, and his mouth gaped open; a trickle of blood had dribbled from the corner of his mouth down his cheek and pooled in the creases of his neck. He was dead.</p><p>OTHER BOOKS IN THE <i>Murder, She Wrote</i> SERIES</p><p><i>Manhattans &amp; Murder</i> <br><i>Rum &amp; Razors</i> <br><i>Brandy &amp; Bullets</i> <br><i>Martinis &amp; Mayhem</i> <br><i>A Deadly Judgment</i> <br><i>A Palette for Murder</i> <br><i>The Highland Fling Murders</i> <br><i>Murder on the QE2</i> <br><i>Murder in Moscow</i> <br><i>A Little Yuletide Murder</i> <br><i>Murder at the Powderhorn Ranch</i> <br><i>Knock &#x2019;Em Dead</i> <br><i>Gin &amp; Daggers</i> <br><i>Trick or Treachery</i> <br><i>Blood on the Vine</i> <br><i>Murder in a Minor Key</i> <br><i>Provence&#x2014;To Die For</i> <br><i>You Bet Your Life</i> <br><i>Majoring in Murder</i> <br><i>Destination Murder</i> <br><i>Dying to Retire</i> <br><i>A Vote for Murder</i></p><p>SIGNET <br>Published by New American Library, a division of <br>Penguin Group (USA) Inc., 375 Hudson Street, <br>New York, New York 10014, USA <br>Penguin Group (Canada), 10 Alcorn Avenue, Toronto, <br>Ontario M4V 3B2, Canada (a division of Pearson Penguin Canada Inc.) <br>Penguin Books Ltd., 80 Strand, London WC2R 0RL, England <br>Penguin Ireland, 25 St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green, Dublin 2, <br>Ireland (a division of Penguin Books Ltd.) <br>Penguin Group (Australia), 250 Camberwell Road, Camberwell, Victoria 3124, <br>Australia (a division of Pearson Australia Group Pty.

Even then, I&#x2019;d come home to Cabot Cove on the weekends. And I don&#x2019;t mind the smell of fish. If you live in a coastal village in Maine, you get used to it. When Ethan Cragg and I used to go fishing, his boat was pretty aromatic, especially when he was cleaning our catch at the end of the day. So I know the smell of a working boat, and a lobster boat definitely falls into that category.</p><p>But this was different.</p><p>I cracked my eyes open. The sun was beating down on my head. I love the mornings when its rays slant through my east-facing windows. I like to pause, turn my back to the panes, close my eyes, and luxuriate in the sun&#x2019;s warm embrace, just for a moment, before the day&#x2019;s work pulls me away. Had I left the shades open last night? I didn&#x2019;t remember.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been dreaming about a lobster boat on the water. I shut my eyes again and tried to recapture the vision. It had to do with the upcoming lobster festival. And Spencer Durkee was there. He&#x2019;s something of a town eccentric, when he isn&#x2019;t cuddling up to a bottle down at the beach. A lobsterman for sixty-five of his more than eighty years, he regales youngsters and oldsters alike with his colorful accounts of rumrunners during Prohibition. I suspect he&#x2019;s spinning tales he&#x2019;s heard but never really experienced. All the same, everyone loves to hear him tell the stories. Yes, Spencer was in my dream. What was he doing there? We were on a boat, weren&#x2019;t we? I struggled to remember, but the details were fading away, the sun bleaching them out of my consciousness. Even so, I could still hear the quiet lapping of the sea on the hull, and feel the gentle rocking when the boat bobbed in the water.</p><p><i>What a vivid dream,</i> I thought.</p><p>Sometime during the night I must have kicked off my covers. A breeze was fluttering fabric against my legs. I felt it move across my body. I tried to turn over to escape the blinding light, but my bed was all lumpy and hard.</p><p><i>This isn&#x2019;t my bed!</i></p><p>The shock of recognition made me bolt up quickly. I cringed at the pain and reached out to steady myself, my hand pressing against a hard surface. My heart was sounding a tattoo in my chest. I tried, but couldn&#x2019;t take a deep breath, settling instead for shallow panting. Dizzy. Why was I so dizzy? And where was I?</p><p>I held perfectly still and squinted against the brilliant light. Gradually, my surroundings came into focus. Outside. I was outside; that&#x2019;s why the sun was so intense. I shaded my eyes with a trembling hand and looked down. I was sitting on a pile of rope. <i>My lumpy bed,</i> I thought, grasping a coil of the line and holding on as if it would keep me from tumbling overboard.</p><p><i>Overboard! You&#x2019;re on a boat, a lobster boat.</i></p><p>Across the beam of the boat, a white buoy painted in stripes of yellow and purple&#x2014;Spencer Durkee&#x2019;s colors&#x2014;leaned against the corner where the rail meets the washboard, a ledge that runs along the back of the boat. Two wire-and-wood lobster traps sat nearby, empty except for the three bricks in the bottom that kept them from floating along the ocean floor when the current was strong. Above me dangled the pulley of the hydraulic pot hauler, a winch used to pull lobster traps up to the surface. It was attached to the purple roof of the wheelhouse, a Spencer Durkee trademark. &#x201c;Never have no trouble pickin&#x2019; out my boat in the float.&#x201d;</p><p><i>I&#x2019;m on Spencer&#x2019;s boat, the</i> Done For<i>. How did I get here?</i></p><p>My head ached, and I squeezed my eyes closed against the throbbing. Maintaining a hold on the rope with my right hand, I gingerly probed the left side of my head, discovering a good-sized egg that was tender to the touch. I opened my eyes again and looked up. Had I hit my head against the pulley?</p><p><i>You&#x2019;d better find out what&#x2019;s going on, Jessica,</i> I told myself. <i>It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you&#x2019;re in pain. Something is terribly wrong. Get moving.</i></p><p>Every muscle in my body complained as I tried to pull myself up to a standing position. I rolled over onto my knees, but was unable to balance on the uneven surface of the rope. I crawled off the coils to the smoother planks of the platform, and slipped off my shoes. They were not appropriate for standing on a deck. <i>And a dress. I&#x2019;d never have worn a dress if I&#x2019;d known I would be on a boat.</i> Slowly I raised myself till I was standing, legs apart, knees flexed, and bent forward, the only way I could maintain my equilibrium. I took a few breaths and straightened up. Carefully I moved to the middle of the deck, sliding in my stocking feet. I untied the sleeves of a cotton sweater that was looped around my shoulders&#x2014;how did it get so dirty? I pulled it over my head and pushed my arms through. I wasn&#x2019;t cold. But the sun was high and would burn my skin to a crisp, if it hadn&#x2019;t already.</p><p>Now upright, I gazed around. Like all lobster boats, Spencer&#x2019;s sat low in the water, the rail not much more than knee height. Heavy seas would slap easily over the transom and the sides. Fortunately it was relatively calm, with a breeze raising only a slight chop, the small waves and delicate whitecaps extending as far as I could see. Alone. No land in sight, not even the slim dark blue silhouette on the horizon that indicated a terrestrial body. No. Only a straight line of water stretching away to where it met the sky. I staggered to the rail and looked toward the bow of the boat. The seascape was the same. Water. No land. But a bank of dark clouds was heading my way.</p><p><i>Well, Jessica. You&#x2019;ve been in fixes before. What do we do now?</i></p><p>My mind raced. I&#x2019;d never piloted a boat of any size other than a rowboat. Could I serve as master of this vessel? Could I find my way home? That was assuming, of course, that I could get the boat started. Had we run out of gas? The events leading up to my presence on the boat were lost in the fog of memory. I&#x2019;d heard a bump on the head could cause amnesia. Was I one of its victims? I knew who I was. But I had no recollection of how I&#x2019;d gotten here.</p><p>I swallowed convulsively and realized my throat was parched. <i>What I&#x2019;d give for a glass of water. How ironic,</i> I thought. The lines from <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i> by Samuel Taylor Coleridge sprang immediately to mind. How many times had I taught that poem?</p><p></p><p><i>Water, water, everywhere,</i> <br><i>And all the boards did shrink;</i> <br><i>Water, water, everywhere,</i> <br><i>Nor any drop to drink.</i></p><p></p><p>I took a deep breath and straightened my shoulders. The first thing to do was to look around and see what was available. Lobster boats had radios, didn&#x2019;t they? That would be a place to start.</p><p>Having a purpose gave me some energy. Perhaps there was some water on board. Maybe even something to eat. I sighed. Well, the day wasn&#x2019;t lost altogether. Spencer practically lived on his boat. There must be some supplies or emergency gear, like a flare. And if I could figure out how to operate the radio, help might be just a call away. <i>The first thing to do is to get out of the sun,</i> I told myself. <i>Then everything will fall into place.</i></p><p></p></p><h2>Nuclear Jellyfish: A Novel (Serge Storms, 11)</h2><p><p>Just when you thought it was safe to go online, Serge A.

Staking out&nbsp;some of the world&#x2019;s last dark places, photographer Beth Moon uses a digital camera to reveal constellations, nebulae, and the Milky&nbsp;Way, in rich hues that are often too faint to be seen by the naked eye. As in&nbsp;her acclaimed first volume,&nbsp;Ancient Trees: Portraits of Time, these magnificent&nbsp;images encounter great arboreal specimens, including baobabs, olive trees, and&nbsp;redwoods, in such places as South Africa, England, and California.<br><br>In her artist&#x2019;s statement, Beth Moon describes the experience of shooting at&nbsp;night in these remote places. An essay by Jana Grcevich, postdoctoral fellow of&nbsp;astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History, provides the perspective&nbsp;of a scientist racing to study the stars in a world growing increasingly&nbsp;brighter.&nbsp;Clark Strand, the author of <i>Waking Up to the Dark: Ancient Wisdom for a Sleepless Age</i>, takes a different tack, illuminating the&nbsp;inherent spirituality of trees.<br></p><p><b>Beth Moon</b> is a photographer based in New York who has gained international recognition for her large-scale, richly toned platinum prints.

Leafless branches reach for the light. On the opposite side of the sky, Earth&#x2019;s shadow is rising. True wildness manifests itself in the form of curling black branches in November, silhouetted against an indigo sky.<br><br>Time exposures blend the boundaries between the visible and the invisible. There is a middle zone where splendor comes into being, where two very different realities mingle and blur. If magic exists anywhere, it is here.</i><br><br>My work photographing trees began in 1999, when I set out to record the lives of some of the oldest trees from different parts of the world. I chose trees that were remarkable for their size, age, or history. This fourteen-year project was documented in my previous book, <i>Ancient Trees: Portraits of Time</i>.<br><br> I usually photographed in the early morning light or caught the sun low in the sky as it was about to set. Rarely did I give thought to the hours after dusk. Then I learned of two interesting studies that correlated tree growth with celestial activity, and it changed the way I looked at trees. One of these studies, conducted by researchers at the University of Edinburgh, suggests that trees may grow faster when more cosmic radiation reaches Earth&#x2019;s surface. The other was carried out by independent researcher Lawrence Edwards, who found that tree buds change shape and size rhythmically all through winter, in regular cycles corresponding to the movements of the moon and planets. The oak, for example, appears to be linked with Mars, the beech with Saturn, and the birch with Venus. Curiously, Edwards also found that overhead power lines disrupted this planetary influence.<br><br> More broadly, David Milarch, founder of the Archangel Ancient Tree Archive, has said, Trees are solar collectors. Most people equate that with the sun&#x2019;s energy. But the sun is only one star, and there are billions of stars that influence Earth with their radiation. . . . I also believe energies inside the earth are transmuted and transmitted into the cosmos by the trees, so the trees are like antennas, senders and receivers of earth energies and stellar energies.&#x201d;<br><br> These insights reminded me of how interwoven all relationships are in the natural world, where it is impossible to examine a single phenomenon without finding links to everything else. I continued to chronicle the oldest trees, but now I used the hours of darkness to photograph under the light of the stars. Full circle. This inspiration was the starting point of a new series of images that I titled Diamond Nights.<br><br> My first journey to southern Africa for this project, on what I might call a celestial safari, left me speechless under a dazzling array of stars. I don&#x2019;t think I was prepared to see the enormity of the universe laid out so starkly above me, the Milky Way stretching from one end of the horizon to the other. To find those skies, and the trees beneath them, I traveled for many hours without road signs, or even roads, to areas so remote and wild the darkness was almost palpable. If ever the night was a stage of its own, it was here.<br><br> In other countries, finding dark locations with the right degree of atmospheric clarity was challenging. Many supposed wild places&#x201d; had light pollution from nearby towns whose artificial lights overpowered the darkness. It has been said that mankind&#x2019;s destiny is written in the stars, but it will be a very bleak destiny if we can no longer see the stars. This challenge was compounded by the necessity of photographing during the months of the year when branches are bare, during a new moon, on nights without wind or clouds. The solution, of course, to all these problems was patience and time.<br><br> So that was my mantra as I waded through knee-high mud, waited out windstorms, and scouted countless locations in my search for the darkest places where the oldest trees grew. Some of the world&#x2019;s most astonishing night skies are over remote and hard-to-reach places, while others are over protected areas such as nature preserves and national forests.<br><br> Often I would determine the best viewpoints during the day, and mark them with rocks. Other times I would set up at dusk and wait. If it was cloudy, I would return throughout the night to see if the sky had cleared. In most cases, I used a wide-angle lens and an ISO of 3200 to 6400. Exposures of thirty seconds allowed enough light to enter the lens without noticeable star movement. Each location required considerable experimentation and different techniques of lighting the trees. Sometimes a short burst of diffused light from a flashlight was sufficient, or bounced light from multiple flashlights was used for a softer more natural glow.<br><br> This work marked my transition not only from film to digital capture, but also from black and white to color. Up until this point, the majority of my work was done with a medium-format film camera, but the long exposure time needed to photograph at night was not possible with film. Evolving digital technology has produced cameras with features that accommodate these conditions, such as higher ISO (light sensitivity) settings and better means of reducing the noise&#x201d; (unwanted aberrations) that occurs with long exposures.<br><br> As a platinum printer rendering images in black and white, I never imagined I would print in color. However, I was greatly surprised when I saw these new images on the viewfinder of my camera, and again the next day when I reviewed them on a larger screen. The color was so vivid! I realized the camera sensor has a much higher dynamic range of vision in the dark than people do.<br><br> The length of exposure contributes to the intensity of the color as well. In a long exposure, the camera continuously records data, stacking the light as it falls on the sensor. By comparison, the human eye processes data immediately. So in essence, long exposures allow us to see an accumulation of light that would be impossible with the unaided eye. I understood that the vibrant range of colors recorded by the camera was an integral part of the process, and therefore I felt the images should be printed in color.<br> Instead of concentrating on individual trees, in this series I considered tree species in general, and their relationship to the night sky. The trees I chose to feature were baobabs, quiver trees, bristlecone pines, junipers, olive trees, Joshua trees, sequoias, chestnuts, and oaks. The long exposures used to make these photographs emphasize the passage of time and evoke the age of the trees, which is certainly considerable although, compared to the age of the stars above, it is not even a blink of an eye.<br><br> These images chart my own fascination with the wonders of our universe and are intended to invite viewers into a mysterious, abstract world. I have intentionally omitted references to time and exact location. The ancient Greeks and Romans named the stars and constellations after varied symbols and creatures, reflecting the richness of human imagination. I have adopted these names as titles to the images in this book. The stars and constellations referenced in the titles are not necessarily visible in the images; instead, I hope the titles will serve to inspire the viewer&#x2019;s imagination.<br></p><h2>Just Breathe</h2><p><br><br>Sarah Moon tackles life's issues with a sharp wit in her syndicated comic strip,<em> Just Breathe</em>.

Maybe the experts here believed earth tones had a soothing effect on anxious, aspiring parents.

Or even that the soft shimmer of brass chimes could induce a wandering sperm to find its way home like a heat-seeking missile.<br><br>The post-procedure period, lying flat on her back with her hips elevated, was starting to feel like forever. It was no longer standard practice to wait after insemination but many women, Sarah included, were superstitious. They needed all the help they could get, even from gravity itself.<br><br>There was a quiet tap on the door, then she heard it swish open.<br><br>"How are we doing?" asked Frank, the nurse-practitioner. Frank had a shaved head, a soul patch and a single earring, and he wore surgical scrubs with little bunnies on them. Mr. Clean showing his nurturing side.<br><br>"Hoping it is a 'we' this time," she said, propping her hands behind her head.<br><br>His smile made Sarah want to cry. "Any cramps?"<br><br>"No more than usual." She lay quietly on the cushioned, sterile-draped exam table while he checked her temperature and recorded the time.<br><br>She turned her head to the side. From this perspective, she could see her belongings neatly lined up on the shelf in the adjacent dressing room: her cinnamon-colored handbag from Smythson of Bond Street, designer clothes, butter-soft boots set carefully against the wall. Her mobile phone, programmed to dial her husband with one touch, or even a voice command.<br><br>Looking at all this abundance, she saw the trappings of a woman who was cared for. Provided for. Perhaps&#x2014;no, definitely&#x2014;spoiled. Yet instead of feeling pampered and special, she simply felt... old. Like middle-aged, instead of still in her twenties, the youngest client at Fertility Solutions. Most women her age were still living with their boyfriends in garrets furnished with milk crates and unpainted planks. She shouldn't envy them, but sometimes she couldn't help herself.<br><br>For no good reason, Sarah felt defensive and vaguely guilty for going through the expensive therapies. "It's not me," she wanted to explain to perfect strangers. "There's not a thing wrong with my fertility."<br><br>When she and Jack decided to seek help getting pregnant, she went on Clomid just to give Mother Nature a hand. At first it seemed crazy to treat her perfectly healthy body as if there were something wrong with it, but by now she was used to the meds, the cramps, the trans-vaginal ultrasounds, the blood tests... and the crushing disappointment each time the results came up negative.<br><br>"Yo, snap out of it," Frank told her. "Going into a funk is bad karma. In my totally scientific opinion."<br><br>"I'm not in a funk." She sat up and offered him a smile. "I'm fine, really. It's just that this is the first time Jack couldn't make the appointment. So if this works, I'll have to explain to my child one day that his daddy wasn't present at his conception. What do I tell him, that Uncle Frank did the honors?"<br><br>"Yeah, that'd be good."<br><br>Sarah told herself Jack's absence wasn't his fault. It wasn't anyone's fault. By the time the ultrasound revealed a maturing ovarian follicle and she'd given herself the HCG injection, they had thirty-six hours for the intra-uterine insemination. Unfortunately, Jack had already scheduled a late-afternoon meeting at the work site. He couldn't get out of it. The client was coming from out of town, he said.<br><br>"So are you still trying the old-fashioned way?" Frank asked.<br><br>She flushed. Jack's erections were few and far between, and lately, he'd all but given up. "That's not going so hot."<br><br>"Bring him tomorrow," Frank said. "I've got you down for 8:00 a.m." There would be a second IUI while the window of fertility was still open. He handed her a reminder card and left her alone to put herself back together.<br><br>Her yearning for a child had turned into a hunger that was painfully physical, one that intensified as the fruitless months marched past. This was her twelfth visit. A year ago, she never thought she'd reach this milestone, let alone face it by herself. The whole business had become de-pressingly routine&#x2014;the self-injections, the invasion of the speculum, the twinge and burn of the inseminating catheter. After all this time, Jack's absence should be no big deal, she reminded herself as she got dressed. Still, for Sarah it was easy to remember that at the center of all the science and technology was something very human and elemental&#x2014;the desire for a baby. Lately, she had a hard time even looking at mothers with babies. The sight of them turned yearning to a physical ache.<br><br>Having Jack here to hold her hand and endure the New Age Muzak with her made the appointments easier. She appreciated his humor and support, but this morning, she'd told him not to feel guilty about missing the appointment.<br><br>"It's all right," she had said with an ironic smile at breakfast. "Women get pregnant without their husbands every day."<br><br>He barely glanced up from checking messages on his BlackBerry. "Nice, Sarah."<br><br>She had touched her foot to his under the table. "We're supposed to keep trying to get pregnant the conventional way."<br><br>He looked up and, for an instant, she saw a dark flash in his gaze. "Sure," he said, pushing back from the table and organizing his briefcase. "Why else would we have sex?"<br><br>This resentful attitude had started several months ago. Duty sex, for the sake of procreation, was no turn-on for either of them, and she couldn't wait for his libido to return.<br><br>There had been a time when he'd looked at her in a way that made her feel like a goddess, but that was before he'd gotten sick. It was hard to be interested in sex, Jack often said these days, after getting your gonads irradiated. Not to mention the surgical removal of one of the guys. Jack and Sarah had made a pact. If he survived, they would go back to the dream they'd had before the cancer&#x2014;trying to have a baby. Lots of babies. They had joked about his single testicle, they'd given it a name&#x2014;the Uni-ball&#x2014;and lavished it with attention. Once his chemo was finished, the doctors said he had a good chance of regaining fertility. Unfortunately, fertility had not been restored. Or sexual function, for that matter. Not on a predictable level, anyway.<br><br>They had decided, then, to pursue artificial insemination using the sperm he'd preserved as a precaution before starting aggressive treatment. Thus began the cycle of Clomid, obsessive monitoring, frequent visits to North Shore Fertility Solutions and bills so enormous that Sarah had stopped opening them.<br><br>Fortunately, Jack's medical bills were covered, because cancer wasn't supposed to happen to newlyweds trying to start a family.<br><br>The nightmare had come to light at 11:27 on a Tuesday morning. Sarah clearly remembered staring at the time on the screen of her computer, trying to remember to breathe. The expression on Jack's face had her in tears even before he said the words that would change the course of their lives: "It's cancer."<br><br>After the tears, she had vowed to get her husband through this illness. For his sake, she had perfected The Smile, the one she summoned when chemo landed him in a puking, quivering heap on the floor. The you-can-do-it-champ, I'm-behind-you-all-the-way smile.<br><br>This morning, feeling contrite after their exchange, she had tried to be sociable as she flipped through the brochure for Shamrock Downs, his current project, a luxury development in the suburbs. The brochure touted, "Equestrian center designed by Mimi Lightfoot, EVD."<br><br>"Mimi Lightfoot?" Sarah had asked, studying the soft-focus photographs of pastures and ponds.<br><br>"Big name to horse people," he assured her. "What Robert Trent Jones is to designing golf courses, she is to arenas."<br><br>Sarah wondered how challenging it was to design an oval-shaped arena. "What's she like?"<br><br>Jack had shrugged. "You know, the horsy type. Dry skin and no makeup, hair in a ponytail." He made a whinnying sound.<br><br>"You're so bad." She walked him to the door to say goodbye. "But you smell delicious." She inhaled the fragrance by Karl Lagerfeld, which she'd given him last June. She'd secretly bought it, along with a box of chocolate cigars, for Fathers Day, thinking there might be something to celebrate. When it turned out there wasn't, she had given him the Lagerfeld anyway, just to be nice. She'd eaten the chocolate herself.<br><br>She noticed, too, that he was wearing perfectly creased trousers, one of his fitted shirts from the Custom Shop, and an Hermï¿½s tie. "Important clients?" she asked.<br><br>"What?" He frowned. "Yeah. We're meeting about the marketing plans for the development."<br><br>"Well," she said. "Have a good day, then. And wish me luck."<br><br>"What?" he said again, shrugging into his Burberry coat.<br><br>She shook her head, kissed his cheek. "I've got a hot date with your army of seventeen million motile sperm," she said.<br><br>"Ah, shit. I really can't change this meeting."<br><br>"I'll be all right." Kissing him goodbye one more time, she suppressed a twinge of resentment at his testy, distracted air.<br><br>After the procedure, she followed the exit signs to the elevator and descended to the parking garage. Freakishly, the clinic had valet parking, but Sarah couldn't bring herself to use it. She was already indulged enough. She put on her cashmere-lined gloves, flexing her fingers into the smooth deerskin, then eased onto the heated leather seat of her silver Lexus SUV, which came with a built-in car seat. All right, so Jack had jumped the gun a little, buying this thing. But maybe, just maybe, nine months from now, it would be perfect. The ideal car for a soccer-mom-to-be.<br><br>She adjusted the rearview mirror for a peek at the backseat. At present, it was a jumble of drafting paper, a bag from Dick Blick Art Materials and, of all things, a fax machine, which was practically a dinosaur in this day and age. Jack thought she should let it die a natural death. She preferred to take it to a repair shop. It had been the first piece of equipment she'd bought with her earnings as an artist, and she wanted to keep it, even though no one ever faxed her anymore. She did have a career, after all. Not a very successful one, not yet, anyway. Now that Jack was cancer-free, she intended to focus on the comic strip, expanding her syndication. People thought it was simple, drawing a comic strip six days a week. Some believed she could draw a whole month's worth in one day, and then slack off the rest of the time. They had no idea how difficult and consuming self-syndication was, particularly at the beginning of a career.<br><br>When her car emerged from the parking lot, the very worst of Chicago's weather flayed the windshield. The city had its own peculiar brand of slush that seemed to fling itself off Lake Michigan, sullying vehicles, slapping at pedestrians and sending them scurrying for cover. Sarah would never get used to this weather, no matter how long she lived here. When she had first arrived in the city, a wide-eyed freshman from a tiny beach village in Northern California, she thought she'd encountered the storm of the century. She had no idea that this was normal for Chicago.<br><br>"Illinois," her mother had said when Sarah had received an offer of admission the spring of her senior year of high school. "Why?"<br><br>"The University of Chicago is there," Sarah explained.<br><br>"We have the best schools in the country right here in our backyard," her mother had said. "Cal, Stanford, Pomona, Cal Poly..."<br><br>Sarah had stood firm. She wanted to go to the University of Chicago. She didn't care about the distance or the god-awful weather or the flat landscape. Nicole Hollander, her favorite cartoon artist, had gone there. It was the place Sarah felt she belonged, at least for four years.<br><br>She'd never imagined living the rest of her life here, though. She kept waiting for it to grow on her. The city was tough and blustery, unpretentious and dangerous in some places, expansive and generous in others. Great food everywhere you turned. It had been overwhelming. Even the innate friendliness of Chicagoans had been confusing. How could you tell which ones were truly your friends?<br><br>She had always planned to leave the moment she graduated. She hadn't pictured raising a family here. But that was life for you. Filled with surprises.<br><br>Jack Daly had been a surprise as well&#x2014;his dazzling smile and irresistible charm, the swiftness with which Sarah had fallen for him. He was a Chicago native, a general contractor in the family business. His entire world was right here&#x2014;his family, friends and work. There was no question of where Sarah and Jack would live after they married.<br><br>The city itself was part of Jack's blood and bone. While most people believed life was a movable feast, Jack could not conceive of living anywhere but the Windy City. Long ago, in the dead of a brutal winter, when she hadn't seen the sun or felt a temperature above freezing for weeks, she had suggested moving somewhere a bit more temperate. He'd thought she was kidding, and they had never spoken of it again.<br><br>"I'll build you your dream house," Jack had promised her when they got engaged. "You'll learn to love the city, you'll see."<br><br>She loved him. The jury was still out on Chicago.<br><br>His cancer&#x2014;that had been a surprise, too. They had made it through, she reminded herself every single day. But the disease had changed them both.<br><br>Chicago itself was a city of change. It had burned to the ground back in 1871. Families had been separated by the wind-driven firestorm that left nothing but charred timber and ash in its wake. People torn from their loved ones posted desperate letters and notices everywhere, determined to find their way back to each other.<br><br>Sarah pictured herself and Jack stepping gingerly through the smoldering ruins as they tried to make their way back to each other. They were refugees of another kind of disaster. Survivors of cancer.<br><br>Her front tire sank into a pothole. The jolt sent an eruption of mud-colored slush across the windshield, and she heard an ominous thud from the backseat. A glance in the mirror revealed that the fax machine had done a swan dive to the floor. "Lovely," she muttered. "Just swell." She pressed the wiper fluid wand, but the ducts sputtered out only an impotent trickle. The warning light blinked <em>Empty.</em><br><br>Traffic crawled in a miserable stream northward. Stuck at a stoplight for the third cycle, Sarah thumped the steering wheel with the heel of her hand. "I don't have to sit in traffic," she said. "I'm self-employed. I might even be pregnant."<br><br>She wondered what Shirl would do in this situation. Shirl was her alter ego in Sarah's comic strip, <em>Just Breathe. </em>A sharper, more confident, thinner version of her creator, Shirl was audacious; she had a screw-you attitude and an impulsive nature.<br><br></p><h2>The Power to Change the World: The Welsh and Azusa Street Revivals</h2><p>The Power to Change the World is the remarkable story of the Welsh and Azusa Street Revivals, the two greatest revivals of the church age until this time, how they were linked to each other, and how t</p><p></p><h2>Backlands: A Novel of the American West (The American West Trilogy)</h2><p><b>In the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>Hard Country</i>, Michael McGarrity gave readers &#x201c;an expansive, lyrical period Western in the tradition of A.

Between these brutal statistics and the ill-informed, often contentious public debate stand millions of women who feel alienated, disaffected, or just plain worn out.<br> <br> In the era of #MeToo, Trump, and online harassment, innovative progressive feminist voices are more essential than ever. With her latest book, Deborah Cameron considers feminism from all sides&#x2014;as an idea, as a theoretical approach, and as a political movement. Written in the succinct, sharp style that has made Cameron&#x2019;s feminist linguistics blog so popular, this short book lays out past and present debates on seven key topics: domination, rights, work, femininity, sex, culture, and the future. <i>Feminism</i> emphasizes the diversity of feminist thought, including queer, women-of-color, and trans perspectives.

Cameron weaves together political, philosophical, social, and activist accounts to craft an impressively succinct and accessible history of what feminism is and why it matters. Pointing to some of the stickiest issues within feminism that are virtually always excluded from mainstream accounts&#x2014;such as the range of feminist views on work, reproduction, religious liberties, gender identity, and the centrality of rights&#x2014;Cameron toggles between perspectives in a way that clarifies&nbsp;rather than confounds.&#x201d; (<i>Rebecca M.

R.H.H. ï¿½ AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Uneven Ground: Appalachia since 1945</h2><p>Appalachia has played a complex and often contradictory role in the unfolding of American history. Created by urban journalists in the years following the Civil War, the idea of Appalachia provided a counterpoint to emerging definitions of progress. Early-twentieth-century critics of modernity saw the region as a remnant of frontier life, a reflection of simpler times that should be preserved and protected. However, supporters of development and of the growth of material production, consumption, and technology decried what they perceived as the isolation and backwardness of the place and sought to "uplift" the mountain people through education and industrialization.<br><br>Ronald D Eller has worked with local leaders, state policymakers, and national planners to translate the lessons of private industrial-development history into public policy affecting the region. In <i>Uneven Ground: Appalachia since 1945</i>, Eller examines the politics of development in Appalachia since World War II with an eye toward exploring the idea of progress as it has evolved in modern America. Appalachia's struggle to overcome poverty, to live in harmony with the land, and to respect the diversity of cultures and the value of community is also an American story. In the end, Eller concludes, "Appalachia was not different from the rest of America; it was in fact a mirror of what the nation was becoming."</p><p><b>Ronald D Eller</b> is former director of the Appalachian Center and professor of history at the University of Kentucky. He is the author of <i>Miners, Millhands, and Mountaineers: Industrialization of the Appalachian South, 1880&#x2013;1930</i>."<i>Uneven Ground </i>is passionate, clear, concise, and at times profound.

Ladies and gentlemen: Keith Richards.</strong><br><br>With The Rolling Stones, Keith Richards created the songs that roused the world, and he lived the original rock and roll life.<br><br>Now, at last, the man himself tells his story of life in the crossfire hurricane. Listening obsessively to Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters records, learning guitar and forming a band with Mick Jagger and Brian Jones. The Rolling Stones's first fame and the notorious drug busts that led to his enduring image as an outlaw folk hero. Creating immortal riffs like the ones in "Jumping Jack Flash" and "Honky Tonk Women." His relationship with Anita Pallenberg and the death of Brian Jones. Tax exile in France, wildfire tours of the U.S., isolation and addiction. Falling in love with Patti Hansen. Estrangement from Jagger and subsequent reconciliation. Marriage, family, solo albums and Xpensive Winos, and the road that goes on forever.<br><br>With his trademark disarming honesty, Keith Richard brings us the story of a life we have all longed to know more of, unfettered, fearless, and true.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2010</strong>: It's hard to imagine a celebrity memoir--or any memoir for that matter--that is as easy to drink in (so to speak) as Keith Richards's <i>Life</i>. Die-hard Stones fans will love tales of the band's ascension from the "interval" band at the Marquee to the headliners at Super Bowl XL; guitar gearheads will scramble to sample the one lick that has eluded Richards for 49 years; and historians and romantics alike will swoon over the raspy, rambling, raucous detail of this portrait of the artist <i>in situ</i>. Yes, some tales are told, but <i>Life</i> is refreshingly not gossipy, mean-spirited, or sordid--or at least not more than the truth demands. Richards is as comfortable in his bones as a worn pair of boots, and <i>Life</i> captures the rhythm of his voice so effortlessly that reading his tale is like sharing a pint with an old friend--one who happens to be one of the most iconic guitarists of all time. <em>--Daphne Durham</em>Keith Richards was born in England in 1943 and founded the Rolling Stones with Mick Jagger in 1962.

A novel can rise or fall on the strength of its dialogue. Superb dialogue can make a superb novel. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, Action is character.&#x201d; George V. Higgins said, Dialogue is character.&#x201d; They were both right, because dialogue is action. It comprises much, if not all, of the clarifying drama of any novel. How much physical action can there be in 300 pages, even in a crime novel or a thriller? And all conflict, even physical, begins as dialogue.<br><br>Hough explains how dialogue can reveal a character&#x2019;s nature as well as his or her defining impulses and emotions. He says there must be tension in every colloquy in fiction, and shows the reader ways to achieve it. Hough illustrates his precepts with examples from his own work and from that of the best modern writers of dialogue, including Cormac McCarthy, Kent Haruf, Joan Didion, Annie Proulx, Lee Smith, Elmore Leonard, George V. Higgins, William Kennedy and Howard Frank Mosher. He cites early 20th century writers who refined and advanced dialogue as an art form: Ernest Hemingway, Ring Lardner, Dorothy Parker, and William Saroyan.<br><br>Hough&#x2019;s novel <i>Seen the Glory: A Novel of the Battle of Gettysburg</i> was praised by Lee Smith as containing the best dialogue of the period I have ever read.&#x201d; <i>Hough on Dialogue</i> will give writers and aspiring writers a fresh look at one of the essential ingredients of their craft.<br><br>Allworth Press, an imprint of Skyhorse Publishing, publishes a broad range of books on the visual and performing arts, with emphasis on the business of art.

When the hardcover edition released in 2000, it was praised for both its breadth and depth--all aspects of Mexican history, from religion to technology, ethnicity, ecology and mass media, are analyzed with insight and clarity. Available for the first time in paperback, the History covers every era in the nation's history in chronological format, offering a quick, affordable reference source for students, scholars and anyone who has ever been interested in Mexico's rich cultural heritage.<br><br>Scholars have contributed fascinating essays ranging from thematic ("Faith and Morals in Colonial Mexico," "Mass Media and Popular Culture in the Postrevolutionary Era") to centered around one pivotal moment or epoch in Mexican history ("Betterment for Whom? The Reform Period: 1855-1875"). Two such major events are the Mexican War of Independence (1810-1821) and the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920), the subjects of several essays in the book.

Beezley also explores the significance of the bicentennial of independence and centennial of the Revolution. With these updates and a completely modern, bold new design, the reissued edition refreshes the beloved Oxford History of Mexico for a new generation.<br></p><p>With a population of nearly 100 million people, Mexico is the largest Spanish-speaking country in the world. Although contemporary American images of the country range from illegal border crossings to peasant uprisings, this important work uncovers a vital and volatile civilization with its roots in the indigenous Mayan, Olmec, and Aztec cultures, which collided with the conquering Spaniards who brought African slaves with them in the 16th century. "The course of Mexican history, as with that of any other nation, demonstrates amply that sincerity and guile can occupy the same page," the editors write. "There is much in the Mexican experience to command admiration and ennoble the human spirit, even if on a few occasions it might also cause an eyebrow to be raised." <p> In <i>The Oxford History of Mexico</i>, 21 scholars unravel Mexico's long history of Indian extermination, slavery, colonialism, and U.S. expansion with new information outlining environmental, gender, and pop culture studies, particularly comic books and telenova soap operas. They also detail the cultural growth and development of this nation. Of course, the great historical figures are also given close attention: Montezuma, the great Aztec leader; Hernï¿½n Cortï¿½s, the conquistador who brought down the Aztec empire; Malinche, Cortï¿½s' Indian mistress and interpreter; and Pancho Villa, who led the 1910 Mexican Revolution. Artistically, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, David Siqueiros, and Josï¿½ Orozco are cited, as are writers such as Sor Juana Inï¿½s de la Cruz, Octavio Paz, and Carlos Fuentes. This is a comprehensive guide to a rich and varied country. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p><br>William H.

Relationships between women can be especially enriching, but when conflict arises, they also can be especially damaging. Too many women approach conflict as if they were unbelievers-with gossip, spiteful actions, bitterness, and even hatred. <br><br>In <i>Peacemaking Women</i>, Tara Klena Barthel and Judy Dabler offer a meaningful, lasting message to lead women out of conflict to a state of peace where they can live as representatives of Christ to one another and well as unbelievers. With advice that is firmly rooted in Scripture, the authors bring sound, practical help for women who want to know what the Bible says about conflict resolution and how to achieve peace in their relationships with God, self, and others.</p><p>Organized into twelve chapters covering conflicts with God, others, and within, Peacemaking Women provides discussion questions and recommended resources at the end of each chapter to help individuals and groups apply the biblical principles."This book tells the truth. The authors know the struggles of women and they offer hope rooted in God's Word to transform conflict into grace in lives, families, churches, and communities." <p>Charles W. Colson Prison Fellowship </p><p>"If I could put one book in the hands of every Christian woman, in addition to the Bible, it would be this one. The book is marked by courage, vulnerability, integrity, respect, variety, and scholarship. It is a delight to read and a joy to ponder. Reading it has been beneficial to me as I am sure it will be to many." Dr. Laura Mae Gardner Past Vice-President, Wycliffe International </p><p>"Peacemaking Women is not just for women and is not just about peacemaking. This powerfully honest book is about the peace the Gospel brings every heart that applies the truths of the Gospel to past wounds and present brokenness. And this book is about how personally embracing this Gospel of peace makes each of us a loving instrument of God's grace to others." </p><p>Bryan Chapell Covenant Seminary </p><p>"As women we know how conflict can threaten to tear apart relationships and homes. And worse yet, this conflict frequently begins within our own hearts, working its way out in demands and desires that can seem overwhelming. Peacemaking Women isn&#x2019;t just another book on communication or conflict resolution. It will open your eyes to the role our idolatrous hearts play in our conflicts and then point you back to the Peacemaker who took peacemaking so seriously He was willing to die for it. I strongly recommend it!" </p><p>Elyse Fitzpatrick Author and Speaker </p><p>"The rifts in the Christian community are legion and legendary. The breakdown between two people or in our own walk with God saps more energy for the gospel than any one factor. Whatever the cause, the tragedy is most Christians don&#x2019;t have hope for repentance, reconciliation, and restoration. This bold and compelling book by two wise Christian mediators and peacemakers is a tour de force in offering a pathway for rebuilding broken relationships. Judy and Tara live and breathe what they write and know personally and professionally the glory of fighting for peace. Their labor of love will draw you back to the one who gave his life for our peace. Take it and read with hope and courage." </p><p>Dan B. Allender Ph.D President, Mars Hill Graduate School Author, The Wounded Heart and To Be Told </p><p>"Judy Dabler and Tara Barthel weave into Peacemaking Women their wealth of wisdom and experience in counseling and conciliation. They show that conflict resolution demands more than communication techniques and negotiation strategies. Real peace (with God, others, ourselves) flourishes only when the deep drives of our hearts are captivated by the God of peace. In other words, the gospel of the crucified and risen Christ alone contains the life-changing mercy and power to heal our relationships with our Maker, each other, and our own conflicted hearts. </p><p>Real people populate these pages, not only the authors but also the women (and some men) whom they have helped find peace in the love of Jesus (and some whom they've tried to help&#x2014;their realism also admits that not everyone wants peace on God's terms). Their stories, told with refreshing humility and honestly, show how concretely practical the Bible's theology of peace is, and speak hope that God's shalom can and does invade our broken lives and relationships in sovereign grace. I learned much about women, myself, and my God and his grace from Peacemaking Women. I highly recommend it." Dennis E. Johnson, Ph.D. Academic Dean and Professor of Practical Theology Westminster Seminary California </p><p>"Living in a world of conflict, we desperately need to discover the art of peacemaking. Tara Barthel and Judy Dabler use the wisdom of their own experience to apply God's truth to the deep wounds of our lives, showing the path to intimacy with God, reconciliation with others and shalom in our hearts.

First published in 1869 and privately printed to raise funds for &#x201c;the Moses of her people,&#x201d; Sarah Bradford&#x2019;s memorable biography recalls the former slave&#x2019;s grim childhood; her perilous experiences leading slaves into Canada; her efforts as a Civil War nurse, cook, and scout for the Union Army; and her post-conflict endeavors to aid and educate former slaves.<br>An inspiring story of bravery, perseverance, and self-sacrifice, this accurate, reliable account by Tubman&#x2019;s contemporary is essential reading for students of American history and African-American studies.</p><p>Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Ross; c. 1822 &#x2013; March 10, 1913) was an African-American abolitionist, humanitarian, and during the American Civil War, a Union spy. Born into slavery, Tubman escaped and subsequently made about thirteen missions to rescue approximately seventy enslaved family and friends, using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad. She later helped John Brown recruit men for his raid on Harpers Ferry, and in the post-war era struggled for women's suffrage.</p><h2>The Jazz Guitar Chord Bible Complete</h2><p>The Jazz Guitar Chord Bible Complete solves one of the greatest problems in jazz...the knowledge and use of chords.

Are you sure it's Karl, not Groucho? How can you summarize the work of Karl Marx in cartoons? It took Rius to do it.

It is a journey happily interrupted by meetings of fellow modern animals (as well as plants, fungi and bacteria) similarly tracing their evolutionary path back through history. As each evolutionary pilgrim tells their tale, Dawkins and Wong shed light on topics such as speciation, sexual selection and extinction.</p><p>Written with unparalleled wit, clarity and intelligence; taking in new scientific discoveries of the past decade; and including new 'tales', illustrations and fractal diagrams, THE ANCESTOR'S TALE shows us how remarkable we are, how astonishing our history, and how intimate our relationship with the rest of the living world.</p></p><p><p><strong>Richard Dawkins</strong>is an evolutionary biologist renowned throughout the world.

Dinosaurs are in the news every day, as well as viewed in museums and on science channels. Unfortunately, these portrayals always push an evolutionary agenda. This book counters those arguments with solid, accurate, and biblically-based science: </p><ul> <li>Explains the latest findings in dinosaur biology, behavior, extinction, and more</li> <li>Covers the complete spectrum of dinosaur-related topics, from the earliest dinosaur discoveries to debate over why they went extinct</li> <li>Provides a visually stunning, dynamic exploration into the history of dinosaurs through the most current discoveries few have seen before!</li> </ul> <p> Because of secular books and television shows, many Christians struggle to explain how dinosaurs fit in the biblical timeline. The word &#x201c;dinosaur&#x201d; is not found in the Bible, causing some well-meaning Christians to turn to secular science for an explanation, including more speculation than actual fact. Unfortunately, this misdirection has caused many people to lose faith in the Bible, especially the young generation. This book will restore faith in the Word of God as it connects the Bible with science.

Against a backdrop of red leaves and drifting snowflakes, a large and endearing molasses-colored bear, defined by sturdy dark brown lines, strides across the page. His journey continues through the opening spreads: it is obvious that this creature knows exactly where he is heading. By the time the story actually begins, Old Bear has found his den and lies sound asleep, oblivious to the swirl of winter around him. Dreams comfort him: once more a cub and surrounded by the colors of spring, he naps in a giant pink crocus. His dreams turn to summer where a daisy sun shines in the sky, leaves appear as butterflies, and clouds rain tasty blueberries. Old Bear dreams on through the seasons. Then, one day he awakens, stretches, and heads out into the real world where he is met with flowering trees, butterflies and tulips, and a glistening lake. Now, Old Bear is part of the wonder. As he did in <i>Kitten's First Full Moon</i>, Henkes has created a thoroughly delightful character filled with curiosity and sweetness and placed him in a simple tale that unfolds with a natural, rhythmical pace. And to fill out his cyclical story, the artist provides autumnal front endpapers and contrasting vernal back endpapers. Opportunities to introduce the seasons, colors, and animal hibernation abound. <i>Old Bear</i> will enrapture young listeners for years to come.&#x2014;<i>Barbara Elleman, Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, Amherst, MA</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(Gabriel Campanario <i>The Seattle Times</i>)</p><h2>Donnie Brasco</h2><p>When FBI Special Agent Joe Pistone began a six-month&#x201d; operation infiltrating New York's Bonanno crime family in 1975, he had no idea what was about to happen. Posing as jewel thief Donnie Brasco,&#x201d; Pistone spent the next six years undercover in the Family, witnessing-and sometimes participating in-the Mafia's gruesome activities while gathering enough evidence to send over 200 gangsters to jail. Pistone told his story in the 1988 book <i>Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia</i>-a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller and later a feature film starring Johnny Depp and Al Pacino. But because of pending trials at the time of publication, many details of the alleged crimes were held back. Now, in <i>Donnie Brasco: Unfinished Business</i>, Pistone for the first time reveals with great detail the horrific deeds of wiseguys Tony Mirra, Lefty&#x201d; Ruggiero, Sonny Black, and the rest of the cold-blooded Bonanno crew. Pistone puts the operation into historical perspective, detailing the timeline of Mafia trials that crippled the New York City crime family over the past 25 years. He also recounts his experiences after the operation, his time on the Hollywood set with Pacino and Depp, and other undercover operations through present-day. A tense, thrilling account of the greatest infiltration ever by a federal agent into the most brutal gang of killers in the world, <i>Donnie Brasco: Unfinished Business</i> is the final chapter in the story of a real American hero.</p><p>Joseph D. Pistone is the legendary FBI Special Agent who put his life on the line to infiltrate the U.S. Mafia for six years, resulting in the convictions of over 200 mobsters. He lives in an undisclosed location.Readers who don't know <i>Donnie Brasco</i>, either the book or the movie, which detailed how young Pistone managed to float in the sewer of Mafia scum, won't get what <i>Unfinished Business</i> is all about. But those who remember <i>rasco</i> will be eager to know the rest of the story, 20 years after Pistone/Brasco recounted how he infiltrated the New York Mafia and how his testimony led to a series of investigations that emasculated the five New York families. The rationalization for this follow-up volume is that, now that the trials have come to fruition, Pistone can tell <i>more </i>about how he worked undercover and how he testified. There's a great deal of filler here (we don't really need to know about what a nice guy Johnny Depp was on the set of the movie <i>Donnie Brasco</i>), but there is also enough deep background about working undercover, enough truly hair-raising reminiscences of close calls, and enough reflection on how far an undercover agent submerges himself before losing a moral compass to make this worthwhile reading--providing you're a fan of the first <i>Donnie Brasco</i>. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

This edition is annotated and illustrated by the editor/publisher.</p><p>As mentioned in his memoirs, Cheiro acquired his expertise in India. As a teenager, he traveled to the Bombay port of Apollo Bunder. There, he met his Guru, an Indian Brahmin, who took him to his village in the valley of the Konkan region of Maharashtra. Later Cheiro was permitted by Brahmans to study an ancient book that has many studies on hands; the pages of the book were made of human skin and written with gold and it is still guarded and protected with great care. After studying thoroughly for two years, he returned to London and started his career as a palmist. Cheiro had a wide following of famous European and American clients during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He read palms and told the fortunes of famous celebrities like Mark Twain, W. T. Stead, Sarah Bernhardt, Mata Hari, Oscar Wilde, Grover Cleveland, Thomas Edison, the Prince of Wales, General Kitchener, William Ewart Gladstone, and Joseph Chamberlain. He documented his sittings with these clients by asking them to sign a guest book he kept for the purpose, in which he encouraged them to comment on their experiences as subjects of his character analyses and predictions. Of the Prince of Wales, he wrote that &#34;I would not be surprised if he did not give up everything, including his right to be crowned, for the woman he loved.&#34; Cheiro also predicted that the Jews would return to Palestine and the country would again be called Israel. In his own autobiographical book, Cheiro&#39;s Memoirs: The Reminiscences of a Society Palmist, he included accounts of his interviews with King Edward VII, William Gladstone, Charles Stewart Parnell, Henry Morton Stanley, Sarah Bernhardt, Oscar Wilde, Professor Max Muller, Blanche Roosevelt, the Comte de Paris, Joseph Chamberlain, Lord Russell of Killowen, Robert Ingersoll, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Lillie Langtry, W.

ERNST CHLADNI&#39;S SOUND EXPERIMENTS Elementary Science - Sound and Sound Waves What if your science experiments were so interesting that even an Emperor wanted to know more? In 1806, scientist Ernst Chladni (KLOD-nee) left Germany for a three-year road trip, entertaining Europeans with his science. He made wires, columns of air, and solids vibrate. He wrote about this in his native German language, but his French scientist friends wanted to read about it in French. How could he get the cash he needed to write his new book? In February, 1809, Chladni&#39;s friends took him to the Tuliere Palace. This elementary science picture book dramatizes the exciting meeting between a German scientist and French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Like Bill Nye, the Science Guy today, Chladni popularized science. But during his work as an entertainer, he struggled to find the time and finances do actual research. This story provides a glimpse at the life of Ernst Chladni, the Father of Acoustics. It&#39;s an amazing example of how scientists collaborate internationally. The story is based on Chladni&#39;s own description of the event.</p><p>Children&#39;s book author Darcy Pattison finds inspiration in writing about science, nature and history; three of her books have been honored asNSTA Outstanding Science Trade Books.

Chaldni was the first scientist to discover and describe the patterns called sound waves which are characteristics of how sound travels. <br><br>"CLANG" is both <b>witty, factual, and charmingly illustrated</b> with humorous colored illustrations. A number of funny incidents in the career of Chaldni are interwoven into the story of acoustics' properties as discovered and described by Chaldni. Begun in 1809, Chaldni's great <i>"Treatment of Acoustics"</i> is a miraculous true story that involves international cooperation of scientists and diplomats to investigate the truth about sound. <br><br><b>2019 National Science Teacher's Association Outstanding Science Trade Book : </b><i><b>"A sound representation of sound! Takes the, sometimes hard to grasp, concept of sound and sound waves and makes it fun to learn."</b></i><i><b></b></i><br>From School Library Journal Gr3-6--Pattison and Willis introduce Ernst Chladni, aka the Father of Acoustics, to young children through an engaging narrative and colorful cartoon illustrations. Chladni was a German scientist who traveled Europe entertaining people by explaining and demonstrating the science of sound in the early 1800s. The meeting between Chladni and Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte is the main focus of this telling. Willis's charming artwork provides realistic representations of Chladni's inventions while staying true to the fun cartoon style of the rest of the story.&nbsp; Pattison includes German and French words, acknowledging the language barrier that the scientist faced when describing his research on the science of sound. Included in the back matter is more information about Chladni's instruments, his life, and additional historical context. The book can be utilized in the classroom for a variety of curriculum connections from history and science to music. Pattison's and Willis's early collaboration Burn: Michael Faraday's Candle is an equally enjoyable read.

Instilling a spirit of cooperation in children is the real secret to providing the gift of a happy childhood, being a "good" parent, and building the family you've always wanted.</p><p>In <i>Raising Cooperative Kids</i>, research psychologists Marion Forgatch and Gerald Patterson, one of the original developers of Time Out, provide parenting techniques that tap deep-rooted human instincts, making them universal and easy to use no matter where you live or how your family is structured. Developed over 40 years of practice and tested in clinical and prevention trials, these skills empower parents to teach their children new behaviors, change unwanted behaviors, and reduce family conflicts. Together, Forgatch, Patterson, and Friend give parents the formula to overcome family struggles and inspire children to cooperate--from toddlerhood into their teens.</p><p>Specific guidance is included for issues ranging from how to share the bathroom during the morning rush to what to do when a child misbehaves.

Having observed thousands of parents and their children over the course of almost 50 years, the authors conclude that successful families share a spirit of cooperation that generates harmonious teamwork. They codify a set of simple, sequential, easy-to-follow strategies for parents of children from toddlerhood through the tween years. Changing established unwanted behaviors is tougher than teaching new ones, but here is a skill repertoire, presented throughout the 10 chapters, which parents can use with confidence. These skills include setting clear parental directions, encouraging good behavior with a reward system, using structured family meetings for problem-solving, and creating productive routines and learning environments. Finally, chapter 10 urges parents to present a united front. In sum, the authors tell parents how to identify their strengths and weaknesses and effectively teach and lead their kids.

That transition is the basis of this book. In From Science to God, he blends physics, psychology, and philosophy to reach a new worldview in which consciousness is a fundamental quality of creation. Russell shows how all the ingredients for this worldview are in place; it remains only to put the pieces together and explore the new picture of reality that emerges. Integrating a deep knowledge of science with his own experiences of meditation, Russell arrives at a universe similar to that described by many mystics &#x2014; one in which the inner and outer worlds no longer conflict. The bridge between them, he shows, is light, and this book invites readers to cross that bridge to find new meaning in God and a deeper significance in spiritual practice.</p><p>Peter Russell, the widely acclaimed author of the bestseller The Global Brain and other pioneering works, earned an honors degree in theoretical physics and experimental psychology and a master degree in computer science at the University of Cambridge, England. Increasingly fascinated by the nature of human consciousness, he went to India to explore meditation and Eastern philosophy. Since then his primary focus has been the exploration and development of consciousness, and he&#39;s been a consultant to major corporations on managing change, creativity, and personal development. In this, his tenth book, he brings together thirty years of study laying the seeds for a revolution in consciousness.Introduction <p>It was the Spring of 1996; I had been invited to a small seminar, deep<br>in the Californian redwoods, to discuss the evolution of<br>consciousness. As I sat there, listening to various debates about the<br>nature of mind, recent discoveries in neurochemistry, and theories on<br>the origins of consciousness, I felt an increasing frustration. I<br>wanted to say, "We've got it all backwards", or words to that<br>effect. But I couldn't express my misgivings in a coherent,<br>well-reasoned manner-which you need to do in those settings if you<br>want people to take you seriously. So I bit my lip and sat with my<br>frustration. </p><p>A few weeks later, on a plane from Los Angeles to San Francisco, I<br>opened a book I had recently picked up in a used-book store. The<br>author, a Dutchman writing in the 1920's, was not saying anything that<br>was new to me, but he did remind me of the processes of perception and<br>the way we construct our experience of reality. My readings in<br>philosophy, particularly the writings of Immanuel Kant, came flooding<br>back; so did my studies in physics on the nature of light, and my<br>explorations into Eastern philosophy and meditation. Suddenly the root<br>of my frustration became clear. We need more than a new theory of<br>consciousness. We must reconsider some of our fundamental assumptions<br>about the nature of reality. That was the bit I had been missing; that<br>was the insight that was trying to break through at the seminar. I<br>started scribbling, and by the time the plane landed, the picture was<br>clear. Our whole worldview needed to be turned inside-out. </p><p>Over the following months, I worked on an essay pulling together the<br>various pieces of a model of reality in which consciousness played a<br>primary role. In the process, I discovered that the implications were<br>even deeper than I had supposed. The new worldview not only changed<br>the way science looked at consciousness, it also led to a new view of<br>spirituality-and, most surprisingly, to a new concept of God. The<br>seeds sown on that plane flight have now grown into this book. As with<br>any exploration of such profound issues, the ideas are not complete,<br>and may never be complete. They represent my current thinking on the<br>key ingredients of a new worldview, and how consciousness could be the<br>long-awaited bridge between science and spirit. </p><p>As much as the book is a journey of ideas that starts with science and<br>arrives at God, it is also my own personal journey from a physicist<br>with little interest in spiritual matters to an explorer of<br>consciousness who now begins to appreciate what the great spiritual<br>teachings have been trying to show us for thousands of years.</p></p><h2>Goops and How to Be Them: A Manual of Manners for Polite Infants Inculcating Many Juvenile Virtues, etc.</h2><p>The Goops they lick their fingers,/And the Goops they lick their knives, /They spill their broth on the tablecloth -/Oh, they lead disgusting lives!

In Kids at Work, Emir Estrada shines a light on the surprising labor of these young workers, providing the first ethnography on the participation of Latinx children in street vending. </p><p>Drawing on dozens of interviews with children and their undocumented parents, as well as three years spent on the streets shadowing families at work, Estrada brings attention to the unique set of hardships Latinx youth experience in this occupation. She also highlights how these hardships can serve to cement family bonds, develop empathy towards parents, encourage hard work, and support children&#x2014;and their parents&#x2014;in their efforts to make a living together in the United States. Kids at Work provides a compassionate, up-close portrait of Latinx children, detailing the complexities and nuances of family relations when children help generate income for the household as they peddle the streets of LA alongside their immigrant parents.</p></p><p><b>Emir Estrada</b> is Assistant Professor of Sociology at Arizona State University."This original, thoughtful, engaging ethnography vividly captures the texture of everyday life among immigrant children and children of immigrants who work selling food in the streets of Los Angeles. In the childrens own voices, we learn about their economic contributions, their lives, and aspirations, but also from them about immigrant entrepreneurship, the complex dynamics in immigrant families, and childhood in general. Kids at Work resists facile explanations and makes an enduring contribution to the immigration scholarship. Indispensable reading for anyone interested in immigrant families." (Cecilia Menjï¿½var,co-author of Immigrant Families)<br><br>"Emir Estradas insightful ethnography reveals the complexity of the household economy of undocumented and mixed-status families in Los Angeles, from the standpoint of children who work as street vendors. Kids at Work forces a reconsideration of traditional notions of childhood, family relations, and work, by demonstrating how children with their own agency and decision-making capacity enter into mutually supportive and protective family and work arrangements with their parents to make ends meet. In the context of a highly-stratified economy and society, where race, illegality, class, and gender intersect to shape unequal life chances, Estradas ground-breaking book uncovers the central and indispensable role that children play as co-contributors to the household economy of our most vulnerable families." (Zulema Valdez,author of Entrepreneurs and the Search for the American Dream)<br><br>"Estrada balances methodological rigor with great empathylikely partially rooted in her own experiences as a teen vendorto develop a deeply insightful and nuanced analysis of the lives of immigrant children street vendors in Los Angeles. Written clearly and accessibly, the book reveals the structural context in which vending becomes necessary, while underscoring the childrens agency that allows them to find meaning in the work they do to help support their families and their own aspirations. Kids at Work will make readers not only notice, but also appreciate youth whose public labor challenges social notions of childhood in powerfully gendered and racialized ways." (Leisy J. Abrego,author of Sacrificing Families: Navigating Laws, Labor, and Love Across Borders)<br><br>"Kids at Work sheds new light on the role that children and youth play in family survival strategies in the urban commons of one of the most important immigrant metropolis of our era. This book brilliantly shows the agency of these young women and men who actively contribute to the well-being of their families. Emir Estrada has made a unique contribution to the sociology of children of immigrants, studying their lives as they work alongside their parents on the streets of Los Angeles."

But Christy wants to run and play -- and not worry about Eddie Lee tagging along. One hot summer day, though, Eddie Lee takes Christy to a secret place in the woods and teaches her that beautiful things can be found in unexpected places.<br><br>"What makes Fleming's first book so effective are the carefully selected details and authentic portrayal of the children's attitudes -- as well as Cooper's luminous art, summoning up all the enchantment of a lovely summer day and presenting Eddie Lee as believably endearing". -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, pointer review&nbsp;<br><br>"(A book) that can lead children away from harmful stereotypes and labels". -- <i>Book Links</i></p><p>Virginia Fleming is the author of the picture book&nbsp;<i>Be Good to Eddie Lee</i>.Ages 5-8. Christy begins to see and appreciate the beauty of her rural environs under the guidance of Eddie Lee, a young neighbor with Down's syndrome. At first, Christy only tolerates Eddie Lee's companionship at her mother's insistence; she would rather spend her long summer days exploring the woods with pal JimBud. But Eddie Lee persistently follows the pair and ingeniously demonstrates his superior knowledge of and sensitivity to nature. He shows Christy how to catch a salamander, where to find frog eggs and a hidden lake of water lilies, and, most importantly, when to leave creatures undisturbed. A single scene in which Eddie Lee and Christy compare their distorted images in a rippled pond seems unnecessarily heavy-handed, but the portrayal of Eddie Lee as a wise and independent youngster easily overcomes this flaw. Impressionistic oil wash paintings fairly glow with the sunshine that filters through the wooded scenes, a technique that also softens the features of Eddie Lee and his friends, diminishing their physical differences. This title will undoubtedly be valued for its Down's syndrome theme, but detailed references to the pyracantha bush, the belted kingfisher, and the "beaver-gnawed birches," supported by Cooper's luminous paintings, also recommend it as a nature story. <i>Elizabeth Bush</i></p><h2>The Sisters Cafï¿½: A Novel</h2><p><p>Cathy Andrew's biological clock has passed the ticking stage and is dangerously close to "blown plumb up."

The rapturous idealizations of William Blake&#x2019;s &#x201c;echoing green&#x201d; and William Wordsworth&#x2019;s &#x201c;splendour in the grass&#x201d; stand in vivid contrast to the obliterating greenery on human battlefields in war poems such as John McCrae&#x2019;s &#x201c;In Flanders Fields&#x201d; and Carl Sandburg&#x2019;s &#x201c;Grass,&#x201d; or to the work of contemporary poets&#x2014;Lucia Perillo, Harryette Mullen, Denise Levertov, and Gary Soto among them&#x2014;who reflect on an age of environmental crisis. Here is a rich array of poets from around the world, including Virgil, T&#x2019;ao Ch&#x2019;ien, Bash&#x14d;, Andrew Marvell, Robert Burns, Victor Hugo, Christina Rossetti, Rainer Maria Rilke, Anna Akhmatova, Willa Cather, Ingeborg Bachmann, Ted Hughes, Seamus Heaney, Tomas Transtrï¿½mer, Sherman Alexie, and Derek Walcott, in a dazzling celebration of our complicated relationship to nature.</p><p><b>CECILY PARKS</b> is an award-winning poet and scholar, author of three books of poetry, and Assistant Professor in the MFA program at Texas State University.</p><h2>Interviews With History and Power</h2><p>A posthumous compilation of this award-winning and best-selling writer and journalist&#x2019;s seminal, historic interviews. Oriana Fallaci was granted access to countless world leaders and politicians throughout her remarkable career. Considering herself a writer rather than a journalist, she was never shy about sharing her opinions of her interview subjects. Her most memorable interviews&#x2014;some translated into English for the first time&#x2014;appear in this collection, including those with Ariel Sharon, Yassir Arafat, the former Shah of Iran, Lech Walesa, the Dalai Lama, Robert Kennedy, and many others. Also featured is the famous 1972 interview in which she succeeded in getting Henry Kissinger to call Vietnam a "useless war" and to describe himself as "a cowboy." To this day he calls the Fallaci interview "the most disastrous conversation I ever had with the press."</p><p><b>Oriana Fallaci</b> (1929&#x2013;2006) is the author of numerous acclaimed books, including <i>Letter to a Child Never Born</i> (1975), <i>A Man</i> (1979), <i>Inshallah</i> (1990), and the trilogy consisting of <i>The Rage and The Pride</i> (2001), <i>The Force of Reason</i> (2004), and <i>Fallaci Interviews Herself</i> (2004).</p><h2>What Adam Smith Knew: Moral Lessons on Capitalism from Its Greatest Champions and Fiercest Opponents</h2><p>What exactly is capitalism, and why do its advocates support it? What are the main objections to capitalism that have been raised by its critics? Are there moral reasons to support capitalism, or to oppose it? In this time of globalization and economic turbulence, these questions could not be more timely or more important.<br> <br>This book provides some answers through seminal readings on the nature, purpose, and effects of capitalism as understood by its most influential expositors, both historical and contemporary. In addition to Adam Smith himself, the selections gathered here include essays and excerpts by thinkers ranging from Locke and Rousseau to Hayek and Cass Sunstein. All are chosen and arranged to highlight the ways that capitalism bears on a set of fundamental human concerns: liberty, equality, social order, virtue and motivation.<br> <br>If you want to develop an informed judgment about whether markets and morality mix, this anthology is a good place to begin.<br></p><p>James R.

His middle school <i>Hard Math</i> textbook and workbook contain the materials he used while coaching many successful Mathcounts teams. They are a labor of love sold at bargain prices with the hope that they will help students around the world develop a deep understanding of middle school math and enjoy every minute of it.</p> <p>The topics align with modern middle school curricula: fractions, decimals, percents, prime factorization, plane and spatial geometry, probability, statistics, combinatorics, algebra, modular arithmetic, etc. But <i>Hard Math</i> challenges students to develop a deeper understanding: it asks much harder questions than standard texts and teaches the material and problem solving strategies students need to attack them. For example, rather than asking students to write 2/5 as a decimal, it might ask students to use the fact that 99999 = 9 ï¿½ 41 ï¿½ 271 to find the tenth digit in the decimal expansion for 1/271. (It might ask this, but never actually does.) </p> <p>The personal and somewhat irreverent prose in the IMLEM Plus edition of <i>Hard Math for Middle School</i> speaks directly to students participating in both the Intermediate Math League of Eastern Massachusetts and Mathcounts(r). The organization of the book is also designed to serve IMLEM students. But middle school math is middle school math and the book should be great for students preparing for other math contests or just looking for general enrichment or hard problems to do. </p> <p><i>Hard Math for Middle School: Workbook</i>, sold separately, contains over 100 worksheets. The worksheets have problems at different difficulty levels that students can use to solidify their understanding of the material in each section of the textbook. It would be crazy to buy this text and not also get a copy of the workbook unless your child is using this book in school or in an enrichment program that is already providing plenty of practice problems.

Surprisingly few pieces of special equipment are needed, especially for camping families. The authors emphasize the appliances and techniques that make open-hearth cooking realistic in today's homes where the fireplace is not in the kitchen. <br> The authors explain the art of building a good cooking fire and maintaining the three basic temperatures - low, medium and high - needed to prepare almost all foods, and suggest ways to keep the hearth clean and the cook safe. Each chapter on technique tells how things were done in the old days, and then goes on to demonstrate techniques for today. The authors have added substantial new material since original publication in 1982, and completely updated the resources section of the book. <br> Suzanne Goldenson and her husband are serious cooks and collectors of early American cooking implements.

The product of a lifetime of struggle and reflection, Cruse's book is a singular amalgam of cultural history, passionate disputation, and deeply considered analysis of the relationship between American blacks and American society. Reviewing black intellectual life from the Harlem Renaissance through the 1960s, Cruse discusses the legacy (and offers memorably acid-edged portraits) of figures such as Paul Robeson, Lorraine Hansberry, and James Baldwin, arguing that their work was marked by a failure to understand the specifically American character of racism in the United States. This supplies the background to Cruse's controversial critique of both integrationism and black nationalism and to his claim that black Americans will only assume a just place within American life when they develop their own distinctive centers of cultural and economic influence. For Cruse's most important accomplishment may well be his rejection of the clich?s of the melting pot in favor of a vision of Americanness as an arena of necessary and vital contention, an open and ongoing struggle.</p><p>"[T]he most imaginatively documented and politically sophisticated working prospectus on the built-in contradictions and disjunctions of the Negro Revolution."&#x2014;Albert Murray"When all the manifestoes and polemics of the Sixties are forgotten, this book will survive as a monument of historical analysis&#x2014;a notable contribution to the understanding of the American past, but more than that, a vindication of historical analsis as the best way, maybe the only way, of gaining a clear understanding of social issues."&#x2014;Christopher Lasch, New York Review of Books</p><h2>The Heart of Torah, Volume 2: Essays on the Weekly Torah Portion: Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy (Volume 2)</h2><p><p>In <i>The Heart of Torah</i><i>,</i> Rabbi Shai Held&#x2019;s Torah essays&#x2014;two for each weekly portion&#x2014;open new horizons in Jewish biblical commentary.<br><br> Held probes the portions in bold, original, and provocative ways.

What interests me first about these stores is what titles are being displayed in the 'Staff Recommends' section of the store. It is here that you can find treasured, beloved books quite dear to someone who works in the stores, someone waiting quite eagerly for the chance to hand sell their recommended titles.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in these Staff Recommend sections that I kept on seeing our Penman's titles, HERE BE DRAGONS, FALLS THE SHADOW, THE RECKONING and also SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR and WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT.<br>It's funny, you can sell something for years before you notice that the author has been quietly making a powerful impact on people everywhere.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started with HERE BE DRAGONS and I have never looked back. Her trilogy of the decline of the Welsh kings ( DRAGON, FALLS THE SHADOW and THE RECKONING)is a holiday gift I give year after year, and I'm happy to say they have always been embraced and loved. From my 15 year old niece to my 70 year old mother and many ages in between, all readers are enchanted and transported to a land and an age gone forever. But Penman makes them live forever in our minds and hearts with fantastic, unforgettable characters and wonderful history. HERE BE DRAGONS is such a great title--medieval mapmakes would write those words across any part of the map that was unknown.. a wonderful metaphor for how little the Welsh and English knew of each other.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR--Warning: This is not Shakespeare's Richard III. In this novel, Richard is a victim of circumstance and man vilified by the Tudors, but here presented as a decent and normal man, a man of conscience.<br>AND he is not a murderer. Yes, those princes did die, but not by Richard's hand.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT<p>Another wonderful title, for it refers to the 15 years of England's darkest time-the civil war between the cousins Queen Maud and King Steven.

Gilder</b> is one of the most famous economic books of all time and has sold more than one million copies since its first release. In this influential classic, Gilder explains and makes the case for supply-side economics, proves the moral superiority of free-market capitalism, and shows why supply-side economics are more effective at decreasing poverty than government-regulated markets.<br> <br> Now, in this new and completely updated edition of Wealth and Poverty, Gilder compares America&#x2019;s current economic challenges with her past economic problems&#x2013;particularly those of the late 1970s&#x2013;and explains why Obama&#x2019;s big-government, redistributive policies are doing more harm than good for the poor.<br> <br> Making the case that supply-side economics and free market policies are&#x2013;and always will be&#x2013;the answer to decreasing America&#x2019;s poverty rate and increasing her prosperity, <i>Wealth &amp; Poverty</i> offers solutions to America&#x2019;s current economic problems and hope to those who fear that our best days are behind us.</p><p><b>Capitalism Endures</b><br><p><br>When George Gilder first published <i>Wealth &amp; Poverty</i> in 1981, the book was an instant classic, becoming the economics bible of the unfolding Reagan revolution. Not since the Gilded Age of the late 1800&#x2019;s has anyone advanced so enthusiastic an endorsement of capitalism and capitalists,&#x201d; observed the <i>New York Times</i>.<br><br>Now, amid the Obama administration&#x2019;s redistributionist zeal, industrial planning schemes, vandalistic energy policies, demonization of wealth-creating entrepreneurs, and Keynesian spending programs, Gilder returns to the fray with an updated edition of his famous tome.<br>Thirty years after his paean to free enterprise shocked the Washington establishment, have the collapse of Enron, the economic meltdown of 2008, the advent of the Occupy Wall Street movement, and other events caused Gilder to reassess his devotion to capitalism? In a way, they have. As Gilder states in this edition, It is clear that we, the original supply siders, bear some responsibility for the failure to persuade. All these years later, it has become clear that we were not radical enough.&#x201d; <br><br>Dissatisfied with half-hearted defenses of capitalism as the least bad system available, <i>Wealth &amp; Poverty</i> passionately extols the morality, compassion, and efficacy of free enterprise. Buoyed by the collapse of communism but disturbed by the return of socialism under new guises, Gilder argues in a new prologue and epilogue that the solution to America&#x2019;s current economic troubles cannot be found in warmed-over socialism, but in the generosity and economic vitality that can only be unleashed by the free market.<br><br>As President Obama&#x2019;s policies lend Gilder&#x2019;s arguments a shocking new relevancy, Gilder reminds us why the New Yorker called him a scourge of feminists, unrepentant supply-sider, and now a technology prophet.&#x201d; Featuring a new foreword by Steve Forbes, this edition of <i>Wealth &amp; Poverty</i> informs us that free enterprise is the core of freedom and that nations which forget or ignore that historical lesson will not and cannot prosper.<br></p><b>From the New Prologue</b><br><p><br>The United States over the last decade has witnessed a classic confrontation between the forces of entrepreneurial capitalism and those of established institutions claiming a higher virtue, expertise, and political standing. One side subsists on unforced profits of enterprise; the other on rents and tolls and privileges at the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the White House.<br><br>&amp;hellp;The wealth of America is not an inventory of goods; it is an organic living entity, a fragile pulsing fabric of ideas, expectations, loyalties, moral commitments, and visions. To vivisect it for redistribution is to kill it. As President Mitterand&#x2019;s French technocrats discovered in the 1980s, and President Obama&#x2019;s quixotic American ecocrats are discovering today, government managers of complex systems of wealth soon find they are administering an industrial corpse, a socialized Solyndra.<br></p></p><h2>Trust: The Social Virtues and The Creation of Prosperity</h2><p>In his bestselling <i>The End of History and the Last Man,</i> Francis Fukuyama argued that the end of the Cold War would also mean the beginning of a struggle for position in the rapidly emerging order of 21st-century capitalism. In <i>Trust,</i> a penetrating assessment of the emerging global economic order "after History," he explains the social principles of economic life and tells us what we need to know to win the coming struggle for world dominance. <br> Challenging orthodoxies of both the left and right, Fukuyama examines a wide range of national cultures in order to divine the underlying principles that foster social and economic prosperity. Insisting that we cannot divorce economic life from cultural life, he contends that in an era when social capital may be as important as physical capital, only those societies with a high degree of social trust will be able to create the flexible, large-scale business organizations that are needed to compete in the new global economy. <br> A brilliant study of the interconnectedness of economic life with cultural life, <i>Trust</i> is also an essential antidote to the increasing drift of American culture into extreme forms of individualism, which, if unchecked, will have dire consequences for the nation's economic health.</p><p>Francis Fukuyama, a senior social scientist at the Rand Corporation, lives in McLean, Virginia.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b><i>On the Human Situation at the End of History</i></b><br><br>As we approach the twenty-first century, a remarkable convergence of political and economic institutions has taken place around the world. Earlier in this century, deep ideological cleavages divided the world's societies. Monarchy, fascism, liberal democracy, and communism were bitter competitors for political supremacy, while different countries chose the divergent economic paths of protectionism, corporatism, the free market, and socialist centralized planning. Today virtually all advanced countries have adopted, or are trying to adopt, liberal democratic political institutions, and a great number have simultaneously moved in the direction of market-oriented economies and integration into the global capitalist division of labor.<br><br>As I have argued elsewhere, this movement constitutes an "end of history," in the Marxist-Hegelian sense of History as a broad evolution of human societies advancing toward a final goal. As modern technology unfolds, it shapes national economies in a coherent fashion, interlocking them in a vast global economy The increasing complexity and information intensity of modern life at the same time renders centralized economic planning extremely difficult. The enormous prosperity created by technology-driven capitalism, in turn, serves as an incubator for a liberal regime of universal and equal rights, in which the struggle for recognition of human dignity culminates. While many countries have had trouble creating the institutions of democracy and free markets, and others, especially in parts of the former communist world, have slid backward into fascism or anarchy, the world's advanced countries have no alternative model of political and economic organization other than democratic capitalism to which they can aspire.<br><br>This convergence of institutions around the model of democratic capitalism, however, has not meant an end to society's challenges. Within a given institutional framework, societies can be richer or poorer, or have more or less satisfying social and spiritual lives. But a corollary to the convergence of institutions at the "end of history" is the widespread acknowledgment that in postindustrial societies, further improvements cannot be achieved through ambitious social engineering. We no longer have realistic hopes that we can create a "great society" through large government programs. The Clinton administration's difficulties in promoting health care reform in 1994 indicated that Americans remained skeptical about the workability of large-scale government management of an important sector of their economy. In Europe, almost no one argues that the continent's major concerns today, such as a high continuing rate of unemployment or immigration, can be fixed through expansion of the welfare state. If anything, the reform agenda consists of cutting back the welfare state to make European industry more competitive on a global basis. Even Keynesian deficit spending, once widely used by industrial democracies after the Great Depression to manage the business cycle, is today regarded by most economists as self-defeating in the long run. These days, the highest ambition of most governments in their macroeconomic policy is to do no harm, by ensuring a stable money supply and controlling large budget deficits.<br><br>Today, having abandoned the promise of social engineering, virtually all serious observers understand that liberal political and economic institutions depend on a healthy and dynamic civil society for their vitality. "Civil society" -- a complex welter of intermediate institutions, including businesses, voluntary associations, educational institutions, clubs, unions, media, charities, and churches -- builds, in turn, on the family, the primary instrument by which people are socialized into their culture and given the skills that allow them to live in broader society and through which the values and knowledge of that society are transmitted across the generations.<br><br>A strong and stable family structure and durable social institutions cannot be legislated into existence the way a government can create a central bank or an army. A thriving civil society depends on a people's habits, customs, and ethics -- attributes that can be shaped only indirectly through conscious political action and must otherwise be nourished through an increased awareness and respect for culture.<br><br>Beyond the boundaries of specific nations, this heightened significance of culture extends into the realms of the global economy and international order. Indeed, one of the ironies of the convergence of larger institutions since the end of the cold war is that people around the world are now even more conscious of the cultural differences that separate them. For example, over the past decade, Americans have become much more aware of the fact that Japan, an erstwhile member of the "free world" during the cold war, practices both democracy and capitalism according to a different set of cultural norms than does the United States. These differences have led to considerable friction at times, as when the members of a Japanese business network known as a <i>keiretsu</i> buy from one another rather than from a foreign company that might offer better price or quality. For their part, many Asians are troubled by certain aspects of American culture, such as its litigiousness and the readiness of Americans to insist upon their individual rights at the expense of the greater good. Increasingly, Asians point to superior aspects of their own cultural inheritance, such as deference to authority, emphasis on education, and family values, as sources of social vitality.<br><br>The increasing salience of culture in the global order is such that Samuel Huntington has argued that the world is moving into a period of "civilizational clash," in which the primary identification of people will not be ideological, as during the cold war, but cultural. Accordingly, conflict is likely to arise not among fascism, socialism, and democracy but among the world's major cultural groups: Western, Islamic, Confucian, Japanese, Hindu, and so on.<br><br>Huntington is clearly correct that cultural differences will loom larger from now on and that all societies will have to pay more attention to culture as they deal not only with internal problems but with the outside world. Where Huntington's argument is less convincing, however, is that cultural differences will necessarily be the source of conflict. On the contrary, the rivalry arising from the interaction of different cultures can frequently lead to creative change, and there are numerous cases of such cultural cross-stimulation. Japan's confrontation with Western culture after the arrival of Commodore Perry's "black ships" in 1853 paved the way for the Meiji Restoration and Japan's subsequent industrialization. In the past generation, techniques like lean manufacturing -- the process of eliminating buffers from the manufacturing process to facilitate feedback from the factory floor -- have made their way from Japan to the United States, to the latter's benefit. Whether the confrontation of cultures leads to conflict or to adaptation and progress, it is now vitally important to develop a deeper understanding of what makes these cultures distinctive and functional, since the issues surrounding international competition, political and economic, increasingly will be cast in cultural terms.<br><br>Perhaps the most crucial area of modern life in which culture exercises a direct influence on domestic well-being and international order is the economy. Although economic activity is inextricably linked with social and political life, there is a mistaken tendency, encouraged by contemporary economic discourse, to regard the economy as a facet of life with its own laws, separate from the rest of society. Seen this way, the economy is a realm in which individuals come together only to satisfy their selfish needs and desires before retreating back into their "real" social lives. But in any modern society, the economy constitutes one of the most fundamental and dynamic arenas of human sociability. There is scarcely any form of economic activity, from running a dry-cleaning business to fabricating large-scale integrated circuits, that does not require the social collaboration of human beings. And while people work in organizations to satisfy their individual needs, the workplace also draws people out of their private lives and connects them to a wider social world. That connectedness is not just a means to the end of earning a paycheck but an important end of human life itself. For just as people are selfish, a side of the human personality craves being part of larger communities. Human beings feel an acute sense of unease -- what Emile Durkheim labeled <i>anomie</i> -- in the absence of norms and rules binding them to others, an unease that the modern workplace serves to moderate and overcome.<br><br>The satisfaction we derive from being connected to others in the workplace grows out of a fundamental human desire for recognition. As I argued in <i>The End of History and the Last Man,</i> every human being seeks to have his or her dignity recognized (i.e., evaluated at its proper worth) by other human beings. Indeed, this drive is so deep and fundamental that it is one of the chief motors of the entire human historical process. In earlier periods, this desire for recognition played itself out in the military arena as kings and princes fought bloody battles with one another for primacy. In modern times, this struggle for recognition has shifted from the military to the economic realm, where it has the socially beneficial effect of creating rather than destroying wealth. Beyond subsistence levels, economic activity is frequently undertaken for the sake of recognition rather than merely as a means of satisfying natural material needs. The latter are, as Adam Smith pointed out, few in number and relatively easily satisfied. Work and money are much more important as sources of identity, status, and dignity, whether one has created a multinational media empire or been promoted to foreman. This kind of recognition cannot be achieved by individuals; it can come about only in a social context.<br><br>Thus, economic activity represents a crucial part of social life and is knit together by a wide variety of norms, rules, moral obligations, and other habits that together shape the society. As this book will show, one of the most important lessons we can learn from an examination of economic life is that a nation's well-being, as well as its ability to compete, is conditioned by a single, pervasive cultural characteristic: the level of trust inherent in the society.<br><br>Consider the following vignettes from twentieth-century economic life:<br><br>* During the oil crisis of the early 1970s, two automakers on opposite sides of the world, Mazda and Daimler-Benz (maker of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars), were both hit with declining sales and the prospect of bankruptcy. In both cases, they were bailed out by a coalition of companies with which they had traditionally done business, led by a large bank: Sumitomo Trust, in the instances of Mazda, and the Deutsche Bank, in the case of Daimler. In both cases, immediate profitability was sacrificed for the sake of saving the institution -- in the German case, to prevent it from being bought out by a group of Arab investors.<br><br>* The recession of 1983-1984 that ravaged America's industrial heartland also hit the Nucor Corporation very hard. Nucor had just entered the steelmaking business by building mini-mills using a new German continuous-casting technology. Its mills were built in places like Crawfordsville, Indiana, outside the traditional rust belt, and were operated by nonunionized workers, many of them former farmers. To deal with the drop in revenues, Nucor put its employees -- from the CEO to the lowliest maintenance worker -- on a two- or three-day workweek, with a corresponding cut in pay. No workers were fired, however, and when the economy and the company recovered, it enjoyed a tremendous esprit de corps that contributed to its becoming a major force in the American steel industry.<br><br>* In the Toyota Motor Company's Takaoka assembly plant, any of the thousands of assembly line workers who work there can bring the entire plant to a halt by pulling on a cord at his or her workstation. They seldom do. By contrast, workers at the great Ford auto plants like Highland Park or River Rouge -- plants that virtually defined the nature of modern industrial production for three generations -- were never trusted with this kind of power. Today, Ford workers, having adopted Japanese techniques, are trusted with similar powers, and have greater control over their workplace and machines.<br><br>* In Germany, shop foremen on the floor of a typical factory know how to do the jobs of those who work under them and frequently take their place if the need arises. The foreman can move workers from one job to another and evaluates them based on face-to-face dealings. There is great flexibility in promotion: a blue-collar worker can obtain credentials as an engineer by attending an extensive in-company training program rather than going to a university.<br><br>The common thread that runs through these four apparently unrelated vignettes is that in each case, economic actors supported one another because they believed that they formed a community based on mutual trust. The banks and suppliers that engineered the Mazda and Daimler-Benz rescues felt an obligation to support these auto companies because the latter had supported them in the past and would do so again in the future. In the German case, moreover, there was a nationalistic feeling that such an important trademark German name as Mercedes-Benz should not fall into non-German hands. Workers at Nucor were willing to accept severe cuts in their weekly pay because they believed that the managers who devised the pay cut plan were hurting as well and were committed to not laying them off. The workers at the Toyota plant were given immense power to stop the entire assembly line because management trusted them not to abuse that power, and they repaid this trust by using that power responsibly to improve the line's overall productivity. Finally, the workplace in Germany is flexible and egalitarian because workers trust their managers and fellow workers to a higher degree than in other European countries.<br><br>The community in each of these cases was a cultural one, formed not on the basis of explicit rules and regulations but out of a set of ethical habits and reciprocal moral obligations internalized by each of the community's members. These rules or habits gave members of the community grounds for trusting one another. Decisions to support the community were not based on narrow economic self-interest. The Nucor management could have decided to award themselves bonuses while laying off workers, as many other American corporations did at the time, and Sumitomo Trust and Deutsche Bank could perhaps have maximized their profits by selling off their failing assets. Solidarity within the economic community in question may have had beneficial consequences over the long run for the bottom line; certainly Nucor's workers were motivated to give their company an extra measure of effort once the recession was over, as was the German foreman whose company helped him to become an engineer. But the reason that these economic actors behaved as they did was not necessarily because they had calculated these economic consequences in advance; rather, solidarity within their economic community had become an end in itself. Each was motivated, in other words, by something broader than individual self-interest. As we will see, ...</p><h2>Abraham&#39;s Four Seeds</h2><p>Abraham's Four Seeds is a biblical examination of the presuppositions of Covenant Theology and Dispensationalism. Pastor, evangelist, and author John G. Reisinger demonstrates how a correct understanding of Abraham's seeds is key to harmonizing Scripture. He writes: <p>The following statement, if correctly understood, will help to clear up a lot of confusion: The nation of Israel was not the 'Body of Christ,' even though the Body of Christ is indeed the true 'Israel of God.' </p><p>Covenant Theology cannot accept the first part of that statement and Dispensationalism cannot accept the second part. The basic presuppositions of Covenant Theology make it mandatory that Israel be the church and be under the same covenant as the church, and the one thing a Dispensationalist must maintain is the church's present and future distinction from Israel which makes it mandatory that Israel and the church can never be under the same covenant or inherit the same blessings. What is essential to one system is anathema to the other system. </p><p>Dispensationalism cannot get Israel and the church together in any sense whatever, and Covenant Theology cannot get them apart. Dispensationalism cannot see that the church is the true Israel of God and the fulfillment of the promises that God made to Abraham and the fathers, and Covenant Theology cannot see that the church, as the Body of Christ, did not, and simply could not, exist in reality and experience until the personal advent of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost. Dispensationalism insists that Israel and the church have totally different promises and destinies (one earthly and the other heavenly), and Covenant Theology insists that Israel and the Body of Christ are equally the "same redeemed church under the same 'covenant of grace' and governed by the same identical 'canon of conduct.'" </p><p>Dispensationalism drives a wedge between the OT and the NT and never the twain shall meet as specific promise (OT) and identical fulfillment (NT); and Covenant Theology flattens the whole Bible out into one covenant where there is no real and vital distinction between either the Old and New Covenants or Israel and the church. </p><p>The Old Covenant proved one's guilt and forbade one to draw near without a perfect righteousness or an acceptable sacrifice. The New Covenant declares a believer to be both righteous and acceptable in God's sight, and it bids him come boldly without fear into the very Most Holy place that was totally closed off to all but Aaron under the Old Covenant. </p><p>The law as a legal covenant ended when the veil of the temple was rent from top to bottom, and the law as a pedagogue over the conscience was dismissed on the day of Pentecost when the 'promise of the Father' took up his abode in every believer as the personal Vicar of the ascended Lord. The giving of the Spirit is the proof of the accepted work of Christ in the heavenly tabernacle, and the 'given Spirit' indwelling the believer is the indelible assurance of our eternal acceptance by the Father. </p><p>It is the author's desire that this book would be of benefit to those who desire to understand "What does the Scripture say?" May the watchword Sola Scriptura have real meaning in the church!</p></p><p>John G. Reisinger is a noted evangelist, author, and teacher of the Word of God.

There they would stay until the first snows of October, although sometimes he would stay all winter. In the 1920s, he began spending his summers in Nova Scotia, claiming &#34;the wilderness is getting too crowded&#34;. Long wrote of his wilderness experiences in the books Ways of Wood Folk, Wilderness Ways, Wood-folk Comedies, Northern Trails, Wood Folk at School, and many others.

The talk is lively and fascinating as these leading minds grapple with age-old questions of compelling contemporary urgency. Daniel Goleman, the internationally bestselling author of <b>Emotional Intelligence</b>, provides the illuminating commentary&#x2014;and reports on the breakthrough research this historic gathering inspired.<br><br><b>Destructive Emotions<br><br></b>Buddhist philosophy tells us that all personal unhappiness and interpersonal conflict lie in the &#x201c;three poisons&#x201d;: craving, anger, and delusion. It also provides antidotes of astonishing psychological sophistication--which are now being confirmed by modern neuroscience. With new high-tech devices, scientists can peer inside the brain centers that calm the inner storms of rage and fear. They also can demonstrate that awareness-training strategies such as meditation strengthen emotional stability&#x2014;and greatly enhance our positive moods.<br><br>The distinguished panel members report these recent findings and debate an exhilarating range of other topics: What role do destructive emotions play in human evolution? Are they &#x201c;hardwired&#x201d; in our bodies? Are they universal, or does culture determine how we feel? How can we nurture the compassion that is also our birthright? We learn how practices that reduce negativity have also been shown to bolster the immune system.

Although there are no easy answers, the dialogues, which are part of a series sponsored by the Mind and Life Institute, chart an ultimately hopeful course. They are sure to spark discussion among educators, religious and political leaders, parents&#x2014;and all people who seek peace for themselves and the world.<br><i>The Mind and Life Institute </i>sponsors cross-cultural dialogues that bring together the Dalai Lama and other Buddhist scholars with Western scientists and philosophers. <i>Mind and Life VIII</i>, on which this book is based, took place in Dharamsala, India, in March 2000.</p><p><i>Destructive Emotions: How Can We Overcome Them? A Scientific Dialogue with the Dalai Lama</i> forcefully puts to rest the misconception that the realms of science and spirituality are at odds. In this extraordinary book, Daniel Goleman presents dialogues between the Dalai Lama and a small group of eminent psychologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers that probe the challenging questions: Can the worlds of science and philosophy work together to recognize destructive emotions such as hatred, craving, and delusion? If so, can they transform those feelings for the ultimate improvement of humanity? As the Dalai Lama explains, "With the ever-growing impact of science on our lives, religion and spirituality have a greater role to play in reminding us of our humanity."<p>The book's subject marks the eighth round in a series of ongoing meetings of the Mind Life Institute. The varied perspectives of science, philosophy, and Eastern and Western thought beautifully illustrate the symbiosis among the views, which are readily accessible despite their complexity. Among the book's many strengths is its organization, which allows readers to enjoy the entire five-day seminar or choose sections that are most relevant to their interests, such as "Cultivating Emotional Balance," "The Neuroscience of Emotion," "Encouraging Compassion," or "The Scientific Study of Consciousness." But the real joy is in gaining an insider's view of these extraordinary minds at work, especially that of the Dalai Lama, whose curiosity, Socratic questioning, and humor ultimately serve as the linchpin for the book's soaring intellectual discussion. <i>--Silvana Tropea</i></p>Daniel Goleman, PH.D. is also the author of the worldwide bestseller <b>Working with Emotional Intelligence </b>and is co-author of <i>Primal Leadership: Learning to Lead with Emotional Intelligence,</i> written with Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee. <br><br>Dr. Goleman received his Ph.D. from Harvard and reported on the brain and behavioral sciences for The New York Times for twelve years, where he was twice nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.

In the early 1980s, a Houston socialite turned the attention of maverick Texas congressman Charlie Wilson to the ragged band of Afghan "freedom fighters" who continued, despite overwhelming odds, to fight the Soviet invaders. Wilson, who sat on the all-powerful House Appropriations Committee, managed to procure hundreds of millions of dollars to support the mujahideen. The arms were secretly procured and distributed with the help of an out-of-favor CIA operative, Gust Avrokotos, whose working-class Greek-American background made him an anomaly among the Ivy League world of American spies. Avrakotos handpicked a staff of CIA outcasts to run his operation and, with their help, continually stretched the Agency's rules to the breaking point. Moving from the back rooms of the Capitol, to secret chambers at Langley, to arms-dealers' conventions, to the Khyber Pass, this book presents an astonishing chapter of our recent past, and the key to understanding what helped trigger the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union and ultimately led to the emergence of a brand-new foe in the form of radical Islam.</p><p>George Crile is a veteran producer for 60 Minutes. He lives in New York with his wife and family.Inspired by the courage of the under-armed mujahideen in Afghanistan in their fight against the Soviet Union in the early 1980s, colorful Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson used all his political savvy, and a compliant CIA operative, to instigate the largest covert war in U.S. history. Narrator Christopher Lane effects an even tone and pace, allowing the events of the story to propel the listener through the extraordinary highs and sickening lows of the flawed but heroic Wilson. Thankfully, Lane takes it easy on the accents and shines brightest when allowing a tinge of cynicism in his delivery. Wilson's war may have helped end the Cold War, but did it embolden the victors, bringing on the current war on terrorism? That answer is left to the listener.

Mr. Colï¿½n lived in Puerto Rico as a young boy and now resides in New City, New York, with his family.A wordless picture book celebrates the power of art and imagination. A little boy reads about Africa and then creates his own adventures with his pencils and paints. Wordless books require readers to slow down and read the pictures, and careful children will see beyond the main storyline by looking at the whole illustration. Why is the boy in bed and not outside? The inhaler and bottle of medicine on the side table are hints. But binoculars and an umbrella on the other side of the table tell them that he is not always bedridden. As he draws, he falls deeply into the rich world of his imaginary Africa. First he draws an elephant, and then he rides away on it. He paints zebras, has a sandwich for lunch, records a giraffe stampede and shares one of his many other sandwiches with the gorillas. After a hair-raising encounter with an aggressive rhino, the little artist shares his pencils and food with other primates, who return the favor and sketch him. Colï¿½n&#x2019;s signature scratched-watercolor technique adds richness and emotion to this warm story, but it&#x2019;s the framing scenes at beginning and end that really sparkle here. Simple line-and-color washes put the young man at the center of the story and help readers identify with him. Young artists, reach for your sketchbooks. (Picture book. 4-8) Author: Kirkus, May 2014 *STARRED REVIEW<br><br>Using watercolor and colored pencils, Colï¿½n has created a wordless book (based on his childhood) that speaks volumes. A boy, home for the day perhaps because of an illness, sits on his bed reading a book about Africa. He begins to draw. Five identical, intensely colored pictures of the boy with an easel, art supplies, and a pit helmet increase in size as readers begin this richly imagined day on a safari. He draws an elephant as an egret watches, and atop the elephant&#x2019;s back, the boy and bird find a herd of zebras. They pose for him as he sits on a stump. Giraffes thunder by, raising clouds of golden dust. The boy draws them, his body aslant as his eyes follow them. He draws a gorilla, who holds his helmet and shares his sandwich. He draws lions, a water buffalo, and a hippo before sighting a charging rhinoceros. Running with all his might, he barely escapes the rhino. Baboons retrieve his pencils, set up his easel, and draw him. They also eat his sandwiches as the day slides into evening. A spread poignantly captures the parting of boy and elephant. Eyes closed, he lays his head against his friend&#x2019;s side while the elephant&#x2019;s trunk gently caresses the boy&#x2019;s cheek. As six identical paintings decrease in size, the book returns to the boy&#x2019;s pale room, now strewn with drawings. The final scene shows the boy at school, holding the elephant&#x2019;s picture front and center. The pleasure the boy takes in making and sharing his art is palpable. Young artists will love this book, as will all children who know the joy of exploring their own imaginations. A must-have for every library. Author: June 2014 Source: School Library Journal, STARRED REVIEW<br><br>In Colï¿½n&#x2019;s (Baseball Is...) wordless fantasy, a boy lies on his bed, his sketchbook on the floor; he&#x2019;s lost in a large book titled Africa. As he takes up his sketchbook and begins to draw, small full-color panels of himself setting off across the African veldt sail forth from his mind like thought balloons. On the next page, he&#x2019;s entered his fantasy fully; he&#x2019;s in the African grasslands, carrying his drawing supplies and waving to a nearby elephant. After obligingly allowing its portrait to be drawn, the elephant carries the boy to meet other animals who pose for him&#x2014;zebras, giraffes, and hippos. A rhinoceros portrait ends in near-calamity; a gang of baboons draw the boy. After a tender goodbye to the elephant, another series of sunlit panels retreats into the boy&#x2019;s head as he returns to real life. Colï¿½n&#x2019;s visual signature is the use of finely combed lines to trace the contours of his figures, a technique that&#x2019;s at once delicate and sensuous. It&#x2019;s a strongly developed and executed account of a childhood fantasy, urging all young artists to dream and to draw. Ages 4&#x2013;8. Agency: Morgan Gaynin Inc. (Sept.) Author: Publishers Weekly, 6/23/14 *STARRED REVIEW<br><br>A boy in bed, asthma inhaler within reach, sketchbook at his side, looking at a book about Africa, is not confined by the walls of his room. As he begins to draw, he takes a journey. The palette changes from subdued pen-and-ink with wash in the bedroom to vibrant hues textured with scratched-in lines that seem to pulse, capturing the landscape and animals of Africa. On this wordless art safari, based on Colï¿½n&#x2019;s own childhood imaginings, first up is the elephant. This fellow is so pleased with the boy&#x2019;s portrait of him that he then accompanies the boy on his &#x201c;hunt.&#x201d; They spot a zeal of zebras (one watches as the boy creates) and a pride of lions. A charging rhinoceros is calmed when shown a sketch of himself&#x2014;made just in the nick of time! Youngsters will pore over each spread in wonder, soaking up the details. Upon his &#x201c;return,&#x201d; the traveling artist shares his pictures with his classmates. A true celebration of where our imaginations can take us. Author: Booklist, *STARRED REVIEW Source: August 1, 2014<br><br>A young artist, inspired by his books about African animals, is transported to an imaginary safari in this dreamy wordless book. Armed only with his pencil, sketch pad, and easel, this budding Leonardo finds his models in the African landscape&#x2014;an elephant, zebras, giraffes, lions, gorillas (one of whom snatches the boy&#x2019;s pith helmet and lunch)&#x2014;and all willing to pose. He has some adventures&#x2014;a rhino charges him but is quickly placated when the boy shows it (from the safe distance of a tree branch) the portrait he drew. Then a group of baboons take the boy&#x2019;s drawing implements and turn the tables by sketching him (and it&#x2019;s not a terribly flattering portrait!). Ultimately he ends up back in his own bedroom, surrounded by the books that inspired him and the sketches we saw him make on his safari. The story line is engaging and easy to follow, and, while it&#x2019;s whimsical, the majesty of the animals comes through in both the boy&#x2019;s sketches and the main illustrations. Colï¿½n&#x2019;s pen-and-ink, watercolor, colored-pencil, and lithograph pencil pictures are nicely textured and tinged with golden hues. A final illustration shows the boy sharing his artwork in a class presentation; an appended author&#x2019;s note describes Colï¿½n&#x2019;s &#x201c;aha moment&#x201d; for the book. Author: Horn Book, *STARRED REVIEW Source: Sept/Oct 2014<br><br>In this marvelous wordless adventure, Raï¿½l Colï¿½n (Abuelo) takes us on safari through a boy artist's imagination. Colï¿½n, who suffered from asthma as a child, calls to mind in pictures here what Robert Louis Stevenson's words do in "The Land of Counterpane." Colï¿½n uses his pencils to summon a safari's worth of animals. The boy artist, pictured in bed in pen-and-inks and watercolor, looks at a book about Africa, a safari hat, sketchbook and stash of pencils nearby. A sequence of full-color images in Colï¿½n's signature compositions leads us into the creations of the artist in his imagination. The two styles clearly delineate the bedbound child and his imagined self as artist on safari. The young artist appears with canteen and easel slung over his shoulders, waving to an elephant. The elephant stops to model for a portrait. You could teach an art class from observing the young artist's lines. The elephant, pleased with the results, offers the boy a ride. Zebras pause by an acacia tree for a portrait; the boy contorts himself to sketch a herd of swift-moving giraffes. He gazes at a pride of lions from a safe distance, and a gorilla grabs the boy's hat and lunch as the price for posing. The climax involves a charging rhino in a heart-stopping four-part sequence.The book closes as it opens, with a sequence that charts a poignant parting from his pachyderm friend, and a return to the boy's bedroom. One last image takes the boy from his solitary work to an appreciative audience. Bravo! --Jennifer M.

Author: Shelf Awareness, *STARRED REVIEW Source: September 23, 2014</p><h2>George Harrison: Behind The Locked Door</h2><p>Behind The Locked Door is Graeme Thomson s rich, insightful account of George Harrison s extraordinary life and career. As a Beatle, Harrison underwent a bewilderingly compressed early adulthood, buffeted by unprecedented levels of fame and success. &#34;Beatlemania&#34; offered remarkable experiences and opportunities but ultimately left him unsettled and unfulfilled. His life became a quest for deeper meaning which travelled far beyond the parameters of his former band and, indeed, music itself. This elegant, in-depth biography tracks him assiduously through his many changes and conflicts, from schoolboy guitarist to global superstar, God seeker to independent filmmaker, Formula One enthusiast to UNICEF fundraiser, and marks the perennial struggle of a man attempting to walk a spiritual path lined with temptation. Drawing on scores of new interviews with close friends and collaborators, rigorous research and critical insight, Behind The Locked Door is a fascinating account of the motives and varied achievements of an often misunderstood man. It offers full analysis of Harrison s music, including his earliest songs for The Beatles, his landmark solo album All Things Must Pass, his work with The Traveling Wilburys, and the posthumous Brainwashed, as well as his pioneering forays into Indian and electronic music. It is also an intimate character study, beautifully illustrating the eternal yin and yang of Harrison s nature.

Faced with internal tensions and the millennium-old fragmentation of Christendom, the path to a common Christian identity has been rendered all but impossible. Undaunted, Arjakovsky points to the emergence of a new concept of Orthodoxy as &#x201c;right knowing,&#x201d; a knowing that unifies what is believed with what is lived, wherever this might be. He is an acute reader of the tensions between the piously political and the truly spiritual in the troubled history of Christendom&#x2014;East as well as West. The book&#x2019;s contributions to studies in the history of Christianity, ecumenism, and sophiology offer Christian readers renewed hope in an ecumenical project uninhibited by tired tropes of division and over-rehearsed acrimony.

In this Amazon exclusive, she sat down with Susan Mallery to discuss their work. Read the resulting interview below, or turn the tables to see what happened when Susan interviewed Beth.</p> <p><strong>Beth:</strong> Okay, before we start this interview, I&#x2019;d like to take a moment to talk to you about your Christmas card this year, which featured your adorable poodle, Nikki. Dressed up in an elaborate chiffon holiday neckpiece. Featuring jingle bells and ribbon. You and I both know that this is not an isolated incident. Oh yes, I&#x2019;ve seen the photos of Miss Nikki making love to the camera in Halloween costumes and baseball jerseys. I think everyone here deserves to know the truth: does Nikki have a stylist? Or do poodles have an innate French flair for accessorizing?</p> <p><strong>Susan:</strong> Yes, Nikki actually does have a personal stylist, a friend who sends her a new outfit at least once a year. Nikki is a star. Sigh. It&#x2019;s getting to be a problem. She was born in a playpen in Albuquerque, but has grown so used to attention that she demands it. When she decides it&#x2019;s time to cuddle, nothing will deter her. She bats my hands away from the keyboard with her nose. Like everyone else who meets her, I have fallen under her spell. I&#x2019;m helpless to resist.</p> <p><strong>Beth:</strong> Who gets more fan mail--you or Nikki?</p> <p><strong>Susan:</strong> I get more, but hers tastes better.</p> <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <em>Already Home</em> is technically women&#x2019;s fiction, which means that in addition to the romance storyline, there&#x2019;s a truckload of family drama. Oh, how I love family drama. The fictional kind, I mean. Give us a few hints about the book. What&#x2019;s your favorite scene?</p> <p><strong>Susan:</strong> : The story revolves around Jenna, recently divorced and in the midst of an unexpected career change. So her life is already in a state of flux when she&#x2019;s hit with the sudden appearance of her birth parents who are, to put it mildly, nothing like Jenna&#x2019;s &#x201c;real&#x201d; (aka, adoptive) parents. Jenna was raised in a conservative Texas town by loving but traditional parents. Her birth parents are throwbacks to the 1970s, vegetarian hippies who get messages from "the Universe" and have an unnatural dislike of dairy. <br> <br> One of the scenes I love best takes place when Jenna travels with them to their home on a California vineyard. There, she meets siblings and other family, and she gets a glimpse of the life she would have lived if they hadn&#x2019;t given her up for adoption all those years ago. What I love about this scene is that this is where Jenna&#x2019;s heart begins to open. First impressions can be wrong... or at least incomplete. <br> <br> But as Jenna is getting to know her birth family, she can&#x2019;t help wondering why they seem to think they have to dive into deep family intimacy immediately. What&#x2019;s the urgency? Why can&#x2019;t they let their feelings develop over time?</p> <p><strong>Beth:</strong> Jenna, the main character in <em>Already Home</em>, has invited Amy and Linnie, the main characters from my novel <em>The Bake-Off</em>, over for a dinner party. Discussion topics will include: dysfunctional families, cooking disasters, and truly unfortunate dating choices. What is your heroine cooking, and what can my characters bring?</p> <p><strong>Susan:</strong> Jenna has discovered the joy of fusion cuisine. In the book, she experiments with Mexican-Indian fusion and comes up with a fabulous recipe for Curry Chicken Enchiladas. Served, of course, with chips and salsa and hummus and pita. As for your characters, they can bring dessert. It&#x2019;ll have to be apple pie, since they are big old bake-off frauds and that is really the only recipe they can make, right?</p> <p><strong>Beth:</strong> Well, yes. But they prefer the term &#x201c;counterfeit confectionistas&#x201d; to &#x201c;frauds,&#x201d; thank you very much. Since Jenna is a sous chef who wants to open her own cooking store, I assume you had to slog through hours of torturous research at places like Williams-Sonoma and Sur La Table. (These are the sacrifices you make for your art!) What is your favorite kitchen implement or gadget?</p> <p><strong>Susan:</strong> Two words: wine key.</p> <p><strong>Beth:</strong> If you had a reality show, what would it be called, and what would a typical episode be like?</p> <p><strong>Susan:</strong> I adore watching reality shows, and I&#x2019;m not even embarrassed to admit it. (Okay, I&#x2019;m a little embarrassed.) They&#x2019;re just so grotesque. The situations are staged, but the emotions are real, and I&#x2019;m an emotion junkie. But I would never go on a reality show because I don&#x2019;t want people to feed off of my emotions, other than in my books, of course.</p> <p><strong>Beth:</strong> I know, I know, but humor me. If you did...?</p> <p><strong>Susan:</strong> I actually do have a reality dating show in <em>Only Mine</em>, an August release in my <em>Fool&#x2019;s Gold</em> series of romance novels. It doesn&#x2019;t go well.</p> <p><strong>Beth:</strong> So in addition to being talented and witty, you&#x2019;re prolific as all get-out. How many books do you have coming out in 2011? Five? Eighteen? What gives? Have you somehow figured out how to clone yourself or survive without sleep? I demand to know your secret. And don&#x2019;t give me that song and dance about &#x201c;hard work&#x201d; and &#x201c;self-discipline.&#x201d;</p> <p><strong>Susan:</strong> I have four books coming out in 2011. <em>Already Home</em> in April, and then I&#x2019;ll continue the <em>Fool&#x2019;s Gold</em> series in August, September, and October with <em>Only Mine</em>, <em>Only Yours</em>, and <em>Only His</em>. The Hendrix triplets will all fall in love this year. <br> <br> My secret? I have the attention span of a gnat. If I don&#x2019;t write quickly, I get bored. I start thinking about the next story I want to write, and the next one after that. I don&#x2019;t lack for ideas, so I have to be disciplined about completing each one. Working on the next one is my reward for finishing the current project.</p>Dear Reader,<br><br>ALREADY HOME is one of the most emotional stories I've ever written, a story of a woman who learns to open her heart and, in the process, discovers that love doesn't wait for an invitation. Jenna Stevens is still reeling from a recent divorce and recuperating from wounds inflicted by a husband who belittled her at every opportunity. A classically trained chef, Jenna no longer believes she's capable of the leaps of creativity that once won her praise from her instructors and from food critics, so she moves back to her hometown in Texas to open a retail cooking store.<br><br>Just as Jenna's settling into her new career and beginning to feel like she's on even ground, her birth mother barrels her way into Jenna's life. Jenna doesn't want or need a second mother, especially a vegan mother named Serenity who would have named her Butterfly. But while Serenity listens to signs from the Universe, she easily ignores Jenna telling her to go away. With gentle but insistent pressure, she will find a way to open Jenna's heart.<br><br>And once the heart is open, anything can happen!<br><br>Susan Mallery</p><h2>Joy the Baker Homemade Decadence: Irresistibly Sweet, Salty, Gooey, Sticky, Fluffy, Creamy, Crunchy Treats : A Baking Book</h2><p>Joy Wilson believes that everything is better with pie.

The authors explain how what began as a theory of child development is now used to conceptualize and study nearly all aspects of social functioning across the lifespan, including mental representations of self and others, emotion regulation, personal goals and strivings, couple relationships, caregiving, sexuality, psychopathology, psychotherapy, and organizational behavior. The origins and measurement of individual differences in adult attachment are examined, as is the question of whether and how attachment patterns can change.<br><br> New to This Edition:<br> *Reflects major advances, including hundreds of new studies.<br> *Clarifies and extends the authors' influential model of attachment-system functioning.<br> *Cutting-edge content on genetics and on the neural and hormonal substrates of attachment.<br> *Increased attention to the interplay among attachment and other behavioral systems, such as caregiving and sexuality.<br> *Expanded discussion of attachment processes in counseling and psychotherapy.<br> *Additional coverage of leadership, group dynamics, and religion.</p><p>Mario Mikulincer, PhD, is Professor of Psychology and Provost of the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya in Israel.

He has also received Distinguished Career Awards from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology and the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, and an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Stockholm, Sweden."Mikulincer and Shaver provide a wonderfully comprehensive, integrative overview of a rich and broad empirical terrain. The result is a superb second edition that not only gives readers--novices and experts alike--a deeper understanding of attachment 'from the cradle to the grave,' but also suggests where new ideas and research need to head in coming years. The authors highlight several areas of research that have grown considerably since the first edition, such as how attachment theory interfaces with neuroscience, sexuality, caregiving, emotional and behavioral regulation, interpersonal regulation, personal growth, and therapeutic advances."--Jeffry A. Simpson, PhD, Distinguished University Teaching Professor and Chair, Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota<br><br> "This is just an amazing book. It is beautifully written and provides a rich synthesis of the adult attachment literature. It is extremely comprehensive but at the same time a true pleasure to read. Mikulincer and Shaver are pioneers who both played critical roles in introducing attachment to mainstream psychology and who, in the years since, have made key contributions methodologically and theoretically. In this book, they go well beyond their own work to cover the waterfront. A classic."--Mary Dozier, PhD, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of Delaware<br><br> "For more than three decades, attachment theory has been our most intellectually diverse and compelling theory of close relationships. This deeply illuminating volume is a tour de force review of contemporary theory and research. Combining insights from neuroscience, psychopathology, and developmental and social psychology, this beautifully written book offers a cutting-edge update to the first edition. Quite simply, it is indispensable."--Harry T. Reis, PhD, Department of Clinical and Social Sciences in Psychology, University of Rochester<br><br> "This exciting volume is essential reading for those interested in attachment processes. The authors outline the key principles underlying the classic studies of adult attachment; impressively, they also provide a coherent integration of the thousands of studies that have built on this research. Such key topics as emotion regulation, the neurobiology of attachment, couple dynamics, and group processes attest to the breadth and depth of attachment theory and its implications for adults&#x2019; emotional and relational lives."--Judith A. Feeney, PhD, School of Psychology, University of Queensland, Australia<br><br> "This comprehensive book is exceptionally well written by attachment theory experts. It enhances the reader's understanding of attachment theory and provides a framework for future researchers to use as a guide for scientific pursuits. This is a very useful book for advanced graduate courses focused on adult attachment, such as courses covering personality theories.

They have evolved and spread amongst us, shaping our culture through infection, disease, and pandemic. At the same time, our changing human culture has itself influenced the evolutionary path of microbes. Dorothy H. Crawford here shows that one cannot be truly understood without the other. <br><br>Beginning with a dramatic account of the SARS pandemic at the start of the 21st century, she takes us back in time to follow the interlinked history of microbes and man, taking an up-to-date look at ancient plagues and epidemics, and identifying key changes in the way humans have lived - such as our move from hunter-gatherer to farmer to city-dweller -- which made us vulnerable to microbe attack. <br><br>Showing how we live our lives today -- with increasing crowding and air travel -- puts us once again at risk, Crawford asks whether we might ever conquer microbes completely, or whether we need to take a more microbe-centric view of the world. Among the possible answers, one thing becomes clear: that for generations to come, our deadly companions will continue to shape human history.<br><br>Oxford Landmark Science books are 'must-read' classics of modern science writing which have crystallized big ideas, and shaped the way we think.<br></p><p><br>Dorothy H.

Theologically, the Social Gospel leaders were overwhelmingly post-millennialist in the sense that they believed the Second Coming could not happen until humankind had rid itself of social evils by human effort. Social Gospel leaders were predominantly associated with the Progressive Movement and most were theologically liberal, although they were typically more conservative when it came to their views on social issues. Walter Rauschenbusch was one of the leaders of this important Christian movement.</p><p>Walter Rauschenbusch (1861-1918) was a Christian theologian and Baptist minister, and a key figure in the Social Gospel movement in the United States.</p><h2>Bad Kitty: Puppy&#39;s Big Day (classic black-and-white edition)</h2><p><p>Bad Kitty's in a bad mood . . . a very bad mood, and Puppy is not helping.</p><p>Enter Uncle Murray, who's tasked with taking care of Puppy for the day, but that's when the trouble begins. When they go on a walk through the park, Uncle Murray almost gets himself arrested while Puppy ends up in the pound, where he meets some very peculiar new pals.</p></p><p><p><b>Nick Bruel</b> is the author and illustrator of the phenomenally successful Bad Kitty series, including the 2012 and 2013 CBC Children's Choice Book Award winners <i>Bad Kitty Meets the Baby </i>and <i>Bad Kitty for President.</i> Nick has also written and illustrated popular picture books including <i>Who is Melvin Bubble?</i> and <i>Bob and Otto.</i> Nick lives with his wife and daughter in Westchester, New York.</p>Gr 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;Because Bad Kitty is in a terrible mood, Uncle Murray is enlisted to get Puppy out of the house, and the two set off to spend the day together. Right away, though, they get into trouble with an offstage police officer, who tickets Uncle Murray for violations like walking a dog without a leash and failing to clean up after the pup. They then head for the dog park, where they encounter a rather aggressive bulldog named Petunia, who quickly forms a crush on Puppy. After she chases Uncle Murray up a tree, Petunia and Puppy are picked up by Animal Control and taken to a pound. By the time Puppy is claimed, he has made friends with several of the odd characters at the pound, and soft-hearted Uncle Murray ends up as a dog owner. Scattered throughout the narrative are interjections from Bad Kitty about the yuckier habits of dogs, and the end matter includes information on adopting pets from shelters. As always, Bruel's writing is hilarious, and his excellent illustrations make the story complete. Bad Kitty fans will enjoy this volume immensely.&#x2014;Sarah Reid, Broome County Public Library, Binghamton, NY</p><h2>Maisy, Charley, and the Wobbly Tooth</h2><p>On his first trip to the dentist, Charley gets lots of moral support from Maisy and friends in a full-length story readers will be eager to sink their teeth into.Maisy's friend Charley has a wobbly tooth!

When he brings a giraffe to tea, the King doesn't blink an eye and says, "Hello. How do you do?" and the Queen merely exclaims, "Well! Fancy meeting you!" The royal pair continue to invite the boy as their guest for tea, breakfast, lunch, dinner, apple pie, and Halloween, and each time he politely asks if he can bring a friend, waits for their assent, then brings a hippo, monkeys, an elephant, and once even a pride of lions into their elegant home.

Using historical research, original organizational case studies, and personal interviews, the authors illuminate how women of color have led the fight to control their own bodies and reproductive destinies. Undivided Rights shows how women of color -starting within their own Latina, African American, Native American, and Asian American communities have resisted coercion of their reproductive abilities. Projected against the backdrop of the mainstream pro-choice movement and radical right agendas, these dynamic case studies feature the groundbreaking work being done by health and reproductive rights organizations led by women-of-color.<br><br>The book details how and why these women have defined and implemented expansive reproductive health agendas that reject legalistic remedies and seek instead to address the wider needs of their communities. It stresses the urgency for innovative strategies that push beyond the traditional base and goals of the mainstream pro-choice movement strategies that are broadly inclusive while being specific, strategies that speak to all women by speaking to each woman. While the authors raise tough questions about inclusion, identity politics, and the future of women&#x2019;s organizing, they also offer a way out of the limiting focus on "choice."<br><br><i>Undivided Rights</i> articulates a holistic vision for reproductive freedom.

Compassionate, straightforward, and easy to understand, this updated edition gives readers invaluable advice about: <br><br><b>ï¿½</b> Credit cards and the new bankruptcy laws&nbsp;<br> <b>ï¿½</b> FICO scores&nbsp;<br> <b>ï¿½ </b>Changes in student financial aid&nbsp;<br> <b>ï¿½ </b>Changes in the real estate market and mortgages&nbsp;<br> <b>ï¿½ </b>Stocks and bonds&nbsp;<br> <b>ï¿½ </b>The latest retirement investment strategies, including the new Roth 401(k)&nbsp;<br> <b>ï¿½ </b>Mutual funds and annuities&nbsp;<br> <b>ï¿½ </b>Wills and trusts&nbsp;<br> <b>ï¿½ </b>Social Security&nbsp;<br> <b>ï¿½ </b>Life insurance&nbsp;<br> <b>ï¿½</b> Disability and long-term care insurance<br> <b>ï¿½</b> Identity theft (and what to do if you're a victim of it)</p><p>Suze Orman's face and name are more prominent on the cover of her new money guide than its title, <i>The Road to Wealth</i>. And why not? Orman has parlayed her popular renown as both a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and video-age financial guru into an undeniable position of respect and trust when it comes to matters of dollars and sense. This time she presents an encyclopedic guide to the various components of one's overall financial life--from managing debt and owning a home to making investments and preparing to pass it all along--and she does so in the clear and confident style to which her fans have become accustomed. "Here is what you need to know," she writes at the outset. "Answers to the questions you have been asking, as well as the questions you should have been asking, delivered in the most complete, straightforward way I know." While the concise text moves logically from "creating a strong financial foundation to amassing assets and protecting them from common mistakes and periods of economic downturn," this is not meant to be read from cover to cover. Rather, it is a ready bookshelf reference for planning and sorting out common finance concerns, like how to calculate the mortgage payment you can best afford, determine what Medicare will pay toward nursing care, decide between retirement plan options, and similar matters of personal importance. <i>--Howard Rothman</i><b>Bonus:</b> Suze Orman is giving each purchaser of <i>The Road to Wealth</i> a subscription to her bimonthly online newsletter, which offers regularly updated information on the stock and bond markets; Suze's stock and mutual fund picks; articles and projections from various economic experts; rates on money market funds, CDs, and credit cards; and all kinds of good, sound financial advice. <i>The Road to Wealth</i> and the Suze Orman E-Newsletter together are a truly interactive package and an indispensable reference tool for every financial library.</p><h2>Lesbian Couples: A Guide to Creating Healthy Relationships</h2><p>Written by two experienced lesbian therapists, <i>Lesbian Couples</i> covers a range of topics&#x2014;commitment ceremonies and marriage, living arrangements, work, money, togetherness and separate identities, coming out to family and friends, resolving conflict and understanding each other&#x2014;and uses a variety of helpful examples and problem-solving techniques, drawing from research done on lesbian couples over the past decade. The book pays special attention to differences of race, class, age and physical ability, and addresses the issues raised when one or both partners are recovering from alcohol, substance, or sexual abuse.

It's hard to keep up, to keep our balance. It's hard to keep trusting in God. And it's especially difficult when the changes we're faced with are unwanted: the death of a loved one, a child leaving home, an illness, a frustrated dream. Craig Barnes knows the dark side of change. As a pastor, he has counseled many Christians through tough times of transition. And he has been challenged by unwanted changes--interruptions--in his own life. At times it seems as though God has moved far, far away. But Barnes has discovered that just the opposite is true: during times of change and seeming abandonment, God is right at our side offering to lead us in a new direction, offering us new life. He writes, "A young widow can outlive her grief and decide her life may never be the same but is far from over. A lost job can become the beginning of a new vocation." Here is the book for all who have known disappointment, bereavement or the shattering of faith, a book all the more valuable because it promises hope without denying despair. In <em>When God Interrupts</em> a sensitive, insightful pastor shows us how we can be found by God in the middle of unwanted change.</p><p>When God Interrupts is for men and women who are not living the life they had planned. It is for those who have faced significant loss, loss that has forced them to make a frightening choice. Will they clutch at something else for their salvation? Or can they leave their hands open long enough to receive the life Jesus was dying to give them? Spouses die or depart. Friendships wither. Health fades. Children grow up and leave home. We move to new jobs and new towns. The dreams and securities of the past are shattered, hopes for the future disappointed. Nothing stays the way it was or turns out exactly as we had expected. Life, it seems, is necessarily dotted with loss, marked by abandonment. But all this should come as no surprise to Christians, those who are called to lose their lives in order to find them. So if we try to follow Jesus, we can count on a great deal of abandonment. The good - but hard - news of the gospel is that abandonment can be embraced as the opportunity to receive new life.M.

That is what I have striven to do and am doing. Rev. Denis Fahey This is the last book published before Fr. Fahey s death. It is an enduring testament to his love of the land and his firm belief that the best setting for most Catholic living is the family farm or small business, similar to the life lived by the Holy Family of Nazareth. The Church is greatly interested in farming because it is the most fundamental of all human occupations. Those who work the land are deeply immersed in, and must work in harmony with, the natural rhythms and processes of God s creative handiwork. The harmony and balance of rural life are profoundly upset by industrialized living, both on and off the land. Father delves into many spiritual, chemical, technical, and scientific questions pertaining to the future of farming and the life of the Church and all human society, which depends completely on the land for its existence and prosperity.</p><p></p><h2>Banjo Roots and Branches (Music in American Life)</h2><p>The story of the banjo&#39;s journey from Africa to the western hemisphere blends music, history, and a union of cultures.

By and large, I do believe that Kelly has mostly succeeded in this improvement." --&nbsp;Scott&nbsp;W.&nbsp;McMurray&nbsp;II<br><br>"In Kelly's model, prices tell you exactly how to adjust things so that you do buy low and sell high atgiven intervals -- and without deluding yourself that you can predictwhat the market will do." --&nbsp;David&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Deutsch<br><br>"I trade options for a living (my own account). After reading the book I am now using his strategy on a portion of my portfolio. Overall, the strategy is good for the passive investor or full time trader. If anyone is skeptical, you may like to know that I have backtested Kelly's 3% strategy versus many other strategies (Covered Calls, Selling Puts, etc) and his strategy constantly outperforms over the long run." --&nbsp;John&nbsp;Wilson<br><br>"This is the one and only book I recommend relative to equities because, frankly, it's perfect. You quit listening, and start managing. Systematically. Four times per year. Meanwhile, you spend your newfound time on the rest of your life and leave your money stress behind." -- Lovelee<br><br>"I finally feel that I have near mechanical answers to philosophical questions that have confounded me, such as: If you want to buy low and sell high, how do you know when to sell? (The answer comes primarily from running a simple calculation once every quarter, with notable exceptions that dictate when you should just sit on your hands and wait.) No need to be concerned about whether we're headed for a bull or a bear market; all that matters is what happened this past quarter. Just rebalance your accounts, and move on. ... As I followed his reasoning behind each piece of the plan, he presciently anticipated and squashed almost every objection as they occurred to me." -- Jamie Low<br><br>"I'm currently running the plan in my 401(k) and IRA accounts. Having just finished my first quarterly rebalance of the plan in both accounts I must say that, for the first time in my investing life, I felt in control of my retirement savings!"-- Rick George"What the experts don't want you to know ... is that prices are all that matter. Ideas count for nothing; opinions are distractions.

Thoroughly revised and featuring new authors and content, the seventh edition raises the bar, adding age-related, cultural, societal, and population considerations in the practice of psychiatry to the authoritative text that generations of students, residents, and clinicians have heretofore relied upon. The book first focuses on foundational knowledge, with chapters on psychiatric interviewing, diagnostic formulation, developmental assessment, laboratory testing and neuroimaging, and ethical and legal aspects of clinical psychiatry, and then proceeds to a full presentation of psychiatric disorders in alignment with DSM-5. The third section offers an overview of treatment strategies and methods in present-day psychiatry, a combination of evidence-based biological interventions and psychotherapies, and gives a clear sense of exciting new directions in psychiatric therapeutics. The final section of the textbook is focused on the care of special patient populations, including women; children and adolescents; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals; older adults; and culturally diverse individuals. </p><p>Many topics are new to this volume, including the following: ? Suicide risk assessment, a critically important subject, is addressed in a new chapter that provides the reader with up-to-date knowledge needed to conduct a thorough, attuned, and accurate psychiatric interview in line with best practices.? A new chapter on the social determinants of mental health has been added, reflecting an increased emphasis on populations whose specific concerns have been historically underappreciated in American psychiatry, and illuminating factors that influence mental health needs and barriers to care in specific patient populations.? Precision psychiatry, an integrative approach that pulls together the scientific foundation of the discipline and recent technological advances and directs them toward closing the gap between discovery and clinical translation, is explored in a new chapter.? E-health strategies in mental health have become increasingly available to psychiatrists and other health professionals, especially in the mobile and monitoring spheres. A new chapter offers insights into these intriguing new options for delivering treatment.? A chapter on complementary and integrative therapies explores the integration of conventional medicine with alternative treatments for which there is an evidence base, providing an overview of nutrients, phytomedicines, hormones, mind--body practices, and electromagnetic treatments. </p><p>With features such as key clinical points and recommended readings for further study, The American Psychiatric Association Publishing Textbook of Psychiatry is a comprehensive course book, an indispensable reference, and the ultimate resource for clinical care.</p></p><p><p>The new seventh edition of The American Psychiatric Association Publishing Textbook of Psychiatry reflects advances in the understanding of the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric disorders as well as the positive, transformational change that has taken place in the field of psychiatry as a whole since the last edition.

In order to further reduce accidents and improve safety, proactive approaches must be adopted by the aviation community. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has mandated that all of its member states implement Safety Management System (SMS) programs in their aviation industries. While some countries (the United States, Australia, Canada, members of the European Union and New Zealand, for example) have been engaged in SMS for a few years, it is still non-existent in many other countries. This unique and comprehensive book has been designed as a textbook for the student of aviation safety, and as an invaluable reference tool for the SMS practitioner in any segment of aviation. It discusses the quality management underpinnings of SMS, the four components, risk management, reliability engineering, SMS implementation, and the scientific rigor that must be designed into proactive safety. The authors introduce a hypothetical airline-oriented safety scenario at the beginning of the book and conclude it at the end, engaging the reader and adding interest to the text. To enhance the practical application of the material, the book also features numerous SMS in Practice commentaries by some of the most respected names in aviation safety. In this second edition of Safety Management Systems in Aviation, the authors have extensively updated relevant sections to reflect developments since the original book of 2008. New sections include: a brief history of FAA initiatives to establish SMS, data-driven safety studies, developing a system description, SMS in a flight school, and measuring SMS effectiveness.</p><p>Alan J. Stolzer, Ph.D., FRAeS is Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies, and Professor and Chair of Doctoral Studies in the College of Aviation at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, Florida, USA. He holds a Ph.D. in Quality Systems from Indiana State University, and several professional certifications: Quality Engineer, Quality Manager, and Quality Auditor from the American Society for Quality; Project Management Professional from the Project Management Institute; Airline Transport Pilot, Flight Instructor with Instrument and Multi-Engine Ratings, and Airframe and Powerplant Mechanic from the Federal Aviation Administration. Dr. Stolzer has several thousand hours in more than 40 makes and models of fixed-wing aircraft. His research interests include safety, quality, flight operations quality assurance, safety management systems, and emergency preparedness.

Dr. Stolzer is involved in academic accreditation activities and has served as an expert witness and legal consultant on aviation accidents. John J. Goglia is an active consultant, author, and educator in the field of transportation safety. Mr. Goglia served as a Member of the National Transportation Safety Board from August 1995 to June 2004 and was the first Board Member to hold an FAA aircraft mechanic&#39;s certificate. As a Board Member, Mr. Goglia distinguished himself in numerous areas of transportation safety. In particular, he was instrumental in raising awareness of airport safety issues, including the importance of airport crash fire and rescue operations and the dangers of wildlife at airports, and played a key role in focusing international attention on the increasing significance of aircraft maintenance in aviation accidents. Mr. Goglia has been recognized many times for his contribution to aviation safety; awarding bodies include the National Air Disaster Alliance, Aviation Week and Space Technology, The Society of Automotive Engineers and the Air Transport Association (ATA). He currently serves on a number of Boards, including the Aviation Technical Training College in Singapore, and advises a number of organizations, including the Professional Aviation Maintenance Association. He is also a Senior Vice President with JDA Aviation Technology Solutions, consulting on transportation and safety issues.&#39;The first edition of Safety Management Systems in Aviation was widely recognized as the definitive guide to SMS, providing a comprehensive analysis of the history, the concepts and the implementation of these sometimes complex safety systems. This second edition builds on the first, expanding on certain data driven protocols, updating important statistical information, and including additional emphasis on general aviation and international (ICAO) concepts. Without a doubt, this edition of Safety Management Systems in Aviation should be required reading for every serious student of aviation safety, and in the library of every safety manager and aviation accident investigator.&#39; Capt. Jim Walters, former Director of Safety, TWA LLC; former Chairman, Air Line Pilots Association Accident Investigation Board; and former Lead Auditor, IOSA Safety Audit Team Reviews of previous edition: &#39;Managing safety in aviation has been elevated to the next level with the current emphasis on Safety Management Systems. Safety Management Systems in Aviation describes SMS as a proactive, preventive risk management process that includes hazard identification and mitigation, tools for gathering data, and methods of analysis. This book contributes significantly to the literature in the field of aviation safety and will be an invaluable source for all aviation safety professionals.&#39; Gary J. Northam, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, USA &#39;Finally, the aviation industry has recognized that effective safety management systems are necessary in today&#39;s complex operating environments. Fortunately, a fascinating, yet comprehensive guide to the organization, management, and successful implementation of these processes is now available. In Safety Management Systems in Aviation, Stolzer, Halford and Goglia have produced the definitive SMS manual; richly detailed and loaded with relevant, real-world examples. This book should be required reading for every aviation safety student and professional!&#39; Capt. Jim Walters, M.A.S., Former Director of Safety, TWA, FOQA and ASAP program manager &#39;This book explains the core elements of safety management in aviation in a unique and comprehensive manner and shows how safety can become tangible through best practice.

This began an insurgency that changed the course of American history: for the next few years white Southern Democrats waged a campaign of political terrorism aiming to overturn the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and challenge President Grant's support for the emergent structures of black political power. <i>Redemption</i> is the first book to describe in uncompromising detail this organized racial violence, which reached its apogee in Mississippi in 1875.</p></p><p><p><b>Nicholas Lemann</b>, dean of the School of Journalism at Columbia University, is author of <i>The Big Test</i> (FSG, 1999) and the prizewinning <i>The Promised Land</i>.

Their leaders had left for New Orleans on Wednesday to try to get help&#x2014;meaning, they hoped, a detachment of police or, even better, federal troops, who would come to protect the people in the village. The white militia was encamped out in the countryside a few miles away, and every day it was being reinforced with volunteers, mostly Confederate veterans who had heard the whites&#x2019; call for help, who had taken their shotguns and six-shooters and muskets and Springfield rifles from the Civil War down from the wall and saddled up their horses, and who had come to Colfax to fight for white supremacy. The Negroes, some of them at least, had guns, too, Enfield rifles shipped up from New Orleans in boxes and an assortment of lesser firearms, but by now there were many more people than guns to go around&#x2014;hundreds of people, including women and children, who had come to Colfax because they feared the whites&#x2019; bursting in on their homes and killing them. The Negro headquarters was the county courthouse, a two-story converted stable from a sugarcane plantation. At a short distance from it they had dug rudimentary breastworks, manned by sentries, to stave off the inevitable attack. All around, the Negroes from the countryside were camped out.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deeply lodged in the consciousness of the South was the ever-present possibility of a race war in which, in each side&#x2019;s version, it would be mercilessly slaughtered by the other. If the anticipated deaths themselves were not horrible enough, unspeakable atrocities would make them more so. Now the inevitable was about to happen, and the cause was something that registered, in that time and place, as being literally a matter of life and death: politics. The Civil War was not yet ten years in the past. The Deep South was still in a raw condition not far removed from war. The two political parties and the two races were still violently opposed to each other. The great national questions the war had raised had by no means been settled. They were going to be settled now, with profound and lasting consequences for the whole United States, in places like rural Louisiana, by hard men with intensely local concerns, through the means of an armed struggle that, for all the potency of the load of racial fantasy it carried, was really about who could vote and hold government office.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Colfax, Louisiana, was not really a town&#x2014;it was more a settlement, containing just five or six structures, and new even to that status. It was not insignificant, though. It sat in the exact center of the state on the banks of the Red River, a sugarcane or cotton planter&#x2019;s dream waterway because it was navigable in the countryside of central Louisiana, where roads were poor and railroads nonexistent, and because its floods had deposited a thick, rich layer of alluvial soil along its banks. The land around Colfax was lushly green and flat, and there was money in it. Local legend had it that Simon Legree, the plantation overseer in Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin who, in the public mind, symbolized the cruelty of American slavery, was based on a man named Robert McAlpin, who ran a plantation near Colfax called Hidden Hill, which Harriet Beecher Stowe had visited while preparing her book. The area around Colfax was lightly settled, with nearly impenetrable swamps and uncleared woods and labyrinthine bayous; within easy memory, it had been wild country where desperate, lawless people could live free from social control, and even now it was common to hear about sightings of wild animals and to see families of settlers in covered wagons passing by on their way to Texas.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Politically, Colfax was part of an experiment, a new Louisiana that would resemble the abolitionists&#x2019; prewar dream of how the South should be after its defeat in the Civil War. In 1868 a racially integrated (black-and-tan) Republican state legislature had created a new parish along the north bank of the Red River, drawing its boundaries so as to ensure that its local government would be Republican thanks to a Negro population majority. The parish was named Grant after the Republican president of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant, and its seat was named Colfax after the Republican vice president, Schuyler Colfax. To most local whites, these were unpleasantly resonant names: only a decade earlier, federal troops under General Grant&#x2019;s ultimate command&#x2014;he was not far away, in Mississippi&#x2014;had, as one white man from Colfax later remembered it, &#x201c;ravaged&#x201d; the Red River country using techniques taught them by the same &#x201c;experts in extermination&#x201d; that Grant&#x2019;s leading subordinate, General William Tecumseh Sherman, later used in his notoriously destructive march through Georgia. &#x201c;If it were in my power, I would, as soon as possible, change the name of Grant Parish to Lee and the site of her dispensatory of justice to Davis,&#x201d; another white resident asserted, referring to the Confederacy&#x2019;s commanding general and its president.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Easter Sunday 1873, Louisiana was in a state of low-grade warfare. In 1872, while President Grant was being reelected in a landslide, Louisiana had had a close and corrupt election. Both sides claimed victory, and now the state had two governors and two state legislatures, one Democratic and one Republican. A month after Election Day, federal troops dispatched by President Grant arrived in New Orleans, took control of the statehouse, expelled the Democratic government, and installed the Republicans. Grant Parish, appropriately enough given the condition of the state, had two political leaders, one from each party, each claiming control over the local police function&#x2014;the Republican a black Union veteran, born a slave, named William Ward, the Democrat a white Confederate veteran named Christopher Columbus Nash. &#x201c;In his face he bears the indications of all the worst qualities of his race and none of the better,&#x201d; a white organization later wrote about Ward; and, to judge by the one surviving photograph of Nash, he was a pretty rough character, too, with a full untrimmed black beard and close-set piercing eyes. Both men had had long, harsh experiences during the Civil War&#x2014;extensive combat, injury, and imprisonment. They had come, separately of course, to the raw Red River country after the war because they saw opportunity there&#x2014;specifically political opportunity.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening in 1871 Columbus Nash, then deputy sheriff of Grant Parish, led a mob of fifty armed white men to a house outside Colfax where two black Republican officeholders were living. The white men set the house on fire and shot the Negroes when they emerged; one of them survived by playing dead until the whites had left and then escaping. Legally, this incident fell under the category of law enforcement rather than crime, and Nash continued to serve as sheriff. William Ward was said to have killed a white man, or maybe two, that same year, though unlike the incident involving Nash, it was more a popular legend than a proven fact. In the version of the story most often told by the white people in Colfax, Ward had taken his victim out on the river in a skiff, hacked him to pieces with a hatchet, and dumped his remains overboard.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Republicans got the upper hand in New Orleans at the outset of 1873, thanks to the help of the U.S. Army, both Nash and Ward made it known that they wanted to be put in political authority in Grant Parish. The Republican governor, William Pitt Kellogg, vacillated, which was the worst thing he could do for the cause of stability in Grant Parish, and then appointed Ward&#x2019;s Republican forces. A meeting was held at the governor&#x2019;s office in New Orleans in March, with Ward, one of his lieutenants, and two Democrats allied with Columbus Nash. In the presence of the governor, the two sides started arguing, and one of the Democrats warned that if Nash was not made sheriff, there would be bloodshed. Ward returned to Colfax, called together his Republican political allies, and, unable to effect a peaceful transition of power because the Democrats wouldn&#x2019;t permit it, broke into the courthouse at night and took over the machinery of parish government, such as it was.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the whites that was intolerable. They could not accept Negro rule in Colfax, with the freed-slave, plantation-hand majority having legal authority over their former masters. In fact, from the whites&#x2019; perspective, the situation hadn&#x2019;t been tolerable for quite some time&#x2014;probably since antislavery sentiment had become an important force in national politics, years before the Civil War began. Just after the war, white Louisianans had been able to establish firm political control over the state; then, from 1868 to 1872, Louisiana had been ruled by a biracial, moderate, and corrupt Republican regime, and so had Grant Parish. Whether that kind of government could have lasted is impossible to say, because it didn&#x2019;t last, but even before a blacker, more radical version of the Republican Party took power, whites in Grant Parish felt they were living in an upside-down nightmare world. In a deep-rural, almost frontier culture, where most communication was by word of mouth, where they were greatly outnumbered, and where racial issues carried the heaviest possible economic, political, and psychological load, rumor and myth were rife, and they mattered...</p><h2>Fix, Freeze, Feast, 2nd Edition: The Delicious, Money-Saving Way to Feed Your Family; Stock Your Freezer with Ready-to-Cook Meals; 150 Recipes</h2><p>With this updated second edition of a best-selling cookbook, you can have it all &#x2014; great tasting, nutritious meals that don&#x2019;t break the bank <i>or</i> your daily schedule.

The New Testament belongs to all Christians, and the modern study of the New Testament has benefited from the contributions by scholars of all Christian denominations. But there are questions and issues in the New Testament that are specific to Catholics, such as the portrayal of Jesus' mother Mary, the commissioning of Peter, and the Trinity. In this volume, Joseph Kelly provides an introduction to the New Testament for students and deals with the concerns of modern Catholics reading the Bible. It's a book that Catholic teachers can <i>use</i> rather than a book that presents them with problems they have to<i> explain</i>.</p><p>Kelly helps readers to understand what modern scholars, especially Catholic biblical exegetes, say about the individual books because we cannot understand what role Jesus can play in modern life if we don 't understand what he meant to the earliest Christians.</p><p>The New Testament tells the story of Jesus, the most remarkable person who ever lived, and of his disciples. It includes some of the most famous narratives in the world and the most memorable words ever spoken. It introduces us to great people who moved history and of those who took the difficult step of leaving the religions of their ancestors and families to become Christians. Kelly shows that in looking at the New Testament we see real people communicating with us 'sharing their beliefs, their fears, and their hopes. Distant yet familiar, challenging yet comprehensible, the New Testament is a precious heritage, and one that Kelly recommends we must make our own.</p><p><i>Joseph F.

George Smiga</p><h2>George vs. George: The Revolutionary War as Seen by Both Sides</h2><p>There are two sides to every story. Rosalyn Schanzer's engaging and wonderfully illustrated book brings to life both sides of the American Revolution. <br><br>The narrative introduces anew the two enemies, both named George: George Washington, the man who freed the American colonies from the British, and George III, the British king who lost them. Two leaders on different sides of the Atlantic, yet with more in common than we sometimes acknowledge. We are lead through their story, and the story of their times, and see both sides of the arguments that divided the colonies from the Kingdom. Was King George a "Royal Brute" as American patriots claimed? Or was he, as others believed, "the father of the people?" Was George Washington a scurrilous traitor, as all the king's supporters claimed? Or should we remember and celebrate him as "the father of his country?" Who was right? History teaches us that there are two sides to every story. <br><br>Rosalyn Schanzer's book is an accessible account of one the most vital periods in American history. It is also a timeless lesson in seeing history from different points of view. The author spent two years researching books, paintings, cartoons, and descriptions of Revolutionary times. She uses art, text, and first-hand accounts to illustrate how history should never be reduced to simplistic conflicts between the "good guys" and the "bad guys." Her illustrations, and her engaging quote bubbles, bring the Revolution to life again, and allow the characters of the period to speak for themselves. Through its lively text, detailed illustrations, and fully authenticated quotes, <i>George vs. George</i> shines fresh light on both sides of the story of our country's formative years.</p><p>Rosalyn Schanzer is the award-winning author and illustrator of numerous books for young readers. An avid photographer, swimmer and adventurer, Schanzer lives in Virginia.Starred Review. Grade 3-6&#x2013;A carefully researched, evenhanded narrative with well-crafted, vibrant, watercolor illustrations. Schanzer states that her challenge was to "...cram 20 years of history, biography, and philosophy into a picture book that kids could grasp and enjoy." She has been entirely successful. The introduction sets the tone, introducing both George Washington and King George III, mentioning their differing views, and noting that every story has two sides. The remainder of the book presents these two sides on spreads that alternate between the man and the monarch, with comparisons of the American and British governmental forms, views on taxation, the Boston Tea Party, and coverage of most of the major battles of the Revolutionary War. True to the author's intent, both Georges come off as decent men, with the interests of their respective countries at heart. The illustrations are amazing. Almost Brueghelesque in their detail, they show the major players as they actually looked. Speech balloons reproduce the exact words of the speakers, with appended "Quote Sources." This is a lovely book, showing historical inquiry at its best: consideration of both sides, a sound research basis, attribution of sources, and interesting writing. Written at a higher level than Jean Fritz's <i>Can't You Make Them Behave, King George?</i> (Putnam, 1977), this book provides the perfect meld of instructional tool and general-interest reading.<i>&#x2013;Ann Welton, Grant Elementary School, Tacoma, WA</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This poignant memoir tells the painful story of a brutal slaying that captured national attention when it became the basis of the 2007 drama Alpha Dog. In the summer of 2000, Susan Markowitz's 15-year-old son, Nicholas, was kidnapped and murdered by a local drug dealer in revenge for his brother's debts. Nicholas's death, the ensuing trials of his killers, and the international manhunt for a fourth suspect nearly tore his family apart and sent his mother on a decade-long quest for justice and sanity. Markowitz writes with candor about her grief-induced alcoholism and suicide attempts as well as the troubles that shook her family's foundation long before Nicholas's death. Her unflinching honesty makes this a deeply powerful story that will move fans of the film and anyone grieving a loved one's death by homicide or suicide. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>A Reasonable Response</i>, renowned Christian philosopher and apologist William Lane Craig offers dozens of examples of how some of the most common challenges to Christian thought can be addressed, including:</p><ul><li>Why does God allow evil?</li><li>How can I be sure God exists?</li><li>Why should I believe that the Bible is trustworthy?</li><li>How does modern science relate to the Christian worldview?</li><li>What evidence do we have that Jesus rose from the dead?</li></ul><p>Utilizing real questions submitted to his popular website ReasonableFaith.org, Dr. Craig models well-reasoned, skillful, and biblically informed interaction with his inquirers. <i>A Reasonable Response</i> goes beyond merely talking about apologetics; it&nbsp;shows it in action. With cowriter Joseph E. Gorra, this book also offers advice about envisioning and practicing the ministry of answering people&#x2019;s questions through the local church, workplace, and in online environments.</p><p>Whether you're struggling to respond to tough objections or looking for answers to your own intellectual questions, <i>A Reasonable Response</i> will equip you with sound reasoning and biblical truth. </p></p><p><p>No sincere question about God is out of bounds. Here, one of the world's foremost apologists offers insightful answers to challenging inquiries sent to him - and models how to help people get past their spiritual sticking points.</p><p><b>Lee Strobel, author of <i>The Case for Christ</i> and <i>The Case for Faith.</i></b></p><p></p><p>The premise of this very helpful volume is stated up front: "questions are our friends." I couldn't agree more, and that's why I love this new book. Dr. Craig's responses to questions he's been asked over the years will stretch you, but with Joe Gorra's assistance you'll gain the benefit of understanding new insights, you won't regret the journey.</p><p><b>John Stonestreet, Author and Speaker for Colson Center for Christian Worldview (BreakPoint.org) and Summit Ministries (Summit.org).</b></p><p></p><p>What a book! Combining a top-notch reference work with solid, practical instruction, Bill Craig and Joe Gorra have created a unique and innovative title that will help all Christians grow and minister. Bill's sharp insights answering the biggest questions surrounding Christianity provide a rich resource for the pastor or apologist, while Joe's analysis and framework provides real-world wisdom that can be employed by the evangelist as well as the philosopher.</p><p>The book is thoughtfully organized to help the reader move logically through the material, even if many of the subjects are previously unfamiliar to him. The<i>Insights</i> into the questions are spot-on and the recommended resources offer further instruction. Gorra's opening comments draw the reader back to reason-giving ministries' true purpose of honoring Christ and building His kingdom.</p><p><i>A Reasonable Response</i> not only gives you the answers but shows the value of apologetics and helps the reader be a more effective communicator of the Gospel message. Equally at home as a small group guide or a personal growth tool, I cannot recommend<i>A Reasonable Response</i> highly enough.</p><p><b>Lenny Esposito, Founder and President, Come Reason Ministries (ComeReason.org).</b></p><p></p><p>As a pastor of 30+ years in two wonderful churches I know first-hand the importance of apologetics in the life of the church and the personal journey of believers. I've faced the questions of confused believers and disgruntled skeptics.<i>A Reasonable Response</i> is not only a tremendous resource because of its comprehensive content but also because of its user-friendly approach that leverages a Q&amp;A format. Dr. Craig strikes an incredible balance between gifted philosopher and compassionate sage. Of special interest are the appendixes which provide practical advice to pastors on recommendations for doing apologetics in the local church while highlighting mistakes and assumptions to avoid. If there is one book that a pastor should use to build his church's commitment to apologetics-this is it! I enthusiastically recommend this work by Dr. Craig &amp; Joseph Gorra.</p><p><b>Dr. Brent Strawsburg, Equipping &amp; Outreach Consultant, Conservative Baptist Association of Southern California</b></p><p></p><p>Dr. Craig's credentials are well known, so it will not surprise the reader that serious questions about God and the Christian life are answered with wisdom and respect. An added bonus to this work is how well the church and pastor are handled. I don't know of another book that answers the seeker, trains the Christian, and models the apologetic task in the context of the church as well as this one does. As a pastor, I am grateful for how this book approaches my vocation. It belongs in my church. It belongs in your church.</p><p><b>Phil Steiger, Senior Pastor, Living Hope Church (Colorado Springs, Colorado)</b></p><p></p><p>Unlike similar books that repackage the same tired answers to perennial questions,<i>A Reasonable Response</i> offers thoughtful and philosophica</p><b>WILLIAM LANE CRAIG</b> is a Research Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology in La Mirada, California.

Using realistic materials drawn from core legal topics, law students are guided to produce real-life documents while learning to reflect more deeply on what it actually means to think and work "like a lawyer. Each case file includes a set of practice-based documents, a narrowly-tailored assignment constructed to highlight application of legal rules to complex factual scenarios, commentary to guide users in working through the problem, and an example of how the legal principles at issue might be tested in a law school or bar examination question. Problems reinforce comprehension of foundational legal subjects, increase proficiency in the study and mastery of law, and help prepare beginning lawyers for a lifetime of practice. The book also includes useful checklists; tips to help users read, understand, and apply the materials; and in-depth discussions of sample responses to the accompanying exam questions. The materials in this text can be adapted to a wide array of law school courses: they offer a novel approach to a contemporary legal methods course, and they can also be used as a supplement for classes in torts, contracts, evidence, criminal law, property, or professional responsibility; a source for innovative projects for courses in lawyering or legal writing; or a resource for developing bar examination skills.</p><p>Kris Franklin is a Professor of Law and Director of the Academic Initiatives Program at New York Law School.</p><h2>Contemporary Intellectual Assessment: Theories, Tests, and Issues</h2><p>This leading practitioner reference and text--now in a revised and expanded fourth edition--provides the knowledge needed to use state-of-the-art cognitive tests with individuals of all ages, from preschoolers to adults.

They read a book, attend a class, or hire an expert to give them an edge. <br><br> But Alan Fine, an accomplished tennis, golf, and executive coach and a renowned authority on peak performance, believes that this "outside-in" method is precisely what's holding you back from doing your best work. He's found the biggest obstacle to improved performance isn't not knowing what to do; it's not doing what you already know. Ironically, the quest for information and instructions designed to help you get ahead can often interfere with your ability to focus on doing something. <br><br> Fine reveals his simple and proven approach to achieving breakthrough performance. It starts with reducing the interference that blocks your potential through an amazing process called G.R.O.W.

Covey</p><p>Over the years, one of the most important ideas I&#x2019;ve learned about and taught is the power of a &#x201c;paradigm shift&#x201d;&#x2014;of seeing something in a new and different way that creates a huge change in thinking and behavior.</p><p>In <i>You Already Know How to Be Great,</i> Alan Fine creates a paradigm shift of major proportion. Most often, he says, dramatic performance improvement does not come from gaining new knowledge; it comes from getting rid of the &#x201c;interference&#x201d; that gets in the way of using the knowledge and capacity we already have. That one idea has phenomenal implications and applications. It literally transforms the way we approach improving our own performance and also the way we approach helping others improve theirs.</p><p>Five Reasons Why I Like This Book</p><p>There are a number of reasons why Alan&#x2019;s approach resonates with my passion for effectiveness in leadership and in life.</p><p><b>TO BEGIN WITH,</b> it taps into two fundamental human desires that are deep within each of us&#x2014;the desire to be and do our best and the desire to be significant to others, to make a difference. These desires created a catalyst for my own work on <i>The 8th Habit</i>&#x2014;&#x201c;Find Your Voice and Inspire Others to Find Theirs.&#x201d; In <i>You Already Know,</i> Alan shares a paradigm and a process to help readers fulfill these basic desires by improving their own performance in any area of life and also helping others to improve theirs.</p><p><b>SECOND,</b> it&#x2019;s not some fad or &#x201c;flavor of the month.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s based on sound, universal principles. For example, Alan&#x2019;s approach recognizes top performance only comes when the <i>performer,</i> not the coach (or leader or manager or teacher or parent), proactively accepts responsibility for results. This frees individuals to release their talent and creativity and increase their performance capacity.</p><p><b>THIRD,</b> this approach is highly pragmatic. It not only acknowledges the principles of breakthrough performance; it provides both the performer and the &#x201c;coach&#x201d; a simple but robust way to implement them through Alan&#x2019;s GROW process.</p><p><b>FOURTH,</b> it stands solidly apart from approaches that while they enable people to perform in the moment create a dependency on the advice and direction of others. Truly great leaders, great managers, great coaches, and great parents help others strengthen their core capacity, thus empowering them to be effective not only in the moment but also in multiple applications over time.</p><p><b>FIFTH,</b> this approach is universally applicable. It provides a template that can help <i>any</i> individual improve performance in <i>any</i> area of life. It can help <i>any</i> group or team resolve <i>any</i> issue and improve performance in <i>any</i> organization. One of the important implications is that this truly is an approach for a global world.</p><p>I&#x2019;m excited by the insight this book provides into the nature of human performance and how to influence it in self and in others. I&#x2019;m even more excited by the language Alan has developed to help people understand and talk about performance issues and by the simple, highly pragmatic tools he has created to address them. But most of all, I&#x2019;m excited by the results. There are a lot of people with a lot of good ideas for making the world better. But Alan is one who&#x2019;s been able to translate ideas into simple doable actions that truly create breakthrough outcomes.</p><p>To me, this book is really a book about leadership&#x2014;both personal and public. It gives readers the vision and the tools to exercise personal leadership by improving their own performance and public leadership by helping others improve theirs. In doing so, it helps readers walk an enriching path of fulfillment and contribution. It is a truly landmark book on helping yourself and others journey to greatness.</p><p>UP FRONT</p><p>If we did the things we are capable of doing, we would literally astound ourselves.</p><p>THOMAS A. EDISON,<br> American inventor and businessman</p><p>Do any of these scenarios sound familiar?</p><p>ï¿½ You know that if you had a regular exercise program you&#x2019;d have more energy and feel better. You&#x2019;ve bought a variety of exercise equipment. You&#x2019;ve tried a lot of different types of programs. Each time, you&#x2019;ve lasted about three weeks. You ask yourself: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter with me? Do I just not have the character to do this&#x2014;or was I somewhere else when the exercise genes got passed out?&#x201d;</p><p>ï¿½ You&#x2019;ve been told that your job as a manager includes coaching the people in your division, so you&#x2019;ve been meeting with them regularly, giving them good instruction and trying to help them improve. But much of the time, your help doesn&#x2019;t seem to matter, and sometimes it&#x2019;s even rejected. One person you need to talk with about an accountability issue refuses to even meet with you. You think: &#x201c;How can I coach these people, and how can I do it in a way that will truly make a difference?&#x201d;</p><p>ï¿½ You&#x2019;re trying to help your daughter grow up to be a responsible adult, but you can&#x2019;t even get her to clean her room. You&#x2019;ve tried everything&#x2014;incentives, encouragement, punishment, withdrawal of privileges, even yelling&#x2014;but nothing seems to work. You wonder: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s it going to take to make her want to keep her room clean?&#x201d;</p><p>ï¿½ You&#x2019;re standing on the golf course at the first tee. You&#x2019;re playing with some clients, and you&#x2019;d really like to make a good impression. You know what it&#x2019;s like to hit a really nice drive, but you can&#x2019;t do it consistently. So you worry: &#x201c;What if I hit the ball into the trees or &#x2018;whiff&#x2019; it? What are these people going to think?&#x201d;</p><p>ï¿½ Your organization is not performing as well as you&#x2019;d like. You&#x2019;ve tried a variety of approaches and had some success, but the goals you set at the top never really make it down the line and your employees are not fully engaged. You spend most of your days dealing with internal problems instead of external opportunities. You keep asking yourself: &#x201c;How can I raise performance throughout the organization? What can I do to get everyone fully engaged and on the same page?&#x201d;</p><p>These scenarios represent a wide range of common experience, but they have one important element in common: they all deal with issues of performance&#x2014;either in self or in others. Most of us want the results of top performance. We want the enthused organization, the engaged work team, the exceeded sales quotas, the responsible child, the low handicap on the golf course, the increased energy and the washboard abs. But even when we know what it takes, we don&#x2019;t always have the tools that make those kinds of results possible.</p><p>This book is about those tools. It&#x2019;s about a paradigm, a principle, and a process that can lead to breakthrough performance in the workplace, on the golf course, in the boardroom, in the family room, or anyplace where higher performance makes a difference. It&#x2019;s about how to improve performance in your own life and also in the lives of those you are trying to help. It&#x2019;s based on the premise that</p><p></p><p>EVERYONE has the potential to perform better;</p><p>potential is blocked by interference;</p><p>interference can be reduced by focused attention; and</p><p>focused attention can be simply and systematically increased.</p><p></p><p>Let Me Introduce Myself</p><p>My name is Alan Fine. I began my career teaching tennis in Wales. In my search to be a better coach, I stumbled onto a paradigm of human performance and a simple process to improve it that have led me to successfully coach CEOs, managers, and leaders in organizations worldwide, as well as world-class golfers such as David Feherty, Colin Montgomerie, Phil Price, and Stephen Ames.</p><p>The primary focus of my company&#x2014;InsideOut Development&#x2014;is working with business leaders and managers, and that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve spent most of the past twenty-five years doing. But I&#x2019;ve also been thrilled to see how people immediately apply these principles in other areas, including parenting, sports, hobbies, and the performing arts. As many have observed, this &#x201c;whole life&#x201d; approach consistently reinforces the paradigm and process, making it significantly easier to improve performance both on and off the job.</p><p>As I&#x2019;ve worked with these ideas over the years, two things have become clear to me:</p><p><b>1.</b> When we don&#x2019;t understand the nature of human performance, we tend to diagnose performance problems and come up with solutions from a perspective that represents only a fraction of what it takes to be a top performer; and the solutions we come up with typically do not sustain long-term performance improvement.</p><p><b>2.</b> If we don&#x2019;t have a way to consistently make quick, accurate decisions and execute them well in today&#x2019;s fast-paced global economy, we&#x2019;re going to be left in the dust.</p><p>This book can help you both understand human performance and make quick, accurate decisions in moving ahead. It will give you a simple, effective paradigm and a scalable, replicable process that will enable you to consistently improve performance in any area of life.</p><p>My Invitation to You</p><p><i>You Already Know How to Be Great</i> has been written in response to the many requests I have received over the years to put the inside-out performance principles into writing. It reflects my ongoing quest to make these principles highly practical and simple to apply in everyday life.</p><p>My invitation to you is to simply play with the ideas in these pages and use what&#x2019;s helpful to you. As you will discover, this book is less about gaining new knowledge and more about getting rid of what&#x2019;s keeping you from using the knowledge you already have. It&#x2019;s less about doing new things and more about understanding and giving language and order to some of the great things you already do, so that you can do those things more consistently and with better results.</p><p>I encourage you to approach this book in whatever way you feel will work best for you. If you like supportive research and quotes, check out the call-out boxes. If you want to give the content deeper personal thought, go through the Reflective Questions at the end of each chapter. If you prefer to skip the research and questions, just read the text. I do recommend that you pay particular attention to each of the stories. They represent the &#x201c;live&#x201d; research for this book. They come from people who have had experience with this material not only in their organizations but also in their personal lives. Because the fundamental ideas are based on principles, even if you don&#x2019;t happen to be a manager or a leader or a teacher or a parent now, you&#x2019;ll find the insights shared by these individuals can be applied in almost any situation. Besides, you never know when you might end up in one of these roles.</p><p>I also invite you to check out the You Already Know How to Be Great online community at www.alan-fine.com, where you can find additional examples, exercises, and tools to help you apply the principles in each chapter of this book. Within the community, you&#x2019;ll also be able to learn from the experiences of others and share your own experiences so that others can learn from you. I&#x2019;ve placed a link at the end of each chapter as a reminder of this additional resource.</p><p>I&#x2019;m excited to share these principles and tools with you. I certainly don&#x2019;t have all the answers. And I&#x2019;m not suggesting that what&#x2019;s in this book is a panacea for every performance issue. But in years of coaching, I&#x2019;ve become convinced that understanding some essential elements of human performance and having a simple process to influence those elements can help you achieve your greatness in any arena. My guess is that deep inside, you&#x2014;and the people you&#x2019;re trying to help&#x2014;have nurtured some dreams of what&#x2019;s possible in life, but that &#x201c;stuff&#x201d; has gotten in the way of realizing those dreams. It&#x2019;s my hope that this book will help you get rid of the &#x201c;stuff&#x201d; and free you&#x2014;and those you help&#x2014;to make those dreams come true.</p><p>ALAN FINE</p><p></p><p>Part 1</p><p>PARADIGM and PRINCIPLE</p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>A Blinding Glimpse of the <b>OBVIOUS</b></p><p>As I look back, it seems that everything was gray&#x2014;the sky, the pavement, the walls surrounding the pavement, the castlelike building with its turret-topped roof, even the endless terraced rows of tiny, two-up, two-down houses outside the walls. From a distance, there was no indication that this very gray place&#x2014;the Mackintosh Tennis Club&#x2014;was the home of some of the best tennis players in Wales. There was also no indication that this place would become the scene of one of the greatest epiphanies of my life or that it would open the door for me to help managers, leaders, salespeople, athletes, teachers, musicians, parents, and others around the world achieve breakthrough performance.</p><p>The journey that led me to this place on that eventful morning was something of a fluke. It had begun years before when I was eleven and my brother entered me as a contestant in our school tennis tournament. I was a severely asthmatic, skinny, and painfully shy kid, and up to that point, I&#x2019;d only been on a tennis court three times in my life. Somehow I found myself in the finals and discovered I was up against a thirteen-year-old who was six feet tall and captain of the rugby team&#x2014;the school &#x201c;jock.&#x201d; To this day, I can remember exactly where I was standing on the court when I suddenly realized that I was ahead, 6&#x2013;4, 4&#x2013;0. I remember a voice in my head saying, &#x201c;Okay, you&#x2019;ve won ten games. You only have to win two more, and you&#x2019;ll be the school champion! How hard can that be?&#x201d; Suddenly I froze. I didn&#x2019;t win another game. The jock beat me 6&#x2013;0 in the final set. I could feel the disappointment of my PE instructor all the way from across the court and up on the second tier of the playground. I could sense the kids who had been watching whispering, &#x201c;Wow! What happened to him?&#x201d; All I could think in that moment was, &#x201c;Please, please don&#x2019;t let me cry!&#x201d;</p><p>Though I was mortified by the defeat, from that day I decided to take up tennis with a vengeance.

In Vietnam, Larry Vetter served as a platoon leader in Third Recon Battalion. He supplements his own recollections with Marine Corps records, exhaustive interviews with veterans, and correspondence to capture the bravery, and self-sacrifice of war.</p><p><b>Lawrence C. Vetter, Jr</b>. is the author of <i>Never Without Heroes: Marine Third Reconnaissance Battalion in Vietnam, 1965-70 </i>and <i>Blood on the Lotus</i>. Vetter served with the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion in Vietnam for seven months in 1966. He wrote <i>Never Without Heroes </i>to tell the story of the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, 3rd Marine Division, during its time in Vietnam from 1965 until 1969 in an effort to reflect &#x201c;the best of American heroism.&#x201d;The Beginning<br> &nbsp;<br> On May 7, 1965, the Headquarters of the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion landed in Vietnam. Several platoons from the battalion had preceded it as attachments to the 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, which had landed on March 8. During the next four and one-half years, Marines of the 3rd Recon Battalion conducted reconnaissance operations in Vietnam; the battalion was withdrawn in November 1969. In that time period, approximately 2,800 Marines served as part of the battalion. Colonel Patrick G. Collins (Ret.), who was one of the first Recon Marines in Vietnam, has researched the records and found that, while on duty with the 3rd Recon Battalion, four of those Marines received the Medal of Honor, thirteen received the Navy Cross, and seventy-three the Silver Star. Because of those men, the countless others who received awards, and the even greater number who were better honored by the respect of their peers, the battalion itself was awarded one Presidential Unit Citation, two Navy Unit Citations, one Meritorious Unit Citation, and eleven battle stars for Vietnamese service. Not noted in that list are the unit awards that elements of the battalion received when attached to other commands. But statistics are devoid of life. Behind each award were human emotions, and quite often blood.<br> &nbsp;<br> The anxiety that did not show on the faces of Recon Marines but stirred their stomachs as they sat waiting for the &#x201c;birds&#x201d; to come can be understood a little better by examining the substantial odds they faced while in action against enemy units. During their time in Vietnam, 1,121 Marines and 12 Navy Corpsmen from the battalion were killed, wounded, or missing in action. Encountering enemy forces far superior in number, confronting them in jungles, mountains, valleys, and villages miles distant from friendly faces, resulted in countless moments of personal crisis. In spite of swearing never to be taken alive, a few Marines were captured, usually after being wounded.* During those four and one-half years, seven Recon Marines and one corpsman were missing in action although two of the MIAs escaped back to the battalion and the bodies of two others were recovered.<br> &nbsp;<br> The casualty figures show that approximately 40 percent of the Marines and U.S. Navy Corpsmen who served in the 3rd Recon Battalion during the Vietnam conflict were wounded or killed in action. Unmentioned is the fact that all the others from time to time had excellent reason to fear death. The acts of courage that are the foundation for those facts and figures are, for the most part, an as yet untold story, remaining in the memories of men who served. Recon Marine or Navy Corpsman, all were united by a unique and extraordinary psyche that fused allegiance, vitality, and resolve into a fighting spirit that enabled individuals to overcome personal fears and unexpected odds. Floyd Nagler, a veteran of the battalion in 1969, states:<br> &nbsp;<br> Those of us who left &#x2019;Nam and the experience of being a Recon team member also left a piece of our souls somewhat disconnected. While none of us can ever regain the adrenaline high or unbelievably close social bond we experienced, an understanding of the slight pain we all feel from that vacuum in our souls, resulting from the team separation, is a need we all equally share.<br> &nbsp;<br> The unit command chronologies held in the U.S. Marine Corps Historical Center at the Washington Navy Yard indicate that battalion recon teams sighted a total of 37,049 enemy and accounted for 2,534 enemy killed in action (KIA), 2,712 either wounded or suspected KIA, and 76 individuals captured who were either known enemy or suspected to be so.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not accounted for in this data is the additional effect of responses by infantry or air units in support of a recon patrol but not observed by the patrol. Neither do the patrol reports include numbers that were not recorded in the battalion records because they were submitted to infantry units by Recon teams attached to them.<br> &nbsp;<br> In spite of the battalion&#x2019;s accomplishments, the Recon Marine&#x2019;s worth in Vietnam has not yet truly been acknowledged. But the words of Bill Buhl, a respected &#x201c;mustang&#x201d; lieutenant in the battalion in 1965&#x2013;66, are perhaps most appropriate: &#x201c;Those fine young Recon Marines who performed so well, before, during, and after our respective tours, need look only to their peers for the recognition they genuinely deserve.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion did not simply appear for the first time in Vietnam. The lineage of the battalion begins with Company E (Scouts) 3rd Tank Battalion, 3rd Marine Division, which was created in 1942. In April 1944, it was redesignated the Amphibious Reconnaissance Company, Headquarters Battalion, 3rd Marine Division. During World War II, the unit participated in the Bougainville, Solomon Islands, Guam, and Iwo Jima campaigns. Then it was deactivated until the Korean War. In 1956, it was again deactivated, but on April 15, 1958, it was reactivated as the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, 3rd Marine Division. It remained an active unit in the Fleet Marine Force, headquartered in Okinawa, until recently, when it was deactivated and its mission assumed by Scout companies assigned to infantry units.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most of the publicity surrounding the special elite units of the Marine Corps during World War II has been devoted to the Raider battalions, but a little bit of history will tell us something about the forerunner of the Recon Battalion, the Scout companies. In August 1942, the United States took the offensive against the Japanese war machine, and Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands was first on the hit list. Just twenty miles across Iron Bottom Sound from &#x201c;The Canal&#x201d; was the smaller island of Tulagi, and that&#x2019;s where the Raiders hit the beach. However, the unsung heroes that were the Scout companies received orders for the main battle on the ninety-mile-long island of Guadalcanal. They were the units that evolved into the reconnaissance battalions that served in Vietnam.<br> &nbsp;<br> George Neville, Sr., was a Marine Scout in the early days of World War II. Neville states that his unit had been conducting cold weather exercises in Iceland when Pearl Harbor was attacked. He describes how they trained using motorcycles and lightly armored vehicles sporting .50-caliber and .30-caliber machine guns. Before long the units were aboard a ship and sailing into the &#x201c;Slot,&#x201d; shown on the maps as Sea Lark Channel, a charming name for a body of water later to be known as Iron Bottom Sound. The channel was given this nickname in grim tribute to the work of the skilled and deadly Rear Admiral Gunichi Mikawa and his 25th Air Flotilla. In the early morning of August 10, 1942, Mikawa&#x2019;s eight-ship task force sank four American cruisers and one destroyer, and severely damaged a fifth cruiser, in the channel&#x2014;thus, Iron Bottom Sound. This battle occurred within sight of Mr. Neville and his Marines, fighting on Guadalcanal with Japanese to their front, and now with a good portion of the American navy sunk in the waters behind them.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Scouts had landed on August 7, 1942, but had gone ashore without their vehicles. They returned to the ship on August 9, intending to bring the armored vehicles off the next day. But that night they were rushed over the side because the enemy navy had been sighted entering the Slot. The Marines got to the shore safely but their scout cars were made into fish houses by the Japanese. The real battle lasted only forty-six minutes and sent 1,024 Allied seamen to their deaths. With 5,000 Japanese troops on the island ready to do battle, the Marines couldn&#x2019;t spend too much time worrying about who controlled the seas behind them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Neville relates:<br> &nbsp;<br> During the battle for Guadalcanal the recon scouts were used basically according to the dictates of the infantry commander we were attached to. Our patrol size varied from small groups (three to four) to platoon size, depending on the mission. We scouted ahead of the infantry, but we were not able to go too far in front of our lines because the enemy was hiding in the jungles not far away. In fact, those front lines got mixed up quite often&#x2014;with us in the middle of it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The platoon was constantly moved around and separated into small groups. Our mission was never very clear, nor was it uniform. It all depended on the infantry officer who was using us. We carried &#x2019;03 Springfields, Thompsons, and light, air-cooled machine guns. Those, however, didn&#x2019;t do a hell of a lot of good when we were being shelled by the enemy cruisers from the Slot.<br> &nbsp;<br> One particular mission we were given was to counter the Japanese who were sneaking through our lines at night. They would hide in trees inside our lines and snipe at us during the day. We were told to lay in knee-high grass inside our lines, at night, and wait for them to try to get through. Our orders were to engage them with bayonets and hand-to-hand combat for fear of shooting our own men. Remember, this was in the dark. Doesn&#x2019;t that sound like John Wayne for you. Hell, I was scared to death. My platoon left the &#x201c;Canal&#x201d; in December, and I was proud of my time in the Corps, but I was glad to survive.<br> &nbsp;<br> Recon Marines have been on foot ever since those scout cars reached the bottom of Sea Lark Channel. However, after the war, two basic types of Marine reconnaissance units evolved.<br> &nbsp;<br> Assigned to conduct preassault and distant postassault reconnaissance in support of the landing force are the Force Reconnaissance companies. There were four active duty Force Recon companies in the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War, although the 3rd and the 5th were later deactivated. In the 1980s Force Recon companies began the highly specialized training designed to prepare them for such missions as the capture or rescue of oil rigs, aircraft, and other point targets. In theory, Force Recon units are to be attached to the Amphibious or Expeditionary Force, which is a superior command to the division; therefore, they are designed to operate over a wider and deeper battlefield than the Recon battalions and should not be attached to the division or infantry regiment or battalion. Each of those companies had six platoons. Scuba and jump schools were mandatory.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Gino&#39;s Italian Express</h2><p><p><b>From bestselling cookery author, Gino D'Acampo, comes a brand-new cookbook inspired by a culinary journey along Italy's most famous rail journeys. </b></p><p><i>Gino's Italian Express</i> is a celebration of the delicious and authentic local foods Gino discovered on his train travels across beautiful Italy.

Too many birders will get an inconclusive view of a bird and then just guess. With practice, you can identify birds from incredibly short glimpses of them, but there will always be some "I don't knows" And even if you do get a good look and still can't identify the bird, you will have learned from the process. The next time you see that species, it will be familiar to you and you may see another field mark or behavior to help in its identification. And don't forget to watch the birds as well! Keeping a checklist is fun and a way to record your sightings, but careful observations will help you really understand these interesting creatures.

After his war torn boyhood in Navarre, Francis Xavier went to the University of Paris, determined to have a good time. He was interested in sports and became broad jumping champion of his college, and did not pay much attention to his studies. At first he scoffed at this fellow student, Ignatius Loyola, a former soldier who wanted to win the world for God. But Ignatius showed him that true champions are a far more heroic breed - those who risk their all to win the world for God. Francis joined Ignatius' followers, and became one of the first members of the Society of Jesus.</p><p>Francis Xavier was selected by Ignatius to do missionary work in India. To all sixteenth-century travelers, a voyage from Portugal to India meant months of deadly peril from storms, pirates, and diseases. But to Father Francis Xavier, it also meant a chance to win the Orient for Jesus Christ. This great saint's eagerness to spread the Word of God involved him with the pearl divers of the Indian coast, the natives of Malaya and the Spice Islands, the cannibals of Morotni and the hostile feudal lords of ancient Japan.

Hanging back on the bare ground behind her was a big-breasted, comely woman with long, dark hair and dressed like a dollar-store buckle bunny in a western pantsuit, cowboy boots, and dangling turquoise earrings. <i>Not bad</i>, Gerald thought. Two kids stood nearby, a towheaded toddler and an indifferent high-school chick who looked as if she might like to be anywhere else at that moment.<br><br>They needed some help. A <i>man&#x2019;s</i> help.Their trailer&#x2019;s electrical plug was 110, but the park&#x2019;s hookups were 220. The manager knew Gerald was a handyman at the mine, so she thought he might be able to save everybody an electrician&#x2019;s bill (and a city inspection) with some under-the-table quick-fix. Gerald took a look, consulted with the power company, and got to work.<br><br>It was lunchtime when he finished so Gerald offered to buy burgers at the Husky Truck Stop cafe. Their conversation was heavier than the usual get-acquainted banter.<br><br>Her name was Alice Prunty. Her same story had been told in a thousand other trailer parks every day: She was a widowed nurse and single mom scrabbling for a fresh start. Although she was only in her thirties, she&#x2019;d been married twice and borne five kids, three of whom were still school age or younger. She divorced her first husband, a cop in her native Illinois, and her second&#x2014;a philandering Midwestern grain-elevator operator and World War II vet who drifted to Wyoming ranchwork&#x2014;died from alcoholism, leaving her a pile of debt, an infant daughter, and a piddling widows-and-orphans pension from the US Army.<br><br>So since that guy, Don Prunty, died a couple years ago, she&#x2019;d filed for bankruptcy, toiled as a barmaid and bus driver, nursed a few months in a small-town psychiatric hospital, and farmed-out the kids to relatives back East when things got tight, which was frequently.&nbsp; To hear her tell it, just another star-crossed mom busting her ass to hang on to the edge of a savage earth hurtling through time and space.<br><br><i>Nice boobs</i>, Gerald mooned to himself.<br><br>&#x201c;You like to fish?&#x201d; he asked her.<br><br>&#x201c;I love it,&#x201d; Alice replied.<br><br>&#x201c;I know a place. . .&#x201d; he said. He told her about Atlantic Creek, way up in the Shoshone National Forest, up above the old mining camps of South Pass and Atlantic City. It was barely wider than his truck but chock-full of little brook trout. They made a date to meet the next morning for a day of hiking and fishing up in the mountains. Alice was giddy.<br><br>Maybe Gerald was a sucker for love, but he was hooked. Alice was easy on the eyes, earned her own paychecks, seemed like a resourceful gal, already had kids and a trailer, and she liked to fish. <i>Damn</i>. He barely slept.<br><br>The next morning dawned sunny and warm. Alice showed up outside the trailer with her sprightly three-year-old, Eliza, and her own fishing rod. That impressed the hell out of Gerald. They all piled into Gerald&#x2019;s old truck and headed up the mountain with a can of worms and a picnic lunch, and they fished all day. Alice frowned upon the scrappy little brookies&#x2014;she liked &#x2019;em bigger&#x2014;but she was a good sport about it. She also kept a tight leash on Eliza, who never acted up once. Alice was in complete control&#x2014;unlike Virginia&#x2014;and that turned Gerald on.<br><br>For his part, Gerald recited jokes from old comedy LPs he&#x2019;d memorized. Alice laughed at all his stolen humor.<br><br>Over a picnic of cold-cut sandwiches, Gerald listened patiently as Alice skipped through her life&#x2019;s arduous tale, never pausing long at any painful memory nor giving much detail. She&#x2019;d been born to an unwed teenage mother in Denver, adopted by a young soldier and his wife, raised in an Illinois farm town, got pregnant and married at sixteen, birthed four kids in quick succession, divorced, married again to the boozer who dragged her to Wyoming to be caretakers of a historic ranch then abruptly died, stranding her and their new baby in this beautiful, god-forsaken place at the end of the earth. But there was nothing more for her back East. Her only chance to climb out of her hole, to make her own way, was here.<br><br>There by Atlantic Creek, he felt Alice&#x2019;s pain. She was still young and earnest, and Gerald didn&#x2019;t think she deserved all the pain she&#x2019;d already endured. But she was a survivor, not a straggler&#x2014;unlike Virginia. He reckoned, if things worked out the way he hoped, that he could make Alice&#x2019;s life better. He could give her what she deserved.<br><br>Later, they packed up their rods and their creels full of brookies, and hiked out. On the bumpy pickup ride home, Gerald knew he had a keeper. Any woman confident enough to venture into the boondocks with a stranger and bare her soul was a woman he wanted to ride with, he thought.<br>In that long, hot, bicentennial summer of 1976, Gerald and Alice fell in love. Hard and fast.<br><br>On one of their first real dates&#x2014;playing pool at a Main Street tavern&#x2014;Alice confessed that she, too, had been immediately attracted to Gerald when she first laid eyes on him. Then she beat him soundly at a game he thought he could win.<br><br>After a couple more dates, they tumbled into bed. Not one of those forbidden teenager liaisons, but a full-on fuckfest between two consenting adults who&#x2019;d already bumped a lot of other uglies. And Alice especially knew what she was doing. If Gerald had any reservations about her before he saw her naked, they now lay in a crumpled heap on the bedroom floor.<br><br>It was dark outside when the grunting stopped and they slumped back on the wet sheets. Alice cuddled against him. It was the part of lovemaking he didn&#x2019;t like so much: talking.<br><br>But Alice had a story to tell and she told it softly.<br><br>There had been another husband. Her third. After the alcoholic one. A crazy man, a junkie, a door-gunner in Vietnam who&#x2019;d been kicked out of the Army for being nuts.&nbsp; Named Ron Holtz. She met him in a small-town VA psych ward where she&#x2019;d taken a nursing job. They fell in love and ran off together to get married, even though she knew it was wrong. They rented a trailer house in Cheyenne, where he drove a cab to support his habit. Then he started beating her and threatening the baby when she cried. He boasted that he&#x2019;d killed babies in &#x2018;Nam and he&#x2019;d kill her, too.<br><br>One night around Christmas, Ronnie Holtz went berserk, and Alice shot him before he could harm the baby. It was self-defense. She didn&#x2019;t have a choice. She stuffed the brute&#x2019;s body in a cardboard storage barrel and drove her Pinto into the frigid blackness to drop it down a remote, abandoned mine shaft on the historic ranch she&#x2019;d managed with her other late husband. She raced home, hurriedly packed up her possessions, and left town before anybody missed either of them.<br><br>And nobody ever did. They&#x2019;d barely cast a shadow in Cheyenne. A few months later, she filed for a divorce, claiming abandonment. It was granted when Ron Holtz failed to show up in court.<br><br>Alice wept on her new lover. A speechless Gerald, dumbfounded by the confession, just hugged her tight. She told him she wasn&#x2019;t sure if he could love her now, but he promised he&#x2019;d never tell a soul. <i>Never</i>. He also reassured her that some assholes like Ron Holtz just needed killing, although he secretly wondered why she didn&#x2019;t just run away.<br><br>Either way, lying there in the dark, naked and laid bare, Alice&#x2019;s secret became their bond.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t know why she picked that particular moment to reveal it. Maybe she felt safe with him, or to test him, or to nudge him a little off-balance. Or maybe it was a warning shot in case he ever raised a hand to her.<br><br>But Gerald swore to himself he&#x2019;d never let Alice go. She was a keeper.&nbsp;<br><br>And although he wasn&#x2019;t especially well-churched, it all felt to him like Adam and Eve, after Eve confessed to biting the apple but before the clueless Adam knew what it all meant.</p><h2>Queen of the World: Elizabeth II: Sovereign and Stateswoman</h2><p><p><strong>Written by renowned royal biographer, Robert Hardman, and with privileged access to the Royal Family and the Royal Household, this is a brilliant new portrait of the most famous woman in the world and her place in it.</strong></p><p>On today's world stage, there is one leader who stands apart from the rest. Queen Elizabeth II has seen more of the planet and its people than any other head of state and has engaged with the world like no other monarch in modern history.</p><p>The iconic monarch never ventured further than the Isle of Wight until the age of 20 but since then has now visited over 130 countries across the globe in the line of duty, acting as diplomat, hostess and dignitary as the world stage as changed beyond recognition.

Dyer is suspected of conducting an elaborate Ponzi scheme, similar to that employed by Mr. Madoff, and of bilking some three hundred clients of more than three hundred million dollars. Investors, who believed their money was being put in bank-secured CDs with double-digit yields, were, in fact, funding Mr. Dyer&#x2019;s lavish lifestyle, which included a private jet, a seventy-eightfoot motor yacht, and homes in Westchester, Palm Springs, Palm Beach, Florida&#x2019;s Gulf Coast, and the Caribbean island where the alleged securitizing bank was allegedly located.</p><p>For at least five years, investors did receive the promised returns, which were apparently paid out of successive investors&#x2019; deposits, rather than the nonexistent CDs. When clients, faced with a faltering economy and plummeting stock prices, requested their principal back, the scheme was uncovered.</p><p>Although investigators have seized records and frozen all of Mr. Dyer&#x2019;s known accounts and assets, the majority of the missing money is assumed to be offshore. Dyer&#x2019;s whereabouts are unknown.</p><p><i><b>One</b></i></p><p>Though she was careful not to show it, Madeline Singer did not fall apart when her youngest child left for college. In the Atlanta suburb where she lived, women wilted all around her. Tears fell. Antidepressants were prescribed.</p><p>Her friends, lost and adrift, no longer recognized themselves without children to care for. A collective amnesia descended, wiping out all the memories of teenaged angst and acts of hostility that had preceded their children&#x2019;s departures, much as the remembered pain of childbirth had been washed away once the newborn was placed in their arms.</p><p>Madeline kept waiting for the emptiness of her nest to smite her. She loved her children and had loved being a stay-at-home mother, but while she waited for the crushing blow, she took care of all the things that she&#x2019;d never found time for while Kyra and Andrew were still at home. Throughout that fall while her friends went for therapy, shared long liquid lunches, and did furtive drive-bys and drop-ins to the high school where they&#x2019;d logged so many volunteer hours, Madeline happily responded to her children&#x2019;s phone calls and texts, but she also put twenty years&#x2019; worth of pictures into photo albums. Then she cleaned out the basement storage unit and each successive floor of their house, purging and sorting until the clutter that had always threatened to consume them was finally and completely vanquished.</p><p>After that she threw herself into the holidays and the mad rush of shopping and cooking and entertaining, trying her best not to let the free-falling economy dampen the family festivities. Andrew came home from Vanderbilt and Kyra, fresh out of Berkeley&#x2019;s film school and two months into her first feature film shoot, arrived in the first flush of adulthood and once again became the center of the known universe.</p><p>Pushing aside daydreams of the projects she&#x2019;d undertake once they were gone again, Madeline fed her children and their friends, made herself available when their friends weren&#x2019;t, and didn&#x2019;t even react to the fact that she was barely an appendage to their lives. Steve, who loved the trappings of a family Christmas with the ferocity of an only child, seemed worried and distracted, but when she raised the subject he found a way to change or avoid it.</p><p>While basting the turkey on Christmas Day, Madeline realized that she was more than ready for her husband to go back to the office and for her children to go back to their new lives so that she could finally begin her own.</p><p>On this first day of March, the house was once again blissfully quiet. There was no television. No music. No video game gunfire or crack of a bat. No texts coming in or going out with a ding. No refrigerator opening or closing. No one&#x2014;not one person&#x2014;asking what was for dinner, when their laundry would be done, or whether she had a spare twenty.</p><p>Standing in the center of Kyra&#x2019;s vacant bedroom, Madeline inhaled the quiet, held it in her lungs, and let it soak into her skin. Her nest was not only empty, it was totally and completely organized. It was time for her &#x201c;new&#x201d; life to begin.</p><p>Not for the first time, she admitted something might be wrong with her. Because the silence that so alarmed her friends sent a tingle of anticipation up her spine. It made her want to dance with joy. Go hang gliding. Cure cancer. Learn how to knit. Write the Great American Novel. Or do absolutely nothing for a really long time.</p><p>Her life could be whatever she decided to make of it.</p><p>Throwing open the windows to allow the scents of an early spring to fill the room, Madeline mentally converted the space into the study/craft room she&#x2019;d always dreamed of. She&#x2019;d put a wall of shelves for her books and knickknacks here. A combination desk and worktable there. Maybe a club chair and ottoman for reading in the corner near the window.</p><p>Madeline entertained herself for a time measuring the windows for a cornice that she might just make herself. This afternoon she could go to the fabric store and see what looked interesting. Maybe she&#x2019;d hit some of her favorite antique stores and see about a worktable and a club chair that she could re-cover.</p><p>For lunch she made a quick sandwich and then sat down at the kitchen table to read through the <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i> , Steve&#x2019;s <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and the local weekly. She was in the middle of a story about yet another financial advisor who&#x2019;d absconded with his unsuspecting clients&#x2019; money when the phone rang&#x2014;an especially shrill sound in the cocoon of silence in which she was wrapped.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Singer?&#x201d; The voice was female, clipped, but not unfriendly. &#x201c;This is St. Joseph&#x2019;s calling.&#x201d;</p><p>Madeline&#x2019;s grip on the phone tightened; she braced for a full-body blow. &#x201c;A Mrs. Clyde Singer was brought in about thirty minutes ago. She was suffering from smoke inhalation and a gash on her forehead. We found this number listed as emergency contact on the file from her last visit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Smoke inhalation?&#x201d; Madeline hovered near her chair, trying to get her thoughts in order. &#x201c;Is she all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s resting now, but she&#x2019;s been through quite a lot, poor thing. There was a kitchen fire.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, my God.&#x201d; Madeline turned and raced upstairs, carrying the phone with her. Last month her mother-in-law had fallen in the bathroom and been lucky not to break anything. At eighty-seven, living alone had become increasingly difficult and dangerous, but Edna Singer had refused to consider giving up her home and Steve had been unwilling to push his mother on it. Madeline got the room number and a last assurance that the patient looked a bit beat up but would be fine. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll probably take me about twenty-five minutes to get there.&#x201d;</p><p>Exchanging her shorts for a pair of slacks and slipping her feet into loafers, she called Steve&#x2019;s cell phone as she clattered down the front stairs. After leaving a voice mail with the pertinent details, Madeline headed for the garage, stopping only long enough to look up Steve&#x2019;s office number, which she so rarely called she hadn&#x2019;t even programmed it into her cell phone. Adrienne Byrne, who&#x2019;d sat in front of Steve&#x2019;s corner office at the investment firm for the last fifteen years, answered. &#x201c;Adrienne?&#x201d; Madeline said as the garage door rumbled open. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Madeline. Can you put me through to Steve?&#x201d;</p><p>There was a silence on the other end as Madeline yanked open the car door.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; Madeline said. &#x201c;I hate to be short, but it&#x2019;s an emergency. Edna is at St. Joseph&#x2019;s again and I need Steve to meet me there.&#x201d;</p><p>Madeline slid behind the steering wheel, wedged the phone between her ear and shoulder, and put the minivan in reverse.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you try his cell phone?&#x201d; Adrienne&#x2019;s tone was uncharacteristically tentative.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Maddie began to back down the driveway, her mind swirling with details. How badly damaged was Edna&#x2019;s kitchen? Should she have Steve go to the hospital while she checked the house? &#x201c;It went right to voice mail. Isn&#x2019;t he in the office? Do you know how to reach him?&#x201d;</p><p>There was another odd pause and then Adrienne said, &#x201c;Steve doesn&#x2019;t work here anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>Madeline&#x2019;s foot found the brake of its own accord. The car jerked to a stop. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry? Where did you say he was?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know where he is, Madeline,&#x201d; the secretary said slowly. &#x201c;Steve doesn&#x2019;t work here anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>Madeline sat in the cul-de-sac, trying to absorb the words she&#x2019;d just heard.</p><p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen Steve since he was laid off. That was at the beginning of September. About six months ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Madeline drove to the hospital and then had no idea how she got there. Nothing registered, not the street signs or the lights or the bazillion other cars that must have flown by on Highway 400 or the artery off it that led to the hospital parking lot. The entire way she grappled with what Adrienne had told her and Steve had not. Laid off six months ago? Not working? Unemployed?</p><p>At the information desk, she signed in and made her way down the hall to Edna&#x2019;s room. There were people there and noise. A gurney rolled by. A maintenance worker mopped up a distant corner of the hallway. She sensed movement and activity, but the images and sounds were fleeting. Nothing could compete with the dialogue going on in her head. If Steve didn&#x2019;t have a job, where did he go every day after he put on his suit and strolled out the door with his briefcase? More important, why hadn&#x2019;t he told her?</p><p>In the doorway to her mother-in-law&#x2019;s room, Madeline paused to gat...</p></p><h2>A Stand at Sinai (The Promised Land)</h2><p>Jarah, Ezra, Ada, Eitan and all our other friends from <i>A Cry From Egypt</i> join us again in one of the most thrilling eras in history. <i>A Stand At Sinai</i> takes the Israelites from the crossing of the Red Sea, through battles with the Amalekites, an Israelite wedding (wonder who?), the giving of the Ten Commandments - and the temptation of the Golden Calf.</p><p>Hope Auer has been writing stories and plays since she was very young.

This book did even more than just entertain me. It challenged me. I've read the Exodus account many times. I know that the Isrealites were wandering in the desert for 40 years because of their grumbling and disbelief. I never thought through that fact, though. A Stand at Sinai made me look at the Exodus account in a completely different way. --Christi @ Through the Calm &amp; Through the Storm</p><h2>One Bowl Meals Cookbook</h2><p><b>Whether it&#x2019;s a rice bowl, grain bowl, salad bowl, vegetarian or made with seafood or meat, there&#x2019;s a simplicity and comfort in eating a full and balanced meal out of a bowl. <i>One Bowl Meals</i> will inspire readers to mix and match their favorite flavors and foods to create simple, satisfying meals.&nbsp;</b><br><br>In this compact yet comprehensive cookbook, the expert chefs at the Williams Sonoma Test Kitchen show&nbsp;how varied bowl meals can be.

No, not board games; the agile dinosaurs are now competing on surfboards, skateboards, and snowboards, as hordes of loyal fans fill the stands. <strong>Well suited to the series' audience, the book's rhymed couplets and digital illustrations capture the energy and excitement of sports competitions.</strong> Wheeler uses plenty of X Games jargon in the text and even includes one classical reference: 'He waves to fans and lifts his board. / He came.

In baseball, one dynasty was the story during the decade. The New York Yankees played in eight World Series from 1950 to 1959, winning six of them. Yankees icon Joe DiMaggio retired following the 1951 season, but a new super star, Mickey Mantle, took over in Yankee Stadium&#x2019;s center field in 1952. Mantle, the powerful switch-hitter who blasted tape-measure home runs and was often tortured by leg ailments, became the number one box office draw in baseball. He was the American League&#x2019;s most valuable player in 1956 and 1957, putting together a triple crown season in 1956. Mantle came into baseball when television was just catching on, and with the Yankees reaching the World Series and appearing on national TV seemingly every season, he became the face of the game during the decade. Mantle joined with his pals, pitcher Whitey Ford and infielder Billy Martin, to form a hard-partying trio that would be a joy and a pain to management. The author of several books on the Yankees, David Fischer brings expertise and a knack for great story-telling to the saga of the most dominant decade in the annals of sport, set during a defining moment in U.S. history.</p><p>David Fischer has written for The New York Times and Sports Illustrated For Kids and has worked at Sports Illustrated, National Sports Daily, and NBC Sports. He is the author of several sports titles, including Aaron Judge: The Incredible Story of the New York Yankees&#x2019; Home Run-Hitting Phenom; Derek Jeter #2: Thanks for the Memories, and Miracle Moments in New York Yankees History. Fischer is also the editor of Facing Mariano Rivera. He resides in New Jersey.The 50's was the decade when America discovered television and television discovered the Yankees. What a time it was, and what great heroes the Yankees provided for a post-war nation with a Baby Boomer generation discovering the joy of baseball. David Fischer has rediscovered that time in this fine book, and that's a gift for us all. <br><br> (Marty Appel, author of Pinstripe Empire, Munson, and Casey Stengel)<br><br><br>It was baseball's last decade as America's unrivaled game--before the rise of the NFL and a calendar filled with world championships. It was the age when Major League baseball spread beyond the Mississippi River and the World Series meant everything. It was when the Yankees ruled, when schoolboys wanted to hit like Mickey and sportswriters labored to make sense of Casey. David Fischer gives the reader a box seat for the golden age.<br><br> (Randy Roberts, co-author of A Season in the Sun: The Rise of Mickey Mantle)<br><br>The Yankees dynasty was born with Babe Ruth in the 1920's and carried on through the 30's with Lou Gehrig and the 40's with Joe DiMaggio. In the 50's, pop culture produced two lasting legacies of the post-war era: rock 'n roll and the Yankees. The Bronx Bombers of the 50's brought us Mickey Mantle, and as TV sets popped up in households everywhere The Mick became as synonymous with 1950's America as Elvis. David Fischer's journey through this decade of Yankees dominance is perfect for fans of the Pinstripes both old and new. (Sweeny Murti, Yankees reporter, WFAN)</p><h2>Lark!

The Unseelie court has suffered for so long, and there are some who would not have it weakened further by an impure queen. My enemies grow in number every day. But they do not know what I am capable of. Nor, for that matter, do I. . . . <br><br><b><i>In </i>Seduced by Moonlight<i>, Laurell K. Hamilton brings the dark, erotic reign of the immortal fey to a startling new depth. Full of sensuality and the consuming anticipation of latent powers unleashed, this world of gods, shapeshifters, and immortal souls is unveiled in all of its supreme magnificence and its treacherous deceits. <br></i></b></p><p>The third novel in Laurell K. Hamilton's Meredith Gentry series, <i>Seduced by Moonlight</i> continues the story of Merry Gentry, a mortal Faerie princess hiding in L.A. Her aunt, the immortal and insane Queen of Air and Darkness, has ordered her to compete with her cousin, Prince Cel, in making a baby. Whoever produces a child first wins the throne of the Unseelie Court. But Merry still hasn't conceived--and that's not her only problem. Unknown assassins seek her life; her magical powers are becoming potent and uncontrollable; and her sadistic aunt has just commanded her to return to Faerie.<p> Readers tired of mild modern fairy-tales about nice, polite elves may want to explore the Meredith Gentry series, which remembers that Faerie was originally a dark, dangerous realm of sex and violence. Hamilton's Queen of Air and Darkness is a vicious killer and torturer, and many of her fay drink blood or practice kinky sex (or both). Under royal orders to bed many males, Merry is far from averse; she and several lovers hit the bedroom on page 8 of <i>Seduced by Moonlight</i> and don't emerge until page 175. There's no shortage of sex, but not as much as the page count may indicate; the characters like to talk and sulk even more than they like to fornicate. The large cast and complicated backstory make this book the wrong starting point; newcomers should begin with the first novel, <i>A Kiss of Shadows</i>. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><b>Laurell K.

It argues that womanist biblical interpretation is not simply a byproduct of feminist biblical interpretation but part of a distinctive tradition of African American women's engagement with biblical texts. While womanist biblical interpretation is relatively new in the development of academic biblical studies, African American women are not newcomers to biblical interpretation.</p><p>Written in an accessible style, this volume highlights the importance of both the Bible and race in the development of feminism and the emergence of womanism. It provides a history of feminist biblical interpretation and discusses the current state of womanist biblical interpretation as well as critical issues related to its development and future. Although some African American women identify themselves as "womanists," the term, its usage, its features, and its connection to feminism remain widely misunderstood. This excellent textbook is perfect for helping to introduce readers to the development and applications of womanist biblical interpretation. </p></p><p><p><b>Nyasha Junior</b> is Assistant Professor of Hebrew Bible at Temple University.

More than that, Junior dispels common misconceptions and offers a cultural and intellectual history of African American women's engagement with biblical texts.

His love and power have no limits-and that's a message readers from all walks of life need to hear. The modern miracles that Rolland and Heidi Baker experience every day in their work with Mozambique's throwaway children, movingly chronicled in Always Enough, will inspire anyone looking for hope in the midst of suffering. <br> The Bakers, formerly missionaries in Indonesia and Hong Kong, share how their work for the past eight years in Mozambique, one of the poorest nations on earth, has borne spiritual fruit beyond their wildest dreams. Every day presents multiple impossible needs. But in the face of everything Satan can do, as Rolland and Heidi lay down their lives and "minister to the one," there is always enough. <br> Readers will discover that the simple practice of choosing to step out and trust God every day unleashes his provision for every need.</p><p>Is God still in the business of miracles? Does He still multiply food, send financial resources where there were none, heal the sick, even raise the dead?<br><br><i>Always Enough </i>shows that all of these things, and more, happen today as they did in biblical times. Even the most desperate poverty, the most devastating illness and the most heart-wrenching grief are not beyond His help. As you follow the adventures of missionaries Rolland and Heidi Baker in Mozambique-ravaged by civil war and famine to become one of the poorest places on earth-you'll be awed by God's limitless power and tender provision. The account of how He has enabled the Bakers to help many hundreds of Mozambique's throwaway children and start an astounding five thousand churches will warm your heart and move you to tears.<br><br>The simple practice of "ministering to the one" and choosing to trust God daily unleashes great power to change any situation.

Above all, style begins with a sense of who you are and your self-confidence. Style comes from opening yourself to the world around you -- to books and movies, art, music, travel, and especially to other people. <br> In this upbeat and engaging book, designer Kate Spade talks about the many people and experiences that have inspired her. For Kate, movies as varied as <i>The Swimmer</i> and <i>The Red Balloon</i> have influenced her vision of style, as have such places as Mexico (where she and her husband, Andy, vacation each year), Napa Valley, and her hometown of Kansas City. <br> In the pages of <i>Style,</i> you'll find a large section devoted to the colors Kate most loves and suggestions for combining them. Accessories, which are the backbone of her wardrobe, are given full treatment here, including shoes, handbags, hats, gloves, and jewelry; and a portfolio of Kate's personal favorites from her own closet is showcased. Style in the office, evening style, even ideas for style when you travel and when you play are all featured here. The last section of <i>Style</i> focuses on maintaining your wardrobe, including tips on organizing your closet, caring for vintage clothes, and keeping your jewelry in good condition. <br> <i>Style,</i> with 230 watercolor illustrations, is a wonderfully personal and friendly book intended for readers of all ages and style temperaments. If there's one rule Kate espouses, it's that true style comes when you follow your own rules. Moreover, as the writers William Strunk, Jr., and E. B. White once wrote, "To achieve style, begin by affecting none."</p><p>Back in 1993, editor-turned-designer Kate Spade made a splash in the fashion world by turning out a small collection of boxy, utilitarian handbags, each elegantly accented with her name stitched in discreet, lowercase letters. As a result, the simplicity and unabashed refinement of the Spade moniker on those Lilliputian labels has come to define the very foundation on which the designer has since built a fashion empire, one that now, in addition to handbags, includes shoes, clothing, and smart home things, all of which embody the Spade formula of timeless style--a seamless merging of cheerful colors, clean shapes, and well-chosen embellishments. Not bad for a Kansas City-born girl who used to comb vintage stores for fun. Having perfected and expertly marketed her own brand of personal style (one that has famously been counterfeited throughout the world), the designer has emerged with an equally elegant trio of books whose topics Spade has become a virtual authority: <i>Style</i>, <i>Occasions</i>, and <i>Manners</i>. <p> The packaging, as well as the neatly clipped advice found in <i>Style</i>, is as polished and sunny as the pert designer herself. Spade draws pearls of wisdom from fashion greats like Diana Vreeland and Coco Chanel, and also employs the inspiration of iconic films, books, artists, and design movements. The layout and typography, while vibrant, can be overwhelming at times and her suggestions a bit old-fashioned ("...if you have to wiggle into something, assume it won't flatter you."). But <i>Style</i> still stands out as a treasure in itself. From "forever" clothes like full skirts and jewel-neck sweaters to playing around with color combinations and cocktail rings, Spade has captured a place for herself in the modern fashion vernacular. And <i>Style</i> is a suitably chic way to celebrate her arrival. <i>--Christene Barberich</i></p>Kate Spade grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. After graduation she went to Mademoiselle magazine and became senior fashion editor/head of accessories before leaving in 1991. In 1993 she and her boyfriend, now husband, Andy Spade launched kate spade handbags, which has grown exponentially over the past decade and has established Kate Spade as a style icon.</p><h2>The Heir: A Duke&#39;s Heir, a Lady with a Secret, and a Riveting Regency Romance (The Windhams: The Duke&#39;s Obsession, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>Enter the lush, vibrant Regency world of the Windham family in this reissue of <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Grace Burrowes' beloved debut novel</strong></p><p>An earl who can't be bribed<br>A lady who can't be protected</p><p>Gayle Windham, Earl of Westhaven, is the dutiful heir to the Duke of Moreland.

After leaving university to study painting, he worked on scenes of contemporary life in Amsterdam that soon demonstrated his mastery of light and shade, as well as his rich sense of colour. Quickly becoming established as a giant in the art world, he was equally skilled at producing etchings, portraits, self-portraits, landscapes and drawings. </td></tr><tr><td>Although successful in his work, Rembrandt's personal life was marred by sadness; three of his four children died young, as did his wife, in 1642. In the same year, he painted The Night Watch, a brilliant work depicting city guardsmen and capturing the vitality, movement and personality of each person. Despite his enormous success, Rembrandt lived beyond his means and had to resort to auctioning his house at 4 Jodenbreestraat and its contents to pay his debts. However, he continued painting, and to this day still inspires younger artists and admirers all over the world. </td></tr><tr><td>The first part of this richly illustrated volume explores Rembrandt's early life in Leiden in The Netherlands, his friends and family, his education and relationships, and his attempt at bringing up his own family. From his birth in 1606, it details the progression of his prodigious talent, his mastery of chiaroscuro and his amazing artistic skill. This volume presents shows many drawings and etchings, including some that illustrated stories in the Bible; several were large, dramatic canvases in the elaborate Baroque style.</td></tr><tr><td>Rembrandt was fascinated by the work of many Italian artists, especially Caravaggio, whose new Baroque style inspired and influenced many young painters. Caravaggio's disciples became known as the "Caravaggisti". Some hint of this style is seen in Rembrandt's grand Biblical scenes, such as Moses Smashes the Tablets of the Law or Return of the Prodigal Son. Rembrandt's achievements and influences are traced through his life story, through archive and contemporary images and through examples of his paintings. </td></tr><tr><td>In the second part of the book, a comprehensive gallery shows more than 300 significant works of Rembrandt, from The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp, 1632 and The Holy Family, c.1645, to Self Portrait with Two Circles, c.1665-9 and The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, 1633. These wonderful paintings are accompanied by an informed description of each painting or drawing, the techniques used, and their context in the artistï¿½s life and body of work as a whole.</td></tr><tr><td>This beautiful volume is indispensable for anyone who wants to learn more about this intriguing artist and to enjoy looking at hundreds of his most iconic works in one glorious collection. </td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td>An expert and in-depth reference book on the life and works of the influential Dutch painter and etcher, Rembrandt van Rijn</td></tr><tr><td>A fascinating biography explores his early years, his personal life and the historical context of the early 17th century </td></tr><tr><td>Describes his creative progress and the artistic influences that led him to develop his art from the grand Baroque to a less exuberant style </td></tr><tr><td>Includes a stunning gallery of all his greatest and most significant works, with expert analysis of his style and technique</td></tr><tr><td>Beautifully illustrated with 500 reproductions of paintings and drawings</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>Rosalind Ormiston is an independent art historian.

The Virtuous Leadership approach to temperament affirms the legitimate diversity of our physiological and psychological makeup, and proposes that temperament, rightly understood, undergirds the efforts of all persons to flourish and achieve excellence. It recognizes that temperament does not determine goals (much less outcomes), but instead gives shape and color to the efforts of human beings to flourish through mastering the habits of excellence. In doing so, the habits of excellence - the virtues - become second-nature to us, part and parcel of our very selves. And thus, we ascend from temperament to character, and are no longer slaves to our natural inclinations but have achieved self-mastery in true human freedom.

You'll learn how to: <ul> <li><strong>research</strong> a student's use of skills through questions and observations </li> <li><strong>compliment</strong> to support and build upon successes </li> <li><strong>follow up</strong> on prior instruction for accountability and depth of understanding </li> <li><strong>explain </strong>a reading strategy by providing an explicit purpose and context </li> <li><strong>model</strong> the strategy to make the invisible brainwork of reading more visible </li> <li><strong>guide </strong>a readerinpracticing the strategy </li> <li><strong>link </strong>the strategy to independent reading. </li> </ul> <em>Conferring with Readers</em> presents repeatable frameworks for conferences that focus on six specific purposes of reading instruction: <ul> <li>matching students to just-right books </li> <li>reinforcing students' strengths </li> <li>supporting students during whole-class studies </li> <li>helping students move from one reading level to the next </li> <li>holding students accountable for previous learning </li> <li>deepening students' conversations about books in order to deepen their thinking. </li> </ul> What's more, each purpose is bolstered by an appendix of conference transcripts that support your teaching. With all this plus ideas for planning instruction, keeping records of your conferences, and even conducting group sessions, <em>Conferring with Readers</em> will make a big difference in how you teach reading-helping you feel confident and well equipped to foster each student's growth and independence as a reader.</p><p><p>Gravity Goldberg is coauthor of the Heinemann title Conferring with Readers (2007).

Students will see how the various major religions are practiced today, how religion shapes modern human behavior, and how each religious tradition considered is at work in the world today. <br><br>The six major religious traditions discussed in this book are:<br>ï¿½Hindu <br><br>ï¿½Buddhist <br><br>ï¿½Jewish <br><br>ï¿½Christian <br><br>ï¿½Islam <br><br>ï¿½Chinese<br><br>Also discussed are:<br><br>ï¿½Sikhism <br><br>ï¿½Jainism <br><br>ï¿½Bahï¿½'ï¿½ <br><br>ï¿½Shinto<br><br>Each of the six chapters on the major traditions serves as a short refresher course in the tradition, covering the history and general beliefs of the tradition, the tradition's approach to ethics and morality, what is sacred to each tradition, and how each communicates moral beliefs, principles, and practices. Each chapter concludes with discussion questions and suggestions for further study.</p><p>"Why do they do that?"<br><br>Ignorance of religious and moral traditions beyond one's own inspires in many people misunderstanding and even fear. The question extends beyond matters of religious practice to what motivates people's actions. In Moral Traditions: An Introduction to World Religious Ethics, Mari Rapela Heidt discusses the moral traditions and ethical teachings of six key religious traditions, Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Christian, Islamic, and Chinese, As well as the possibly less familiar Sikh, Jain, Bahï¿½'ï¿½, and Shinto.<br><br> While one may act morally without being religious, religion is a powerful influence on human behavior. Learning about the history, art, and major beliefs of the world's many religious traditions is a good start but does not go far enough. One also needs to understand how those beliefs translate into human actions, and how one's own actions toward others are perceived. Misunderstandings of human actions breed<br><br>division and distrust, making this study of the moral underpinnings of the different religious traditions essential reading.<br><br> Moral Traditions: An Introduction to World Religious Ethics is a book that will both satisfy students' initial curiosity and spark in them an interest in learning more about the world's great religions, their ethical teachings and moral traditions.<br><br></p><h2>Training for Sudden Violence: 72 Practice Drills</h2><p><strong>USA Best Books Award WINNER - 2016</strong>The speed and brutality of apredatory attack can shock even an experienced martial artist.

That makes it the instructor's responsibility to make each and every student as competent as possible as quickly as possible. In Drills Rory Miller gives exercises and training philosophy that serve this goal. Some of the drills are mental, because the author recognizes that survival is not just a physical problem. Some are simple, things you can do right now. Some, like scenarios, are on the leading edge of current professional training. There's a lot in this book, and no fluff.

The tree asks the girl why she is crying, and she tells him that the other children in her village are mean to her despite her kindness. They mock her appearance, glasses, speech, and intelligence. In an effort to cheer her up, the tree tells her his own history. Once the other trees teased him for being different, but when loggers came to the forest, they cut down all of the other trees. Being different saved the curvy tree. He was lonely but eventually grew tall enough that he could see other curvy trees in distant forests. From his branches, the girl sees the other trees, and in each one there is a child like her. The tree teaches her that life will improve as she grows and looks outward.

Satire pervades Scripture. Satire treats the foibles of sinners with a less than perfect tenderness. But if a Christian employs satire today, he is almost immediately called to account for his "insensitive" and "unloving" behavior.

When Christ was confronted with ecclesiastical obstinacy and other forms of arrogance, He showed us a godly pattern for giving offense.<p></p><p>In every controversy godliness and wisdom (or the lack of them) are to be determined by careful appeal to the Scriptures and not the fact of people having taken offense.</p><p></p><p>In this book, veteran satirist Douglas Wilson explains his rationale for why so much of what he says gets people upset and yet he continues to speak as he does, for the sake of the gospel.</p></p><p><b>Douglas Wilson</b> is a Senior Fellow of theology at New Saint Andrews College.

Except for the futon he slept on and a teak wood desk, the pale, spacious room was empty. Hiroshi Matsumoto breathed in the grassy fragrance of the <em>tatami</em> mats, the sweet and stirring February air; his thoughts wandering to the cherry blossoms that would soon be poised like flakes of snow upon their branches. The trees that lined the streets of Yanaka, would be in full bloom, and the labyrinth of narrow alleyways would swarm with tourists stopping to admire the Japanese quince, daffodils, and blue triplet lilies blossoming in flower boxes that crowded the teeming walkways. As boys, he and his brother Kenji pushed single-file past the old wood and stone houses to the park. Now, there were few of the old buildings left, long since replaced by brick and concrete. Despite the sharp edge of memories that stabbed just below his ribcage, he still loved this season best, just as Aki always had &#x2014; the doorway to spring &#x2014; each morning gleaming with new possibilities. <br><br>Almost twenty years ago, his youthful agility had rekindled a national passion for sumo wrestling. In a country devastated by atomic bombs that flattened cities and scarred their spirit, Hiroshi&#x2019;s speed and strength helped to revive the pride of his nation with every victory. He could barely contain the joy he felt when at last he climbed the ranks. Not until he found courage enough to touch with two fingers the nape of his wife Aki&#x2019;s neck did any thrill ever match it.<br><br>Hiroshi pushed off his covers and stretched his body the full length of his extra large futon, his muscular girth still impressive at his age. He had always valued strength and speed more than some other <em>rikishi</em>, sumo wrestlers who gained inordinate amounts of weight to dominate a match by their size. At thirty-seven, he was a good deal older, and at six-foot one, over a hundred pounds lighter than the heaviest wrestlers, who weighed in at four hundred pounds. Hiroshi sat up and fingered the faint rise of a scar that ran along his hairline and ended at his right temple, then rubbed his belly and pushed his rough feet to the edge of the futon, his calluses a souvenir of barefoot practice on dirt and wooden floors. So many years, he thought to himself, and he touched for luck the soles of his feet, first the left, then the right, as he did every morning. As Hiroshi heaved himself up from the futon and reached for his kimono, he felt again that first step onto the <em>dohyo.</em> The smooth, sacred clay surface of the elevated straw ring was a blessing after years of discipline, training, and rituals. The scratching of his bare feet on the <em>tatami</em> mats made a sad insect sound, not unlike the swish of salt thrown down on the ring to drive out the evil spirits. <br><br>Competition had been a strong and potent drug. Everyone and everything disappeared as soon as he entered the ring, as if his life had simmered down to that very moment in time and nothing else mattered. Nothing and everything. He wondered once more if it had all been worthwhile &#x2014; the sacrifice of family, friends, and lovers for a sport. And only now, too late, could he see the cost of it all as Aki&#x2019;s accusing stare flashed through his mind.<br><br>A sharp knock on the <em>shoji</em> door brought him out of his reverie. He quickly tightened the sash of his <em>yukata</em> kimono, and grunted permission to enter. <br><br>The door slid open. It was Haru, dressed in a dark blue padded kimono with a pattern of white cranes. It looked new, yet strangely familiar to him, as if Aki had once worn one similar to it. It was Haru who had first introduced him to her sister, a lifetime ago. Aki was the most beautiful girl he&#x2019;d ever seen &#x2014; her clear, milky-white skin, the smooth, sharp curve of her chin, her hidden fragility. Haru&#x2019;s movements were quick and definite, her 0.dark eyes as intense and intelligent as they always were. Every morning, no matter the weather, she was out walking in the garden with his six-year old daughter. And though Takara shared her mother&#x2019;s classic beauty, he saw Haru&#x2019;s strength emerging more and more in her each day. <br><br>Haru bowed. "We&#x2019;ll be leaving for the stadium soon," she said. "Kenji-<em>san</em> is coming for us after he picks up your <em>obachan</em>." <br><br>He watched Haru&#x2019;s poised figure and the same straight nose and thin, crescent moon eyebrows that graced both sisters. They would all be there at his retirement ceremony, his grandmother, brother, Haru and Takara. "<em>Hai</em>," he said, swallowing. <br><br>She moved across the room to slide open the <em>shoji</em> windows, admitting a cool breeze from the west. It filled the room with a sudden breath of promise. He cleared his throat but said nothing.<br><br>Instead, it was Haru who spoke, as she looked out at his acre of blossoming <em>sakura</em> trees. "A day of no regrets," she said, as if reading his thoughts. <br><br>And suddenly, something tender and inconsolable gripped his chest, an entire life boiled down to these last hours. He rubbed his eyes and nodded, always amazed at her astuteness. "What do you see?" he asked.<br><br>Haru turned to him again. "Such beauty..." she began, without finishing her sentence...</p></p><h2>Buttermilk Basin&#39;s Vintage Vibe: 25 Patterns with a Retro Feel</h2><p><p>Turn back the clock and experience a little nostalgia as you stitch something new to enjoy in the present--the Buttermilk Basin way!

Halivni, Auschwitz survivor and one of the greatest Talmudic scholars of the past century, declares that at this time of God's near absence, Jews can still observe the words of the Torah and pray for God to come near again. Jews must continue to study the classic texts of rabbinic Judaism but now with greater humility, recognizing that even the greatest religious leaders and thinkers interpret these texts only as mere people, prone to human error. <i>Breaking the Tablets</i> is important reading for anyone who feels burdened by the question of how it is possible to believe in God and practice their religion.</p><p><b>David Weiss Halivni</b> is Professor Emeritus of Classical Jewish Civilization at Columbia University. Halivni survived the concentration camps of Auschwitz, Wolfsberg, and Mathausen&#x2015;his entire family was murdered in the camps. Most widely known for his scholarly commentary on the Talmud, Halivni has also written a series of more general studies of the classic rabbinic literature that remains the foundation for all contemporary forms of Judaism. <br><br>Rabbi Halivni was awarded The Israel Prize in Talmud, this year. The Israel Prize, the highest honor in Israel, will be awarded on Israel Independence Day, observed this year on May 8.<br><br><b>Peter Ochs</b> is professor of Modern Judaic Studies at the University of Virginia.Erudition, scholarship, depth of knowledge, sharp insight, brilliant commentary and innovative interpretation: all these are to be found in David Weiss Halivni's new volume on the Talmud&#x2015;a field in which he has been recognized as one of this generation's great Masters. (Elie Wiesel)<br><br>This is a deep, powerful book. Halivni's achievement is awe-inspiring: he came through Auschwitz as a young man, then became one of the leading Jewish scholars in the world. In these essays he points to a way of spiritual and intellectual renewal for Judaism that has lessons for other faiths too. His combination of great learning, passionate prayer, and prophetic daring connects Sinai to Auschwitz and opens a way into the twenty-first century that is prayerful and faithful, yet realistic. He has an ideal editor and interpreter in Peter Ochs, whose comments and drawing out of implications can even at times articulate Halivni's message better than Halivni himself. Halivni and Ochs together are a sign of hope for academy, synagogue and civilization. (David Ford, professor of divinity, University of Cambridge)<br><br>With profound insight, the greatest rabbinic scholar living today explicates for us some of the faith, hope, and intelligence that has kept and still keeps his soul from succumbing to the Shoah, which is his greatest agony, the greatest agony of our people and, indeed, the greatest agony in human history. He has done this by showing that his scholarly attempt to retrieve the original meaning of classical Jewish texts, which were written at times when God was closer, works in tandem with his continuing hope and prayer for the return to the world of the God who was absent in Auschwitz. This latest explication of his Jewish theology is considerably aided by the excellent interpretations it has elicited from Professor Peter Ochs. (David Novak, University of Toronto)<br><br>This small volume has been skillfully edited....Halvini [and Ochs] give us much to reflect on and ponder. (<i>Jewish Book World</i>)<br><br>Halivni speaks with the authority of scholarly erudition, life experience, and longing for the restoration of both Torah and God's nearness. . . . His passion and authenticity are deeply moving.... <i>Breaking the Tablets</i> is a careful and imaginative tracing in rabbinic literature ... it is a significant contribution to post-Shoah theology. (Laurence Edwards <i>CCAR Journal: The Reform Jewish Quarterly</i>)<br><br>In these profound meditations on the future of Torah and Jewish theology, ably edited and explicated by Peter Ochs, David Weiss Halivni proposes how the gap between divine revelation at Sinai and divine absence at Auschwitz can and must be bridged. (Judith R. Baskin, University of Oregon)<br><br>When Holocaust survivor and renowned Talmudist David Weiss Halivni writes a work of theology dealing with the question of God and the Holocaust, attention is merited. When he writes a work that is traditional and radical, at once personal and philosophical, one's interest deepens.

And what would a John Coltrane look like now, or are we wrong to be looking for such a figure?<br>From the outside, one keeps wondering which musician will take the next decisively evolutionary step, as all those who seem to be candidates repeat themselves, become hermetic or obvious, fail to write compelling original material, sell out in some form, or begin to bore their audiences. And then one wonders whether evolutionary models should be applied to jazz at all. It seems to be the case that jazz loops around, retrenches, makes tiny adjustments that don&#x2019;t alter the basic language. The problem, though, is that Coltrane certainly made it seem as if jazz were evolving. He barreled ahead, and others followed. Some are still following.<br>His career, especially the last ten years of it, was so unreasonably exceptional that when he became seen as the representative jazz musician, the general comprehension of how and why jazz works became changed; it also became jagged and dangerous with half-truths. Every half-truth needs a full explanation.<br>This is not a book about Coltrane&#x2019;s life, but the story of his work. The first part tells the story of his music as it was made, from his first recordings as a no-name navy bandsman in 1946 until his death as a near-saint of jazz in 1967. The second part tells the story of his influence, starting in his lifetime and continuing until today. The reason that the two stories are separated&#x2014;even though one will cross over into the other&#x2019;s territory now and then&#x2014;is because the work and its reception have had distinct, different, and individually logical lives.<br>This is a book about jazz as sound. I mean &#x201c;sound&#x201d; as it has long functioned among jazz players, as a mystical term of art: as in, every musician finally needs a sound, a full and sensible embodiment of his artistic personality, such that it can be heard, at best, in a single note. Miles Davis&#x2019;s was fragile and pointed. Coleman Hawkins&#x2019;s was ripe and mellow and generous. John Coltrane&#x2019;s was large and dry, slightly undercooked, and urgent.<br>But I also mean sound as a balanced block of music emanating from a whole band. How important is this? With Coltrane, sound ruled over everything. It eventually superseded composition: his later records present one track after another of increasing similarity, in which the search for sound superseded solos and structure. His authoritative sound, especially as he could handle it in a ballad, was the reason older musicians respected him so&#x2014;his high-register sound, for example, in &#x201c;Say It Over and Over Again.&#x201d; But it was also the reason younger and less formally adept musicians were drawn to him, and why they could even find themselves a place on his bandstand.<br>Coltrane loved structure in music, and the science and theory of harmony; one of the ways he is remembered is as the champion student of jazz. But insofar as Coltrane&#x2019;s music has some extraordinary properties&#x2014;the power to make you change your consciousness a little bit&#x2014;we ought to widen the focus beyond the constructs of his music, his compositions, and his intellectual conceits. Eventually we can come around to the music&#x2019;s overall sound: first how it feels in the ear and later how it feels in the memory, as mass and as metaphor. Musical structure, for instance, can&#x2019;t contain morality. But sound, somehow, can. Coltrane&#x2019;s large, direct, vibratoless sound transmitted his basic desire: &#x201c;that I&#x2019;m supposed to grow to the best good that I can get to.&#x201d;<br>What Coltrane accomplished, and how he connected with audiences for jazz around the world, seems to elude any possible career plan, and is remarkably separate from what we have come to understand as European-based, Western-culture artistic consciousness. This book attempts to track the connections of his work&#x2014;how and why he proceeded from A to B to Z&#x2014;and then, later, to ask why Coltrane has weighed so heavily in the basic identity of jazz for the last half century.<br>Coltrane&#x2014;whose music is marked by remarkable technique, strength in all registers of the tenor and soprano saxophones, slightly sharp intonation, serene intensity, and a rapid, mobile exploration of chords, not just melody&#x2014;made jazz that was alternately seductive, mainstream, and antagonistic. Among his recordings were the high-speed harmonic ï¿½tude &#x201c;Giant Steps&#x201d; (1959); the exotic, ancient-sounding modal versions of &#x201c;My Favorite Things&#x201d; (1960) and &#x201c;Greensleeves&#x201d; (1961); the headlong, sometimes discordant, fifteen-minute blues in F, &#x201c;Chasin&#x2019; the Trane&#x201d; (1961); the devotional suite A Love Supreme (1964); the mournful ballads &#x201c;Soul Eyes&#x201d; (1962) and &#x201c;After the Rain&#x201d; (1963); and the whirligig free-jazz duet performance with drums alone, Interstellar Space (1967).<br>His work became unofficially annexed by the civil rights movement: its sound alone has become a metaphor for dignified perseverance. His art, nearly up to the end, was not insular, and kept signifying different things for different people of different cultures and races. His ugliest music (to a certain way of thinking) is widely suspected of possessing beauty beyond the listener&#x2019;s grasp, and the reverse goes for his prettiest music&#x2014;that it is more properly understood as an expression of grave seriousness. There is more poetry written about him, I would guess, than about any other jazz musician. And his religious quests through Christianity, Buddhism, Kabbalah, and Sufism are now embedded, ex post facto, in his music. In pluralistic America, it has become hard not to hear Coltrane&#x2019;s modal music&#x2014;in which an improviser, freed from chordal movement, becomes free to explore&#x2014;as a metaphor for a personal religious search.<br>Coltrane, particularly from 1961 to 1964, sounds like the thing we know as modern jazz, just the way that Stravinsky sounds like the thing we know as modern classical music. Young bandleaders, especially saxophonists, find him a safe place, the safe place. Some musicians may disagree on the basis of their own experiences&#x2014;jazz is hundreds of microclimates&#x2014;but here it is: the sound of so many jazz gigs I&#x2019;ve heard in the past fifteen years, as a jazz critic in New York, is usually the sound of albums like Coltrane&#x2019;s Sound or Coltrane Plays the Blues, the Coltrane quartet just before or in the first stages of a modal-jazz style, just tightening, still before A Love Supreme and that later music that is so personal that to borrow from it would be obvious. (Not that it isn&#x2019;t sometimes borrowed from, and not that such borrowing isn&#x2019;t usually obvious to the point of vulgarity.) He has been more widely imitated in jazz over the last fifty years than any other figure.<br>Some musicians have told me that after a period of immersion, they could not listen to him anymore. Listeners, too. I have played other kinds of music in bands, and studied with a jazz pianist, but I am a writer, not a jazz musician. When I first heard Coltrane&#x2019;s records as a teenager in the 1980s, the 1956 Prestige sessions with the Miles Davis Quintet&#x2014;&#x201c;Tune Up&#x201d; and &#x201c;If I Were a Bell&#x201d; especially&#x2014;he sounded to me like a great lake whose dimensions I knew I wanted to trace. Next was Giant Steps, with its brightness, concision, harmonic acuity, and strong original melodies. It did me no harm&#x2014;not until later, when I began to hear a rote mathematical stiffness in his playing that I reacted against. I wasn&#x2019;t alive in the early sixties, and perhaps for that reason The European Tour, a double-LP set of Coltrane&#x2019;s band recorded live in 1962 and 1963, first seemed to me the stylization of modal music, a soft, snake-charming lob toward the progressive, self-congratulating audiences accruing around Coltrane after his radio hit, &#x201c;My Favorite Things.&#x201d; I rejected it, pretty much.<br>But when I got to Live at the Village Vanguard, particularly the track &#x201c;Spiritual,&#x201d; I developed a block against it. This music was no half-stepping: deep and correct and serious, harder and more violently swinging and slightly ancient-sounding, the intimations of Coltrane&#x2019;s modal style before it hardened as a gesture. This band was the supreme consortium of live jazz, the one most related to jazz-as-it-is-currently-played. It seemed that you could go in there and not be able to find your way out.<br>I did have some sort of index for seriousness in jazz at that point. I was hearing a lot of music in New York that tried to be profound and occasionally was. The guitarist Sonny Sharrock and his loud band with two drummers made sense to me by its natural connections both to rock-and-roll and post-Coltrane free jazz - specifically to Pharoah Sanders&#x2019;s records of the late 1960s. The tenor saxophonist Charles Gayle and his trios played a kind of highly expressionistic collective improvisation, whose main factors were its manipulation of rhythmic chaos and the unpredictable charisma of Gayle himself. Another tenor player, David S. Ware, led a quartet which took the example of Coltrane in about 1965 to the next plane of loud-and-lugubrious; it was all density. On the other hand, David Murray&#x2019;s trio with Wilber Morris and Andrew Cyrille was more spindly and playful and pretty, with nice original lines, and a completely different story from Coltrane&#x2019;s. (Murray&#x2019;s allegiance was to melodic improvisation, the Sonny Rollins line of playing, as opposed to Coltrane&#x2019;s way of implying whole chords in his sweep.)<br>But those Coltrane records I shrank from faced up to the idea of density and noise without fetishizing it, and didn&#x2019;t stop there. Coltrane connected his own learned harmonic patterns with many outside approaches, picked up from other jazz musicians and various folk cultures&#x2014;a thoroughly willed, nearly maniacal method of inclusion. And he built a groove with his bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones that grew stronger, even as the rest of the music became heavy with super-extended soloing, the overload of individual will. The various sounds of Live at the Village Vanguard became some of jazz&#x2019;s most revisited majority languages, connecting schools of players who would otherwise have little to do with each other, formalists and non-formalists.<br>Anyway, two years went by before I tried listening seriously to Coltrane again. Now it was twenty-eight years after Live at the Village Vanguard was recorded, and the bohemian interior of the jazz audience in New York had become, as far as I could see, smaller and more self-conscious. Jazz&#x2019;s early-sixties identity as protest material for Americans who had a hard, bitter road out of the Great Society had since been celebrated, fetishized, and nostalgized; since the beginning of the 1980s, the music-as-music had been studied as an academic subject. Jazz, too, had crept into pop and hiphop. And a jazz-classicism movement, which exercised withering skepticism toward most of the loose-form and nonacoustic music that had happened in jazz after the mid-sixties, had gained fully funded legitimacy through house orchestras at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall and the Smithsonian.<br>The point I am making is that there were so many entryways to jazz by 1989 that I didn&#x2019;t necessarily want to deal with the most serious, uncomfortable, and perhaps necessary way in: immersion in John Coltrane&#x2019;s recordings. Part of that discomfort came from the fact that it had become totally unclear how to think of them. They form a path, but was it a path toward a new language or nonsense?<br>The trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, as well as his brothers Branford (the saxophonist) and Delfeayo (the trombonist), and the critic Stanley Crouch&#x2014;who wrote a great deal of combative opinions associated with them&#x2014;had become extremely potent cultural commentators by that point. Wynton was in the business of selecting what was good and lasting across the entire history of jazz. Serving as faction boss, he talked persuasively about what had been watered down or lost in jazz: four-four swing, ballads, constructive competition, a sense of boundaries and exclusivity. He really loved to argue, and the gist of his arguments was always responsibility: whether you are doing good or harm to the music. (And not just to jazz, but, by extension, to American culture.) He talked about jazz as if it were a patient on a table. He prescribed the necessary measures musicians ought to be taking if they wanted jazz to survive at all.<br>Suddenly the life&#x2019;s work of Coltrane, and his gradual trajectory toward non-swing, non-ballads, non-competiveness, non-boundaried inclusion, could seem dangerous. But the fact remained that if you could stand to listen, really listen hard, to &#x201c;Spiritual,&#x201d; or the rest of Live at the Village Vanguard, both sides of the argument seemed shallow, and imposed from without by parties with an agenda. A record like that one indicated that the common-room of jazz was also, paradoxically, its darkest and most mysterious place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Excerpted from Coltrane by Ben Ratliff.

As Climbing Leader of the famed 1996 Everest IMAX expedition led by David Breashears, Jamling Norgay was able to follow in the footsteps of his legendary mountaineer father, Tenzing Norgay, who with Sir Edmund Hillary was the first to reach the summit of Mount Everest, in 1953. Jamling Norgay interweaves the story of his own ascent during the infamous May 1996 Mount Everest disaster with little-known stories from his father's historic climb and the spiritual life of the Sherpas, revealing a fascinating and profound world that few -- even many who have made it to the top -- have ever seen.</p></p><p>In a spectacular and mesmerizing narrative, Jamling Tenzing Norgay, the climbing leader for the IMAX film expedition on Mount Everest, details the ill-fated 1996 summer climbing season (made famous by Jon Krakauer's <i> Into Thin Air</i>) and deftly weaves in the history, politics, triumphs, and tragedies of climbing the world's tallest mountain. Norgay knows Everest, and <i>Touching My Father's Soul</i> is a must-read for anyone contemplating a summit attempt, even if exclusively from the comfort of a favorite armchair.<p> Just because technological and meteorological advances have benefited later expeditions, newer isn't necessarily better; much wisdom can be gained from studying the mistakes and encounters of previous attempts. Anecdotes and gripping prose shine throughout, like this gem: "That night--and then the following night--we lay in our tents listening to the malevolent roar of wind high on the mountain. The train was still running, the 747 endlessly trying to take off." As a Sherpa and practicing Buddhist, Norgay flavors the book with his culture and its climbing rituals and carefully dissects the differences between the local, deep respect for their mountain--Chomolungma--and the nonnative brashness that has often led to disaster.</p><p> Norgay is intent on the accomplishments and experiences of his legendary father, Tenzing Norgay, the Sherpa who first reached the summit with Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953, and commendably shares his most private and human thoughts while retracing his father's greatest path. As <i>Touching My Father's Soul</i> acknowledges, however, no one conquers Everest. You sneak up on it, then get down as quick as you can. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p><p>Star of the IMAX movie Everest, which chronicled the tragic 1996 climb, and Climbing Leader of the IMAX Everest Expedition, Jamling Tenzing Norgay is the son of famed mountaineer Tenzing Norgay, the first to summit Everest, together with Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953. Norgay runs his family's travel adventure company, Tenzing Norgay Adventures, which teaches half a million climbers each year. Norgay is based in Darjeeling, India, when he is not climbing.</p></p><h2>Healing and Preventing Autism: A Complete Guide</h2><p><b>The must-have <i>New York Times</i> bestseller that tells you what to do now for a child with autism, ADD, ADHD, OCD, and other disorders </b> <br><br> For any child with challenges, early intervention is essential and parents need a plan that they can implement right away.

One tossed a rock into the dark opening of a cave, hoping to startle the wayward animal out of hiding. When the rock made contact, what the boys heard was not the muffled sound of a goat&#x2019;s bleat, a ricochet off a cave wall, or even a thump against the hard dusty ground. It was the sound of shattering pottery.<br><br>The boys ventured into the cave and discovered there in the Judean desert a cache of mysterious clay vessels stuffed with ancient Hebrew writing&#x2014;the first of what we&#x2019;ve come to know as the Dead Sea Scrolls. Hundreds of jars. Hundreds of scrolls. Thousands of words. Precious parchments rolled up and tucked into clay jars, only to be discovered in 1946, some two thousand years after they were penned. Over the next several years, fifteen thousand fragments were retrieved from eleven different caves.<br><br>A few years ago, a museum in my (Sharon&#x2019;s) hometown hosted a traveling exhibit of the Dead Sea Scrolls. I walked into the dimly lit room expecting to look at a piece of history, but I experienced so much more. God&#x2019;s presence was thick. The Holy Spirit hovered close to the writings He had breathed into the writers inspired centuries earlier. My soul was stirred.<br><br>Enshrined in glass cases surrounding me were precious ancient parchments. Below each fragment of Hebrew or Aramaic text, the English translations were provided&#x2014;translations that matched almost perfectly the words in my very own Bible. I was struck by the unchangeable authenticity of God&#x2019;s Word through the centuries. So far, more than 230 biblical texts have been found among the 972 manuscripts, representing every book except Esther. Here was Genesis. Psalms. Isaiah. Deuteronomy. Old friends. Holy words. Unscathed by time. Unchanged by man.<br><br>As I stared in awe at one particular scroll fragment from the book of Deuteronomy, I noticed four dots where the Hebrew letters for Yahweh should have appeared. Four dots. Then I saw it again in the book of Isaiah: &#x201c;In the wilderness prepare the way of ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½&#x201d; (Isaiah 40:3, esv).<br><br>And then it hit me just how deeply the scribes reverenced and revered the name YHWH. They wouldn&#x2019;t say the Name. They wouldn&#x2019;t even write the Name. And yet YHWH is the name that God said would be remembered from generation to generation (Exodus 3:15). And while God is exceedingly holy, He is also intimately personal. He reminded Moses, &#x201c;I am...the God of Abraham,...Isaac and ...Jacob&#x201d; (verse 6).<br><br>And, friend, He is the God of Sharon, Gwen, Mary&#x2014;and you!<br><br>Infinitely holy. Intimately personal. Our God wants not only to be worshiped but to be known. In 1 Chronicles 16:10&#x2013;11, David urged his people: <br>Glory in his holy name;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.<br>Look to the Lord and his strength;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seek his face always.<br><br><b>WHAT'S IN A NAME?<br></b><br>Of course, if we&#x2019;re to &#x201c;glory in his holy name,&#x201d; it makes sense that we&#x2019;ll need to know what that name is. In the Old Testament, the Israelites were surrounded by cultures that worshiped a variety of gods with many different names. However, the one true God made it clear that He alone is to receive our worship. &#x201c;Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one,&#x201d; the Shema begins (Deuteronomy 6:4). And while He is one God, He has many names.<br><br>In the sixty-six books of the Bible that were written over approximately fifteen hundred years, God revealed various names that reflect His multifaceted character and infinitely diverse ways. To the outcast Hagar, He was El Roi, the God Who Sees. To the needy Abraham, He was Yahweh Yireh, the Lord Will Provide. To the rock-toting teen warrior David, He was El Shaddai, the All-Sufficient One. In each of these instances, God revealed a new aspect of His being to show that He was sufficient to take care of every need, all powerful to take care of every foe, and all present to take care of every circumstance.<br><br>In ancient times names carried powerful significance. In addition to distinguishing one person from another and connecting family members, names were thought to reflect a person&#x2019;s character, nature, and destiny. Joseph&#x2019;s two sons were named Manasseh, meaning &#x201c;God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father&#x2019;s household,&#x201d; and Ephraim, meaning &#x201c;God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering&#x201d; (Genesis 41:50&#x2013;52). Abraham&#x2019;s name meant a &#x201c;father of many nations,&#x201d; and the name of his wife, Sarah, meant &#x201c;princess&#x2014;the mother of many nations&#x201d;1 (Genesis 17:5, 15&#x2013;16). Then there was Jacob, whose name meant &#x201c;trickster,&#x201d; Esau whose name meant &#x201c;red,&#x201d; and Jabez whose name meant &#x201c;pain.&#x201d; If you&#x2019;re familiar with their lives, you can see how these names are intricately connected with each person&#x2019;s story.<br><br>God has many names in the Bible, and just like the names of the people to whom He revealed Himself, each one brings to light something about His character and His ways&#x2014;who He is and what He does. Our finite human minds can barely comprehend even a fraction of the depth of His wisdom, the breadth of His love, the magnitude of His power, or the height of His grace. But like a multifaceted diamond, each name invites us to glory in a different aspect of our amazing God.<br><br><b>KNOWING GOD INTIMATELY<br></b><br>In the pages to follow, we&#x2019;ll introduce you to forty different names and attributes of God. But we don&#x2019;t want you to simply know God&#x2019;s names. We want you to know God Himself&#x2014;on a personal level. We want you to call Him by name and to call on Him by name.

I have called you by name; you are mine&#x201d; (Isaiah 43:1, nlt).<br><br>Our purpose is not to cover every name of God mentioned in the Bible or to study every theological nuance of the names we do cover. Rather, we long for you to draw closer to the heart of God by gaining new insights as to who God is and what He does on your behalf. We pray that as you reflect on the various names of God, you will experience Him in fresh ways and with deeper intimacy.<br><br>We hope you read our previous Girlfriends in God book, Trusting God. It&#x2019;s the perfect introduction to this study. These two books are knit together with the purpose of drawing you closer to God. We believe the more you know Him, the more you&#x2019;ll trust Him. Isaiah wrote, &#x201c;Let him who walks in the dark, who has no light, trust in the name of the Lord and rely on his God&#x201d; (Isaiah 50:10). The psalmist wrote, &#x201c;Those who know your name will trust in you, for you, Lord, have never forsaken those who seek you&#x201d; (Psalm 9:10). Oh, girlfriend, you can know God by name and you can trust Him.<br><br>For most of the names of God, we&#x2019;ll include the Old Testament Hebrew or Aramaic or the New Testament Greek rendering of the name as well as the English translation. Just as in our Girlfriends in God online devotions, we&#x2019;ll include Today&#x2019;s Truth&#x2014;a Bible verse in which the name is used. And each devotional closes with a prayer. For Day 6 of each week, we&#x2019;ve provided questions to help you reflect more deeply and personally on the five names or attributes covered in that particular week. We encourage you to gather a group of girlfriends into a GiG group and study the names together. We know from our own friendship that there&#x2019;s so much to be gained by sharing with one another what you&#x2019;re discovering about God. In fact, the three of us have created free online videos for each week, and we&#x2019;d love to join you in this study. So grab a cup of coffee, click on www.girlfriendsingod.com, and find us on the Knowing God by Name page.<br><br>So let&#x2019;s get started!

The book offers an in-depth exploration of the need for self-esteem, the nature of that need, the conditions of fulfillment, and how self-esteem (or lack of it) affects our values, responses, and goals. Branden also debunks the misguided notion that self-esteem is a &#34;feel-good phenomenon&#34; and shows instead how self-esteem, rationality, perseverance, self-responsibility, and personal integrity are all intimately related.</p><p>In the more than thirty years since Nathaniel Branden first published The Psychology of Self-Esteem, psychologists, counselors, educators, and the general public worldwide have come to appreciate the extraordinary power of the ideas expressed in his classic work.

It is shameful to relate such a disgusting scandal to sacred ears! But if the doctor fears the virus of the plague, who will apply the cauterization? If he is nauseated by those whom he is to cure, who will lead sick souls back to the state of health?&#x201d; With these words, St. Peter Damian introduces the Book of Gomorrah, undoubtedly the most stirringly eloquent and impassioned denunciation of sexual perversion ever penned by a Catholic saint. Although it was written almost a thousand years ago, the Book of Gomorrah in many ways seems addressed to our own times, associating the phenomena of clerical homosexual behavior and pederasty, and endorsing the imprisonment of clergy who are a danger to youth. The Book of Gomorrah offers a scathing analysis of the evil of sodomy, while also expressing compassion for those who have fallen into such vice and the possibility of their redemption by the aid of divine grace. It explains the devastating effects of the vice both spiritually and psychologically, and warns that such behavior, particularly among the clergy, will bring down the wrath of God. It also urges the permanent defrocking of clerics who are habituated to homosexual behavior and endorses the permanent confinement those guilty of child sex abuse. This new translation by Matthew Cullinan Hoffman is the most accurate and faithful available in English, and carries a foreword by Cardinal Juan Sandoval ï¿½ï¿½iguez, Archbishop Emeritus of Guadalajara. It also includes a 10,000-word biographical introduction recounting Damian&#x2019;s struggle against corruption in the Catholic Church, and a translator&#x2019;s preface that breaks new scholarly ground and resolves old controversies about the text.</p><p>Matthew Cullinan Hoffman's award-winning articles have appeared hundreds of times in dozens of major newspapers, magazines, and news services, including the <i>Wall Street Journal, London Sunday Times, Detroit News, LifeSite News, Catholic World Report,</i> and the <i>National Catholic Register.</i> He has been a Latin America correspondent with <i>LifeSite News</i> since 2007, and oversaw the creation and initial direction of <i>Notifam,</i> LSN's Spanish and Portuguese language service. He is currently a graduate student at Holy Apostles College and Seminary, where he is certified for proficiency in Latin, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian."Hoffman has produced a highly readable translation of St Peter Damian's most famous work ... As the Church once again confronts the consequences of a collapse of clerical sexual discipline, we do well to read St. Peter's insistence on taking seriously the Church's early penitential tradition, and the Scriptural references which formed the foundation for this, as well as his zeal for the souls of both sinners and the victims of abuse. Hoffman has done a great service to his readers in preparing this edition." &nbsp;--<b>Dr. Joseph Shaw</b>, Tutorial Fellow in Philosophy at St. Benet's Hall, Oxford<br><br>"The <i>Book of Gomorrah</i> has recently been translated from the original Latin into English, with copious introductory material, by an erudite Catholic who is faithful to Christ and his Church: Matthew Cullinan Hoffman. I have accepted with pleasure the task of writing this brief presentation of a book which ... brings us to the realization that a thousand years ago sexual vices were being practiced by various sons of the Church that lamentably are present today and have been the occasion of scandal, discredit, and apostasy." --From the foreword by <b>Cardinal Juan Sandoval ï¿½ï¿½iguez</b><br><br>"With this translation, Matthew Hoffman gives a tremendous gift to the Church, at a time when she desperately needs to hear the undiluted truth, spoken with love, even at the risk of offending." --<b>Fr. Shenan Boquet</b>, President of Human Life International<br><br>"Peter Damian's <i>Liber Gomorrhianus </i>(<i>Book of Gomorrah</i>) tackles sexual immorality among Christians, especially clergy and religious, with shocking frankness. Yet his unwavering condemnation of sexual impurity appears alongside laments over the souls of those who have fallen into impurity and exhortations that they rise again. Scholars of ecclesiastical history ... will appreciate this readily accessible and faithful translation of the <i>Liber Gomorrhianus</i>." --<b>Dr. Daniel Van Slyke</b>, S.T.L., Ph.D., Associate Professor of Theology at Holy Apostles College<br><br>"At a time when there is a tragic effort in our societies on both sides of the ocean, to consider normal what it is against nature, Matthew Hoffman has to be strongly congratulated for making accessible the<i> Liber Gomorrhianus</i>&nbsp;of St. Peter Damian, an important Doctor of the Church ...

In 1990, Schooler met Japanese photographer Michio Hoshino, and began a profound friendship cemented by a shared love of adventure and a passionate quest to find the elusive glacier bear, an exceedingly rare creature, seldom seen and shrouded in legend. But only after Hoshino's tragic death from a bear attack does Schooler succeed in photographing the animal -- completing a remarkable journey that ultimately brings new meaning to his life.</p><p><em>The Blue Bear</em> is an unforgettable book. Set amid the wild archipelagoes, deep glittering fjords, and dense primordial forests of Alaska's Glacier Coast, it is rich with the lyric sensibility and stunning prose of such nature classics as Barry Lopez's <em>Arctic Dreams</em> and Peter Matthiessen's <em>The Snow Leopard.</em></p></p><p>"People step into the [Alaskan] landscape and vanish without a trace," writes wildlife guide Lynn Schooler in this ode to the wild beauty of the Alaskan coast, an unusual friendship, and a mysterious bear with fur the color of "burnished metal." Schooler spent a decade searching for the elusive blue (or glacier) bear with Michio Hoshino, Japan's preeminent wildlife photographer. Hoshino was a gentle genius who would sit still for hours, his face swelling from mosquito bites, for the perfect photograph, and who had the same patience and consideration for a bruised heart like Schooler's. Schooler had lost all ability to trust, scarred first by the scorn of classmates for his twisted body and finally by the brutal murder of the woman he loved. But as a guide--both for wildlife photographers and for readers of this evocative and gracefully composed memoir--Schooler richly reveals the place that sustains him. He makes remarkable connections between whales and the complex workings of old-growth forests, between glaciers dropping 100-foot columns of ice into waiting fjords, and the breathing of the planet. Ultimately, though, it is Hoshino's death by a bear that finally enables Schooler to make peace with humanity and death. A quiet, profound gem. <i>--Lesley Reed</i><p>Lynn Schooler, author of <em>The Blue Bear</em>, has lived in Alaska for more than thirty years.

You have 100 billion brain cells, each connected by ganglia and neurons to as many as twenty thousand other cells. The total number of thoughts that you can think is therefore equal to one hundred billion to the twenty thousandth power.<br> According to brain expert Tony Buzan, this means that the number of ideas you can generate is equal to the number one followed by eight pages of zeroes, more potential ideas than the number of all the molecules in the known universe.<br>The question is, "How are you using this powerful mental supercomputer?"<br> You have the mental ability right now to set any goal and achieve everything you could ever want or hope for in life. By using your brain&#x2014;your ability to think, plan, and create&#x2014;with greater precision and accuracy, you can solve any problem, overcome every obstacle, and achieve any goal you can set for yourself.<br> Your mental supercomputer is so powerful that you could not use your full potential if you had a hundred lifetimes.<br><br><b>10 Percent of Potential<br></b><br> When I was twenty-one, I was impressed when I heard that the average person uses only 10 percent of his or her mental ability. I later learned that the true number is closer to 2 percent. Most people have enormous reserves of mental capacity that they fail to use, that they are apparently saving up for some good reason.<br> Imagine that you had inherited a bank account containing $1 million and growing regularly with interest. But you only ever accessed twenty thousand dollars of this amount because you lacked the necessary code to acquire the rest of your money. The remainder of this wealth was yours, but you couldn't get at it, because you did not know the correct account number that would release these funds to you.<br> This ist he situation of most people. They have enormous stores of mental ability that they habitually fail to use.<br> In the pages ahead, you will learn a series of simple, practical, proven ways to tap into more and more of your natural thinking talents and abilities.

Lacking one key number, you could spin the dial forever and never get into the riches contained inside your mental vault.<br> But with one extra number, in the correct order, the vaulut would open, and you could achieve extraordinary things with your life.<br> This book contains some of the best combinations ever discovered in terms of thinking tools that enable you to make quantum leaps in your life. In many cases, what holds you back is simply a matter of perspective, your particular way of looking at things.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Your Explanatory Style<br><br></b> Dr. Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania calls the way you explain or interpret things to yourself your "explanatory style."<br> This can be as simple as the difference between optimism and pessimism, the glass seen as half-full or as half-empty. The optimist looks for the good and what can be gained from every situation, while the pessimist looks for the problem or downside in each situation.<br> But as Josh Billings, the western humorist, once said, "it ain't what a man knows what hurts him; it's what he knows that ain't true."<br> Ignorance is nto bliss. The failure to use the appropriate thinking tools and styles in a particular area or situation can be disastrous&#x2014;and often leads to overwhelming failure.<br><br><b>Look for the Good</b><br><br> Very often, when you change your perspective, you see things differently, make different decisions, and get different results. Napoleon Hill says in his succes classic <i>Think and Grow Rich</i>&nbsp;that "within every problem or difficulty there lies the seed of an equal or greater benefit or advantage."<br> After interviewing more than five hundred of the wealthiest self-made multimillionaires in America, he found they all had certain qualities in common. One of these common denominators was that the wealthy people in his research had developed the habit of always seeking the valuable lesson in every setback or diffuclty. And they always found it.<br> Most of their fortunes had come about as the result of applying the lessons they had learned through failure and hardship to developing breakthrough products and services that eventually made themr ich. But without the temporary failures and the lessons they contained, they would still be working for wages.<br> Here is a simple way to transform your thinking to that of the most positive and successful people in our society. Think about the biggest problem that you have in your life today. Now imagine that this problem has been sent to you as a gift, to teach you something. Ask yourself, "What is the lesson or lessons that I can learn from this situation that can help me to be happier and more successful in the future?"<br> Perhaps your biggest problem today is not a problem at all. Perhaps it is an opportunity. As Henry Ford said, "Failure is merely an opportunity to more intelligently begin again."&nbsp;<br><br><b>The Great Discovery</b><br><br> Perhaps the greatest discovery in human history is that "you become what you think about&#x2014;most of the time." Your beliefs, either positive or negative, helpful or hurtful, largely determine everything you do and how you do it.<br> What do you think about most of the time? And how do you think about it?<br> As Wayne Dyer wrote, "You don't believe what you see; you see what you already believe."<br> Jim Rohn said, "Everything you have in your life, you have attracted to yourself by the person you are. You can change your life because you can change your thinking; you can change the person you are."<br> My bestselling book is titled <i>Change your Thinking, Change Your Life</i>. And its title's message is true.<br> As you learn and apply these different ways of thinking, you will begin to change the person you are inside.<br> By the Law of Correspondence, which says, "As within, so without," your outer life will begin to correspond to and mirror or reflect your inner life. As your inner life changes, your outer life changes to reflect this new thinking. Shakespeare wrote, "There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."<br> Let's begin to learn about and think the ways that the most successful and happy people think so that you can get the results and enjoy the rewards that the most successful people enjoy.&nbsp;</p><h2>Trust in Me: A Novel (A Wait for You Novella, 1)</h2><p><p><em>It's Wait for You</em> as you've never seen it. <em>Trust in Me</em> lets you in on Cam's side of the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling story.</p> <p>Cameron Hamilton is used to getting what he wants, especially when it comes to women.

Within his solitude he reflected on and identified with the parable&#x2019;s characters and experienced profound and inspiring life lessons.<br><br>This captivating book was created from never-before-published materials that formed the basis of the small workshop inspired by Nouwen&#x2019;s intimate encounter with Rembrandt&#x2019;s painting. Readers are led to welcome their unique Belovedness through practices of &#x201c;spiritual listening,&#x201d; journaling, and communing with God, thus connecting personally with the unique, unconditional love of the One who created them. <i>Home Tonight</i> is a practical guide for the inner journey home.</p><p>To learn more about the life and work of Henri J.M.&nbsp;Nouwen, please visit HenriNouwen.org .Inspired by Rembrandt's famous painting "The Return of the Prodigal Son, Henri Nouwen embarked on a long spiritual journey in search of the place within where God has chosen to dwell. He shared his deeply personal meditations in "The Return of the Prodigal Son, a spiritual classic that interweaves elements of art history, memoir, midrash, and self-help. It has sold more than 300,000 copies and its popularity continues to rise ten years after its original publication. <br>RETURNING: REFLECTIONS ON THE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL SON grew out of a series of lectures Nouwen presented as he immersed himself further in the desire to understand and embrace the meaning of the father's challenge to love his son and the son's challenge to receive that love. In thoughtful, incisive analyses of each character, Nouwen brings the parable to life and brilliantly illuminates the nature of what it means to love and to be loved. <br>Elegantly packaged and affordably priced, RETURNING: REFLECTIONS ON THE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL SON is the perfect holiday gift for readers familiar with Nouwen's writings (more than two million copies of his books are currently in print), as well as those discovering his ageless wisdom for the first time.</p><h2>Everything Is Cinema: The Working Life of Jean-Luc Godard</h2><p><p><b>A "serious-minded and meticulously detailed . . . account of the lifelong artistic journey" of one of the most influential filmmakers of our age (<i>The New York Times</i>)</b> </p><p>When Jean-Luc Godard wed the ideals of filmmaking to the realities of autobiography and current events, he changed the nature of cinema. Unlike any earlier films, Godard's work shifts fluidly from fiction to documentary, from criticism to art. The man himself also projects shifting images&#x2015;cultural hero, fierce loner, shrewd businessman. Hailed by filmmakers as a&#x2015;if not the&#x2015;key influence on cinema, Godard has entered the modern canon, a figure as mysterious as he is indispensable. </p><p>In <i>Everything Is Cinema</i>, critic Richard Brody has amassed hundreds of interviews to demystify the elusive director and his work. Paying as much attention to Godard's technical inventions as to the political forces of the postwar world, Brody traces an arc from the director's early critical writing, through his popular success with Breathless, to the grand vision of his later years. He vividly depicts Godard's wealthy conservative family, his fluid politics, and his tumultuous dealings with women and fellow New Wave filmmakers. </p><p><i>Everything Is Cinema</i> confirms Godard's greatness and shows decisively that his films have left their mark on screens everywhere.</p></p><p><p><b>Richard Brody</b> is a film critic and editor at <i>The New Yorker</i>. <i>Everything Is Cinema</i> is his first book.</p>Chapter One<br>"WE DO NOT THINK, WE ARE THOUGHT" <p></p>IN THE SECOND EDITION, DATED JUNE 1950, of A THIN newspaper-like magazine published in Paris, La Gazette du cinï¿½ma, a nineteen-year-old writer made a modest debut. Jean-Luc Godard&#x2019;s article, simply titled "Joseph Mankiewicz," was a short and breezy overview of that director&#x2019;s career, though, as in the following reference to the director&#x2019;s recent film, A Letter to Three Wives, it was devoted less to his films than to Mankiewicz himself: " &#x2018;One can judge a woman&#x2019;s past by her present,&#x2019; Mankiewicz says somewhere: this letter to three married women is also three letters to the same woman, one whom the director probably loved." <p></p>In an eight-paragraph jaunt, the young writer lightly sketched a conception of the cinema that was as intensely personal as it was revolutionary: he suggested that films are one with the world offscreen. Casually, and without any theoretical fuss, he treated films as something more than creations that bore the mark of their makers; he considered them inseparable from the lives of their creators. <p></p>Godard&#x2019;s piece on the front page of the next issue of La Gazette, "For a Political Cinema," is as provocative now as it seemed at the time. In it, he put forth an aesthetic framework that daringly overrode basic ideological distinctions in the name of specifically cinematic values. <p></p>One afternoon, at the end of the Gaumont newsreel, we opened our eyes wide with pleasure: young German Communists were marching in a May Day celebration. Suddenly, space was only the lines of lips and bodies, time only the raising of fists in the air...By the sole force of propaganda that was animating them, these young people were beautiful.1 <p></p>Godard compared these young people to St. Sebastian and to the youths in classical Greek sculpture: the state of possession, albeit an intellectual one, that resulted from the thrall of ideology seemed to him to resemble religious devotion and thus to confer on its subject a transcendent serenity. He added that in Soviet films, "the actor infallibly returns to what he originally was, a priest. The Fall of Berlin and The Battle of Stalingrad are coronation masses." Godard treated expressions of Communist and Christian faith as equivalent, and admired the similar power of Nazi propaganda films, which had so recently been pressed upon Parisian moviegoers by German occupiers: <p></p>We could not forget Hitler Youth Quex, certain passages of films by Leni Riefenstahl, several shocking newsreels from the Occupation, the maleficent ugliness of The Eternal Jew. It is not the first time that art is born of constraint. <p></p>Godard praised these films not for their political message but for their psychology: they depicted people under the influence, and it hardly mattered whether that influence was political or religious. He took all fanaticisms to be alike and to be equally beautiful. Without equating the far left and the far right politically, Godard equated them aesthetically. <p></p>The essay ends with an exhortation: "French filmmakers in search of scripts, how have you unfortunate souls not yet filmed the assessment of taxes, the death of Philippe Henriod [sic], the wonderful life of Danielle Casanova?" Henriot, the Minister of Information in the Vichy government and a frequent and familiar orator on French radio under occupation, was killed in 1944 by Resistance fighters. Casanova, the founder of a Communist youth newspaper in the 1930s, was a Resistance fighter who died at Auschwitz. Godard endorsed as equally cinematically fertile the actions of a collaborator, of a resister, and ordinary parliamentary infighters, and he took the adventures and anecdotes that arose in the course of contemporary and recent history to be the cinema&#x2019;s natural subject. The passions to which the characters in such films would bear witness were those that belonged to the real world, as verified by the reality from which they derived. The cinematic fictions that the young Godard dreamed of arose from the documentary impulse. <p></p>Moreover, his idealistic depiction of the young fanatic was a touching, if oblique, self-portrait. He was leading a life of singular and exalted purpose: his monomaniacal fervor was ignited by movies, and he gave remarkably definitive expression to it in the following issue of La Gazette. <p></p>The October 1950 edition featured a brief note by "H.L."&#x2014;Hans Lucas, "Jean-Luc" in German, a pseudonym that Godard occasionally adopted through 1955&#x2014;on a documentary film about Alexander Calder&#x2019;s mobiles. One mercurial sentence sums up with a self-revealing clarity the adolescent Godard&#x2019;s relation to the cinema: "At the cinema, we do not think, we are thought."2 This observation was less an avowal of passivity than of the will to self-transformation through movies. It indicates Godard&#x2019;s consuming submission to cinema and the extent to which he experienced it as a personal epiphany, indeed a transfiguration. Godard had reached the essence of the experience at once, and conveyed it in an unabashed confession. In a single aphorism, he broke down the barriers of aesthetic distance and contemplation that separate the cinema, its viewers, and its makers. At the earliest stage of his work, Godard&#x2019;s existence and that of the cinema were already fused. <p></p>These three articles delineate a coherent and comprehensive cinematic philosophy, one which Godard would realize and rework in a wide variety of forms in a filmmaking career that began in 1954 and continues to this day. The ideas that they sketch are the unity of the filmmaker with the film, the inseparability of both from the social world at large, the credence of a devout moviegoer in the reality of the world as presented in the cinema, and the aesthetic fecundity of this fanatical submission. The viewer who was "thought" at the cinema was Godard himself; the filmmaker who was one with his film would be Godard himself; and his films would be the seemingly infinite variations on the theme of his singular faith in the cinema and in its ability to preserve and to reflect both the reality of the filmmaker and of his times through the intersection of personal stories and political history. <p></p>But each of these principles came with a price tag. Godard&#x2019;s submission to the cinema risked alienation from life. Films conceived as the expression of fanatical devotion to the cinema risked becoming a closed circuit of self-satisfied self-reference to the exclusion of reality. The identification of the film and the filmmaker risked the creation of a cult of personality that would detract attention from the filmmaker&#x2019;s work. And the avidly omnivorous, ideologically indeterminate recording of political currents ran the risk of detachment and ambiguity. Over time, Godard would recognize all of these risks and, in his work and his life, would attempt to confront and to overcome them. <p></p>THE STORY OF Jean-Luc Godard&#x2019;s work is one of a conversion to the secular religion of art and, specifically, to the art of cinema. For this art form, for this sort of passion, the holy city was, and remains, Paris. <p></p>The movies started in France, with the work of the Lumiï¿½re brothers,3 and the special relationship of Paris to the movies is in large part due to that city&#x2019;s central role in French civilization. For France, Paris is three things in one: it is the country&#x2019;s New York, Washington, D.C., and Hollywood&#x2014;the cultural, political, and cinematic capital. The three domains are much more strongly interconnected in France than in the United States, and activity in any one of the three fields is quickly reflected in the other two. As a result, in France the movie business has also been, all along, both a strain of high art and a sensitive political barometer. <p></p>French filmmakers participated in, and often emerged from, literary circles, and Parisian artists took a serious interest in the movies almost from their inception. It was the French critic Ricciotto Canudo who called the cinema the "sixth art" in a 1911 essay (and the "seventh art" in 1919). Charlie Chaplin and D. W. Griffith were French cultural heroes as early as 1916, and artists of all sorts, especially the surrealists, took the cinema very seriously. Jean Cocteau made a film in 1930; Salvador Dali collaborated with Luis Buï¿½uel on Un Chien andalou and L&#x2019;Age d&#x2019;or; the film director Sacha Guitry was first a famous playwright; the greatest French prewar filmmaker, Jean Renoir, who made his first film in 1925, was the son of Auguste Renoir, the artist. Unlike American writers, for whom working on movies usually meant going to Hollywood and setting literature aside, such French writers as Cocteau, Jean-Paul Sartre, Andrï¿½ Malraux, Jean Giraudoux, and Jacques Prï¿½vert were active in the cinema without having to distance themselves, geographically or practically, from the literary scene. <p></p>Postwar Paris was teeming with movies, especially American movies. Having been deprived of Hollywood productions under the German occupation, moviegoers were hungry to see those that had been made during World War II as well as the latest ones, and they flooded the screens. These films too were taken seriously, and nowhere more so than in a magazine called La Revue du cinï¿½ma, which was published by France&#x2019;s most prestigious literary publisher, Gallimard. When the fifteen-year-old Jean-Luc Godard came to Paris in 1946 to attend the prestigious Lycï¿½e Buffon, he entered a lively and burgeoning cinematic scene, one that was energized both by the quantity of films available and by the quality of thought in circulation regarding the "seventh art." It was enriched by contact with the literary, artistic, and intellectual elite that embraced it, and was riven by political controversies that mirrored the political divisions of postwar France&#x2014;some of which were aroused by the cinema itself. <p></p>GODARD WAS BORN ON DECEMBER 3, 1930, in the elegant seventh arrondissement of Paris. His father, Paul Godard, a doctor, moved the family to Switzerland four years later. His mother, Odile, nï¿½e Monod, was the daughter of one of the most prominent bankers in France, Julien Monod, a founder of the Banque Paribas. Monod was also an extremely literate man, a close friend of the writer Paul Valï¿½ry and, after Valï¿½ry&#x2019;s death in 1945, his literary executor. <p></p>Family documents include a letter that Valï¿½ry wrote to Odile Monod in April 1928, on the occasion of her engagement to Paul Godard. She was eighteen years old at the time; her fiancï¿½ was twenty-seven. Her parents opposed the marriage; Paul Godard, though Protestant like the Monods, was not of their social station. Nonetheless, the couple married in 1928. They settled temporarily in Paris, and their first child, Rachel, was born on January 1, 1930. (Valï¿½ry&#x2019;s letter to the newborn, dated January 6, 1930, is published in the collection Lettres ï¿½ quelques-uns.) Godard also has two younger siblings, a brother, Claude, born in 1933, and a sister, Vï¿½ronique, born in 1937. <p></p>The most comprehensive research on the subject of Godard&#x2019;s family and youth has been done by Colin MacCabe, who was, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Godard&#x2019;s authorized biographer; the results of his research were published in 2003, in his Portrait of the Artist at Seventy.4 Paul Godard worked at a private medical clinic, La Ligniï¿½re, near Gland, on the shore of Lake Geneva, between Geneva and Lausanne, and ultimately opened a clinic of his own, near Lausanne. Broken plaster in a wall there was said in family lore to have been made by young Jean-Luc&#x2019;s head during a transport of rage. To see a photograph of the wall is to fear for any child whose head might have done it.5 His mother wrote of the toddler Godard&#x2019;s furious temper, calling him a grand ï¿½clabousseur (a great spatterer).6 <p></p>The family was prosperous and cultured. Reading aloud from literature was a common form of domestic entertainment and ritual. Godard&#x2019;s grandfather, Julien Monod, enforced humanistic rules, including the requirement that youngsters recite literature at the dinner table. Each year, on his maternal grandparents&#x2019; wedding anniversary, young Jean-Luc was expected to recite Valï¿½ry&#x2019;s poem "Le Cimetiï¿½re marin" (The Seaside Cemetery).7 (Moreover, Godard recalled receiving Latin lessons from Valï¿½ry.) 8 Religion was part of the family&#x2019;s cultural heritage as well, and Godard recalled attending Protestant "temple" regularly though without doctrinaire devotion: he considered it a casual habit ("I went, the same way I played soccer or did gymnastics") 9 and, with his grandfather Monod, debated the minister&#x2019;s sermons. <p></p>When World War II started, nine-year-old Jean-Luc Godard was in Brittany on vacation with relatives, and it was only with some difficulty that he could return to Switzerland. Godard spent most of the war in Switzerland, though he and members of his family habitually crossed Lake Geneva in a small boat to make clandestine visits to their grandfather&#x2019;s estate on the French side of the lake. <p></p>During the war, Godard&#x2019;s parents worked with the Red Cross and, Godard came to believe, had knowledge of the concentration camps established by Nazi Germany. MacCabe emphasizes the pro-English sympathies of Paul Godard (who had studied in London and, during the war, sheltered an English prisoner of war), yet Godard often spoke instead of his father&#x2019;s pro-German sympathies, and, following his family&#x2019;s lead, he was rooting for the Germans. He followed the course of the war on a map, with pins representing the movement of the opposing armies as reported in newspapers; he cheered on the advances of the German army and lamented its reversals, and later recalled, "When Rommel lost at El Alamein, I was deeply affected, a little as if my favorite soccer team had lost a game." <p></p>Godard&#x2019;s maternal grandparents were supporters of Vichy. Godard later described his maternal grandfather as "anti-Jew" and an "anti-Semite," and remembered hearing Julien Monod refer to his doctor as a youpin (kike).10 At home, the family listened to Vichy-run radio, where Jean-Luc grew accustomed to the rhetoric of pro-German politicians and commentators and remembered, decades later, the rapt attention when speeches by Philippe Henriot were broadcast. The days of Henriot&#x2019;s assassination (in 1944) and of the execution of Robert Brasillach, the right-wing critic and novelist and anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi propagandist (in 1945), were days of mourning in the Godard house.11 <p></p>Godard recalled spending about a year and a half, from the ages of twelve and thirteen, in wartime Vichy, where his maternal grandfather "knew some people." Godard recalled that he always had an "affinity" for Julien Monod, whose sympathies were clearly suggested by the reading that he shared with his grandson Jean-Luc, as Godard later recalled: "I read Les Dï¿½combres, by Lucien Rebatet, because my grandfather was ultra-literary ...At night, we read aloud. We read Rebatet&#x2019;s novel."12 Rebatet, who was convicted of collaboration in 1946 and spent six years in prison, was a vehement anti-Semite and actively endorsed France&#x2019;s pro-Nazi regime. Les Dï¿½combres (The Ruins), his lengthy screed about the decline of France&#x2014;in his view, due largely to French Jewry and reversible by collaboration with Germany&#x2014;was said to be "for the little Parisian collaborationist world, the great politico-literary event of 1942." 13 <p></p>The young Godard was an eager reader; his preferred fare was the children&#x2019;s adventure novel, such as Le Voyage d&#x2019;Edgar, by Edouard Peisson, whose work was popular at the time. His mother was ...</p><h2>Growing an Engaged Church: How to Stop &#34;Doing Church&#34; and Start Being the Church Again</h2><p>Growing an Engaged Church offers unique, research-based, often counterintuitive solutions to the challenges facing churches today, including declining congregant participation, decreasing contributions, and slumping membership.

The FBI later described his trove of documents as the most complete and extensive intelligence ever achieved from any source.&#x201d; Renowned historian Christopher Andrew had exclusive access to both Mitrokhin and his archive. In 1999, they published the explosive bestseller <i>The Sword and the Shield</i>, which provided a complete account of KGB operations in Europe and America. In <i>The World Was Going Our Way</i>, Andrew now chronicles the KGB's extensive penetration of governments throughout the Third World-the battlefield on which the U.S.S.R. sought to achieve global supremacy. Andrew's definitive account fundamentally revises the history of the Cold War, and sheds new light on the state of the world today. The KGB worked tirelessly for decades to foster anti-Americanism in the developing world, making this book essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the intractable hostility America faces in the ongoing war on terror.</p><p><b>Christopher Andrew</b> is Professor of Modern and Contemporary History at Cambridge University. In addition to <i>The Sword and the Shield</i>, his previous books include <i>Her Majesty's Secret Service</i>, <i>KGB</i>, and <i>For the President's Eyes Only</i>. He lives in Cambridge, England.Yes, Virginia, there really was a KGB, nasty and brutish and also pretty dumb much of the time. So we are reminded by this second volume produced by Christopher Andrew, a Cambridge University historian, from a juicy cache of KGB documents copied and spirited out of Russia by Vasili Mitrokhin. He was a bureaucrat in the old Soviet intelligence agency who got the last laugh on his old bosses by stealing many of their best secrets. The first volume, The Sword and the Shield, used the Mitrokhin documents to show the extent of Soviet espionage in the Western world during the Cold War. It was chock-full of new information that tended to confirm the darkest Western worries about what Soviet spies were up to in the four decades after World War II. It sold tens of thousands of copies in Europe and America.<p>The publishers of this book are hoping for a similar commercial success and are doing their best to hype their product. "Newly Revealed Secrets," the dust jacket promises. But while the information divulged here can be fascinating, it is far from earthshaking. The book may cause a stir in India by demonstrating just how thoroughly news organizations and politics were penetrated by the KGB in the Indira Gandhi era, but there are no startling surprises or sensations disclosed here.</p><p>And frustratingly, the book adopts a KGB-centric view of Soviet foreign policy that implies that the cold warriors in Moscow had a triumphant sense that, as the title says, the world was going their way. Andrew, a serious scholar who provides extremely useful context for many of the anecdotes he recounts, falls short on the larger issue: the broad context in which the KGB and the CIA played their Cold War games in the Third World. Only at the end of his book does he acknowledge how badly things were going for the Soviets in the most important sense: Their entire system was failing, a process that began long before Mikhail Gorbachev came to power and initiated the changes that, in just six years, unraveled the Soviet empire.</p><p>In the years after 1960 that are the subject of this book, the world was never really going Moscow's way, despite anxieties to the contrary in many Western countries. Soviet political leaders never behaved as though they expected the United States and its allies to lose their contest with the Soviet Union. By the early 1970s, when I spent three years in the Soviet Union as The Post's Moscow correspondent, Soviet communism was still a system but no longer a living ideology. At all levels of society, cynicism had trumped revolutionary zeal.</p><p>The Mitrokhin documents show that the KGB was more susceptible to Marxist-Leninist delusions than the Politburo, which isn't surprising. The KGB was a police organization. It was a thoroughly Soviet institution, just as J. Edgar Hoover's FBI was a thoroughly American one. Also like Hoover's FBI, it was a little weird and not typical of its society's political class. Cops are a special breed; they tend to see the world darkly and aren't very good at grays. The KGB officers depicted in this book are familiar to anyone who dealt with our G-Men in the Hoover era -- and, often, laughably incompetent.</p><p>Reading about the KGB's efforts to influence events in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia, one is struck again and again by how hapless they were. Foreign leaders repeatedly took Soviet arms and money but refused to toe Moscow's line or do anything truly helpful for the Soviet Union. Cuba's Fidel Castro and Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser might have been the very best at this, but there were many more.</p><p>For instance, Andrew and Mitrokhin reveal that the Costa Rican social democrat Josï¿½ Figueres Ferrer took $300,000 in KGB money to help finance his political activities while remaining a staunch anticommunist. His only tangible concession was to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union after he became president in 1953; he also agreed to occasional meetings with KGB agents. The "big men" in Angola, Ethiopia and elsewhere who called themselves Marxist-Leninists were well-armed and well-funded by the Soviets, but they were all failures in power who only debased the Marxist-Leninist currency on their continent.</p><p>The Mitrokhin documents confirm that the Soviets eagerly helped Nicaragua's Sandinistas and the left-leaning Salvador Allende in Chile, but they also show a total absence of optimism about either. The KGB realized that Allende was doomed long before the military coup that ousted him in 1973, and the Sandinistas' brief victory in Nicaragua came as a surprise. In the case of Allende, the documents show, Yuri Andropov, the longtime leader of the KGB, actually hid his agency's pessimistic prognosis from his comrades in the Soviet political leadership.</p><p>Andrew identifies the mid-1970s as a time when the Soviets seemed most hopeful about their prospects in the Third World. In fact, this was the moment when a doddering Politburo deluded itself into playing serious games in far-flung corners of the globe. This followed the American defeat in Vietnam, Richard M. Nixon's willingness to treat Leonid Brezhnev as an equal and a period of economic difficulties in the West -- all read in Moscow as signs of American decline. Using Cubans as their surrogates, the Soviets intervened in peripheral nations of southern Africa and, in 1979, launched the disastrous invasion of Afghanistan. In 1983, Andropov, for years the keeper of the KGB flame, became the Soviet leader, but he died after just 15 months in power; his successor, Konstantin Chernenko, died 13 months later. Then came Gorbachev (in 1985); and then the end.</p><p>After recounting many intriguing details about the secret struggle for influence in the Third World, Andrew devotes much of the conclusion of his book to reaffirming the obvious: The KGB was an ugly institution that tried to hurt American interests wherever it could. But did this need further proving? To my mind, it would have been more useful to draw larger conclusions from the many examples he provides of the clumsy ineffectiveness of an organization that scared us for too long. </p><p>Ultimately, The World Was Going Our Way confirms a conversation I had in the early 1970s with Raisa Orlova, a literary scholar and dissident. At the time, I asked her to explain how the KGB's pursuit of Soviet dissidents could have been so clumsy. "Why should they be better," she asked, "than the bureaucrats in the Ministry of Agriculture?" In the end, the KGB did no better at fomenting a world revolution than the Ministry of Agriculture did at feeding the Soviet people. </p><p>Reviewed by Robert G.

Each book opens with a letter from their teacher, "Ms. Brandt," outlining some questions the student might want to think about when preparing the assignment: why did you pick this artist; if you could ask him or her three questions what would they be; and did you learn anything that surprised you? Unfortunately, the end results are cluttered pages and possibly confusing content. While each book includes facts about the subject's life (birth date and place, childhood, work, etc.), it also incorporates little bits of information about the child who is writing the report. For example, Kristin, the "author" of Degas, includes her own self-portrait next to the artist's. The material presented on each subject is strictly biographical; there is no discussion of the artists' technique or place in art history. Colorful pages and lettering highlight the many reproductions, photographs, childlike drawings, and snippets of text. The "Getting to Know the World's Great Artists" series (Children's) presents solid factual information along with reproductions. However, for an engaging introduction to an artist by a fictional character, steer readers to Christina Bj?rk's Linnea in Monet's Garden (R &amp; S, 1987) or Neil Waldman's appealing The Starry Night (Boyds Mills, 2001).<br><i>Susan Lissim, Dwight School, New York City </i><br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Indigo Adults: Understanding Who You Are and What You Can Become</h2><p>Are you an Indigo Adult Soul and don't know it?<br><br>A new type of person is coming into incarnation right now, almost a "next step" in human evolution.

What was the extent of the CIA's involvement with Lee Harvey Oswald? Why was Oswald's file tampered with before the assassination of John F. Kennedy? And why did significant documents from that file mysteriously disappear? Oswald and the CIA answers these questions, not with theories, but with information from the primary sources themselves&#x2014;ex-agents, officials, and secret records. To look at the Oswald file is to look at the most sensitive CIA operation of the Cold War. The story is as alarming as it is tragic; the lies and manipulations it reveals led directly to Kennedy's murder. <i>Oswald and the CIA</i> is a gripping journey to the darkest corners of the CIA.</p><p>was a military intelligence officer and a Professor of History at the University of Maryland.

Now what?: Medical insight, personal stories, and humor by a urologist who has been where you are now.</h2><p>Over 200,000 times a year in the U.S. a patient will leave his urologist&#39;s office having been told he has prostate cancer. What the patient thought to be a disease of old men from which they do not die, now becomes a very complicated and frustrating dilemma about which treatment to pursue. &#34;The Decision&#34; offers the reader an insider&#39;s view to the key issues necessary for a well thought-out treatment plan peculiar only to him. Being a urologist who treats prostate cancer and having had the disease as well, uniquely positions the author in offering guidance to the newly diagnosed prostate cancer patient. Dr. McHugh outlines a novel and multifaceted approach, using an eclectic mix of medical insight ,personal stories and humor, to aid the reader in making his &#34;Decision.&#34; The US Review of Books - Carolyn Davis A urologist, McHugh, was inspired to write this informative book after he developed prostate cancer and dealt with treatment options as a patient. Part guidebook, part autobiography, it is intended for men who are facing the often perplexing choices of potential treatments. &#34;Prostate stories&#34; and more of McHugh&#39;s autobiography complete the book. The Decision is recommended for its combination of empirical tools, personal anecdotes, and overall compassion. Clarion ForeWard Five Star out of Five Book Review: McHugh has written an invaluable tool for the man facing the decision of how to treat his prostate cancer. This reviewer too knows of what he speaks, having been diagnosed with prostate cancer nearly six years ago. He had robotic surgery and is living an active, cancer-free life. John Michael Senger April 28, 2011</p><p>Dr. McHugh has been a private practice urologist in Gainesville, Georgia, for over twenty years. He was a R.O.T.C. cadet and received his undergraduate degree in Chemistry at North Georgia College in Dahlonega, Georgia. He went to medical school and did his urologic residency at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta, Georgia. He and his wife Karen have been married twenty-nine years and have three children. His interests include history, his dogs, and anything related to water and fishing. He was diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer in 2007. Witnessing for years the frustration of his patients making &#34;the decision&#34; regarding which therapy to choose and then having to experience it himself, prompted him to define the decision-making journey for others. During the three months it took for him to decide, it became clear that the decision is multifaceted and depends a lot on the patient&#39;s particular situation at the time of diagnosis. Combining his story-telling abilities with his medical insight and experience, Dr. McHugh offers the reader a fresh and novel approach to deciding what to do about his prostate cancer.

More than 100,000 women married GIs and moved to the United States. Through intellectual vigor and personal recollection, Haunting the Korean Diaspora explores the repressed history of emotional and physical violence between the United States and Korea and the unexamined reverberations of sexual relationships between Korean women and American soldiers. Grace M. Cho exposes how Koreans in the United States have been profoundly affected by the forgotten war and uncovers the silences and secrets that still surround it, arguing that trauma memories have been passed unconsciously through a process psychoanalysts call OC transgenerational haunting.OCO Tracing how such secrets have turned into OC ghosts, OCO Cho investigates the mythic figure of the yanggongju, literally the OC Western princess, OCO who provides sexual favors to American military personnel. She reveals how this figure haunts both the intimate realm of memory and public discourse, in which narratives of U.S. benevolence abroad and assimilation of immigrants at home go unchallenged. Memories of U.S. violence, Cho writes, threaten to undo these narrativesOCoand so they have been rendered unspeakable. At once political and deeply personal, ChoOCOs wide-ranging and innovative analysis of U.S. neocolonialism and militarism under contemporary globalization brings forth a new way of understandingOCoand rememberingOCothe impact of the Korean War.</p><p></p><h2>The Overcoming Bulimia Workbook: Your Comprehensive Step-by-Step Guide to Recovery (A New Harbinger Self-Help Workbook)</h2><p><p>Severe dieting often results in periods of reactive binge eating, a phenomenon experienced by one in twenty American women.

Even more timely now for its insights into the aftermath of torture.</p><p>In 1989, Sister Dianna Ortiz, an American-born nun, was abducted from the compound where she worked in Guatemala. Twenty-four hours later, she escaped, but within that brief period, her body had been burned with cigarettes, she'd been raped, beaten and forced to torture a woman who was already near death. As a consequence of her devastation, Ortiz lost every memory she had of her life before the kidnapping, and spent years battling both real and remembered demons in a struggle to heal herself and to spread the word about U.S. complicity in Guatemala's repressive political system and in the torture and murder of thousands of innocent Guatemalans. This is an important book for two reasons: its illustration of the fallout of torture and the special needs of survivors, and Ortiz's well-documented narrative of the U.S. government's refusal to take seriously what happened to her, particularly as she identified one of her torturers as an American. It's unfortunate that Ortiz didn't have a better editor. This is a powerful story and Ortiz (aided by Davis, communications director of the Guatemala Human Rights Commission) is a strong writer, but the avalanche of detail will confuse readers, and material such as the text of speeches and memos could have been included in an appendix. But Ortiz's determination to tell the truth in spite of ongoing threats and her own fear makes this book, despite its flaws, impossible to dismiss. Photos not seen by PW.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.In the 1980s Sister Dianna Ortiz went to Guatemala to help citizens victimized by one of the world's most oppressive regimes. As a result, she nearly became one of the <i>disperdicios</i>, or the disappeared, called that because they literally disappeared into the night to be raped, tortured, and murdered, never to be seen alive again by their families. Sister Dianna was one of the more fortunate victims of this regime in that her ordeal was relatively brief--and she survived. He book focuses on the long-term effects of her ordeal more than the gory details of what she suffered. But it is about more than just the torture of Sister Dianna or the other <i>disperdicios</i>. It also puts their suffering in context by examining what allowed these things to happen. Sister Dianna's story will interest anyone wishing to understand how rape and torture break down the human spirit, and how it is possible to survive such assaults. Students of political science will also find this book intriguing. <i>June Pulliam</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Adrien Lockman is through with the political unrest and bloodshed in his home country of France, so he sets off to the Canadian territory&#39;s mountain frontier, in search of a place where a man can live his own life in peace. The last thing he expects to find is a woman, half-starved and half-frozen in a shack nestled among the towering peaks of the great Rocky Mountains. Mary Standish thought she&#39;d finally found a place where she was accepted, trapping with her husband for the Hudson Bay Company. But when he dies after a gruesome grizzly fight, she determines to carry on their work. After all, life in these remote mountains is better than enduring the scorn and snubs of &#34;civilized&#34; folk. When she&#39;s forced to face a winter harder than any she&#39;s endured yet, her stubbornness may just be the death of her. Until a stranger appears at her ramshackle door. Adrien had planned to explore the mountain country all winter before he settles down to build a farm in the spring, but he can&#39;t leave this woman to die in the elements. Even though she seems desperate for him to go. As Mary regains strength, she&#39;s torn between wanting to save her dignity, and craving the respect of this man who&#39;s slipped past her defenses. As the winter worsens, the truth becomes all too real-the only way they&#39;ll survive is together.</p><p>Misty M. Beller writes romantic mountain stories, set on the 1800s frontier and woven with the truth of God&#39;s love. She was raised on a farm in South Carolina, so her Southern roots run deep. Growing up, her family was close, and they continue to keep that priority today. Her husband and daughters now add another dimension to her life, keeping her both grounded and crazy. God has placed a desire in Misty&#39;s heart to combine her love for Christian fiction and the simpler ranch life, writing historical novels that display God&#39;s abundant love through the twists and turns in the lives of her characters.</p><h2>Better Briefs and Oral Argument: Third Edition Winning on Appeal (NITA)</h2><p><p>When the late Ruggero J. Aldisert wrote Winning on Appeal in 1992, it became an instant classic in law school classrooms and appellate law practices across the country. To celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the book&#x2019;s release, Tessa L. Dysart and Leslie H. Southwick carry on the Aldisert tradition of revealing the "nuts and bolts" of how to prepare an effective brief with the nuanced art of a delivering a persuasive appeal to the court. Their meticulously rendered update is replete with dozens of interviews with leading appeals judges and practitioners&#x2014;treasured guidance from a bona fide who&#x2019;s who of appellate advocacy in America&#x2014;and escorts readers into the &#x201c;wired&#x201d; courtroom of the twenty-first century, where they explore the benefits and challenges of melding technology with appellate advocacy. With a Foreword penned by U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr., Winning on Appeal conveys the perfect blueprint for any lawyer who wants to win on appeal. Reviews "I argued before Judge Aldisert as a young attorney, and I learned from the experience of trying to hold my own in front of the former Marine. I will certainly never forget those occasions. Arguing before Judge Aldisert was the best (and therefore the most demanding) Socratic experience imaginable. Woe to the lawyer who was unprepared or, worse yet, tried to pull something on the court! But to paraphrase that famous Sinatra song, if you could make it arguing in front of Judge Aldisert, you could make it anywhere. I am very pleased that Rugi&#x2019;s teaching will live on after him in this new edition of Winning on Appeal. For new appellate advocates, this volume should be required reading. I wish that it had been available when I argued my first case. For more experienced attorneys, the book contains advanced tips and reminders that may serve as a corrective against the bad habits that are easy to acquire.

All too often, female prostitutes have been the victims of male serial killers&#x2014;Wuornos&#x2019; killings were the inverse of this pattern. After escaping an abusive childhood at the hands of her grandparents, she became a child prostitute, progressing into a disastrous adulthood of prostitution and damaging affairs with both men and women. Her eventual metamorphosis from victim to attacker had brutal consequences&#x2014;a stream of dead men. This is her story, as told to Christopher Berry-Dee, editor of<i> The New Criminologist</i> and director of Britain's Criminology Research Center.</p><p>"I'm a good person inside, but when I get drunk, I just don't know. It's just... when I get drunk, don't mess the fuck with me..." There have been few female serial killers but Aileen "Lee" Wuornos was an incredible example of this rare species of death-row inhabitants. All-too-often female prostitutes have been the victims of male serial killers--the killings of Wuornos were the inverse of this. She was a child prostitute after running away from an abusive childhood in the hands of her grandparents straight into a disastrous adulthood of difficult affairs with both men and women and prostitution. Her metamorphosis from victim to attacker had brutal consequences: a stream of dead men.

Her musings on language and occasional inclusion of Cyrillic script serve the same purpose.

It is something that has been partially experienced and thoroughly documented by many individuals around the world. In this inspiring look at near-death experiences, authors Brent and Wendy Top illustrate how numerous recorded accounts of near-death experiences relate to Latter-day Saint teachings. More than just a collection of interesting near-death stories, this book is rich with scripture as well as commentary from Latter-day prophets, creating a doctrinal lens through which to view the near-death events shared by various people from differing cultural and religious backgrounds. From the amazing characteristics of our spirit bodies to the incredible love and learning that will take place, you ll find encouragement and peace regarding that next step we will all eventually take, which is, in reality, the beginning of a beautiful new phase of life. You will be fascinated with reports from those who have seen the other side of the veil: a being of light who greeted them in the spirit world; a sense of having a perfect, vitalized spirit body; the rapid, graphic review of one s mortal life; meeting with loved ones; communication by thought transference; spirits in radiant white robes; travel at phenomenal speeds; expanded comprehension and memory powers; gorgeous scenery and vegetation;and an all-encompassing, overwhelming light and love. While emphasizing how we must critically examine these accounts, the authors say, We were amazed at the similarities and consistencies between near-death accounts and the doctrines of the restored gospel. God lives and loves each and every one of us, and what is waiting for us is inexpressibly amazing and wonderful.</p><p>Brent L.

So, when he is approached by an affable ex-football star and told that he is just what the government is looking for to take part in a top-secret programme, he doesn&#39;t hesitate for too long. And so one day Si steps out of his twentieth-century, New York apartment and finds himself back in January 1882. There are no cars, no planes, no computers, no television and the word &#39;nuclear&#39; appears in no dictionaries. For Si, it&#39;s very like Eden, somewhere he could find happiness. But has he really been back in time? The portfolio of tintype photographs and sketches that he brings back convince the government. But all Si wants is to return ...</p><p>Born in 1911 the American author Jack Finney wrote numerous SF novels, thrillers and mysteries, several of which were adapted to film. He is best known as the author of THE BODY SNATCHERS, which became the hugely popular and influential film, THE INVASION OF THE BODYSNATCHERS. He was awarded the WORLD FANTASY AWARD for Lifetime Achievement in 1987. A long time resident of Californa he died in 1995.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>Is shirt-sleeves, the way I generally worked, I sat sketching a bar of soap taped to an upper corner of my drawing board. The gold-foil wrapper was carefully peeled back so that you could still read most of the brand name printed on it; I'd spoiled the wrappers of half a dozen bars before getting that effect. This was a new idea, the product to be shown ready for what the accompanying copy called "fragrant, lathery, lovelier <i>you"</i> use, and I had the job of sketching it into half a dozen layouts, the bar of soap at a slightly different angle in each.<br><br>It was just exactly as boring as it sounds, and I stopped to look out the window beside me, down twelve stories at Fifty-fourth Street and the little heads moving along the sidewalk. It was a sunny, sharply clear day in mid-November, and I'd have liked to be out in it, the whole afternoon ahead and nothing to do; nothing I had to do, that is.<br><br>Over at the paste-up table Vince Mandel, our lettering man, thin and dark and probably feeling as caged-up today as I was, stood working with the airbrush, a cotton surgical mask over his mouth. He was spraying a flesh-colored film onto a <i>Life</i> magazine photo of a girl in a bathing suit. The effect, when he finished, would be to remove the suit, leaving the girl apparently naked except for the ribbon she wore slanted from shoulder to waist on which was lettered MISS BUSINESS MACHINES. This kind of stunt was Vince's favorite at-work occupation ever since he'd thought of it, and the retouched picture would be added to a collection of others like it on the art-department bulletin board, at which Maureen, our nineteen-year-old paste-up girl and messenger, refused ever to look or even glance, though often urged.<br><br>Frank Dapp, our art director, a round little package of energy, came trotting toward his partitioned-off office in the northeast comer of the artists' bullpen. As he passed the big metal supply cabinet just inside the room he hammered violently on its open door, yodeling at full bellow. It was an habitual release of unused energy like a locomotive jetting steam, a starting eruption of sound. But neither Vince nor I nor Karl Jonas at the board ahead of mine glanced up. Neither did anyone in the typists' pool outside, I knew, although strangers waiting in the art-department reception room just down the hall had been known to leap to their feet at the sound.<br><br>It was an ordinary day, a Friday, twenty minutes till lunchtime, five hours till quitting time and the weekend, ten months till vacation, thirty-seven years till retirement. Then the phone rang.<br><br>"Man here to see you, Si." It was Vera, at the switchboard. "He has no appointment."<br><br>"That's okay. He's my connection; I need a fix."<br><br>"What you need can't be fixed." She clicked off. I got up, wondering who it was; an artist in an advertising agency doesn't usually have too many visitors. The main reception room was on the floor below, and I took the long route through Accounting and Media, but no new girls had been hired.<br><br>Frank Dapp called the main reception room Off Broadway. It was decorated with a genuine Oriental rug, several display cases of antique silver from the collection of the wife of one of the three partners, and with a society matron whose hair was also antique silver and who relayed visitors' requests to Vera. As I walked toward it my visitor stood looking at one of the framed ads hung on the walls. Something I don't like admitting and which I've learned to disguise is a shyness about meeting people, and now I felt the familiar slight apprehension and momentary confusion as he turned at the sound of my approaching footsteps. He was bald and short, the top of his head reaching only to my eye level, and I'm an inch short of six feet. He looked about thirty-five, I thought, walking toward him, and he was remarkably thick-chested; he'd outweigh me without being fat. He wore an olive-green gabardine suit that didn't go with his pink redhead's complexion. <i>I hope he's not a salesman,</i> I thought; then he smiled as I stepped into the lobby, a real smile, and I liked him instantly and relaxed. <i>No,</i> I told myself, <i>he's not selling anything,</i> and I couldn't have been more wrong about that.<br><br>"Mr. Morley?" I nodded, smiling back at him. "Mr. Simon Morley?" he said, as though there might be several of us Morleys here at the agency and he wanted to be certain.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>He still wasn't satisfied. "Just for fun, do you remember your army serial number?" He took my elbow and began walking me out into the elevator corridor away from the receptionist.<br><br>I rattled it off; it didn't even occur to me to wonder why I was doing this for a stranger, no questions asked.<br><br>"Right!" he said approvingly, and I felt pleased. We were out in the corridor now, no one else around.<br><br>"Are you from the army? If so, I don't want any today."<br><br>He smiled, but didn't answer the question, I noticed. He said, "I'm Ruben Prien," and hesitated momentarily as though I might recognize the name, then continued. "I should have phoned and made an appointment; but I'm in a hurry so I took a chance on dropping in."<br><br>"That's all right, I wasn't doing anything but working. What can I do for you?"<br><br>He grimaced humorously at the difficulty of what he had to say. "I've got to have about an hour of your time. Right now, if you can manage it." He looked embarrassed. "I'm sorry, but...if you could just take me on faith for a little while, I'd appreciate it."<br><br>I was hooked; he had my interest. "All right. It's ten to twelve; would you like to have lunch? I can leave a little early."<br><br>"Fine, but let's not talk indoors. We could pick up some sandwiches and eat in the park. Okay? It's not too cool."<br><br>Nodding, I said, "I'll get my coat and meet you here. You interest me strangely." I stood hesitating, looking closely at this pleasant, tough-looking, bald little man, then said it. "As I think you know. Matter of fact, you've been through this whole routine before, haven't you? Complete with embarrassed look."<br><br>He grinned and made a little finger-snapping motion. "And I thought I really had it down. Well, it's back to the mirror, and more practice. Get your coat; we're losing time."<br><br>We walked north on Fifth Avenue past the incredible buildings of glass and steel, glass and enameled metal, glass and marble, and the older ones of more stone than glass. It's a stunning street and unbelievable; I never get used to it, and I wonder if anyone really does. Is there any other place where an entire cloud bank can be completely reflected in the windows of one wall of only one building, and with room to spare? Today I especial??? enjoyed being out on Fifth, the temperature in the high 50's, a nice late-fall coolness in the air. It was nearly noon, and beautiful girls came dancing out of every office building we passed, and I thought of how regrettable it was that I'd never know or even speak to most of them. The little bald man beside me said, "I'll tell you what I've come to say to you; then I'll listen to questions. Maybe I'll even answer some. But everything I can really tell you I will have said before we reach Fifty-sixth Street. I've done this thirty-odd times now, and never figured out a good way to say it or even sound very sane while trying, so here goes.<br><br>"There's a project. A U.S. government project I guess you'd have to call it. Secret, naturally; as what isn't in government these days? In my opinion, and that of a handful of others, it's more important than all the nuclear, space-exploration, satellite, and rocket programs put together, though a hell of a lot smaller. I tell you right off that I can't even hint what the project is about. And believe me, you'd never guess. I can and do say that nothing human beings have ever before attempted in the entire nutty history of the race even approaches this in absolute fascination. When I first understood what this project is about I didn't sleep for two nights, and I don't mean that in the usual way; I mean I literally did not sleep. And before I could sleep on the third night I had to have a shot in the arm, and I'm supposed to be the plodding unimaginative type. Do I have your attention?"<br><br>"Yes; if I understand you, you've finally discovered something more interesting than sex."<br><br>"You may find out that you're not exaggerating. I think riding to the moon would be almost dull in comparison to what you may just possibly have a chance to do. It is the greatest possible adventure. I would give anything I own or will ever have just to be in your shoes; I'd give years of my life just for a <i>chance</i> at this. And that's it, friend Morley. I can go on talking, and will, but that's really all I have to say. Except this: through no virtue or merit of your own, just plain dumb luck, you are invited to join the project. To commit yourself to it. Absolutely blind. That's some pig in a poke, all right, but oh, my God, what a pig. There's a pretty good delicatessen on Fifty-seventh Street; what kind of sandwiches you want?"<br><br>"Roast pork, what else?"<br><br>We bought our sandwiches and a couple of apples, then walked on toward Central Park a couple of blocks ahead. Prien was waiting for some sort of reply, and we walked in silence for half a block; then I shrugged irritably, wanting to be polite but not knowing how else to answer. "What am I supposed to say?"<br><br>"Whatever you want."<br><br>"All right; why me?"<br><br>"Well, I'm glad you asked, as the politicians say. There is a particular kind of man we need. He has to have a certain set of qualities. A rather special list of qualities, actually, and a long list. Furthermore, he has to have them in a pretty exact kind of balance. We didn't know that at first. We thought most any intelligent eager young fellow would do. Me, for example. Now we know, or think we do, that he has to be physically right, psychologically right, temperamentally right. He has to have a certain special way of looking at things. He's got to have the ability, and it seems to be fairly rare, to see things as they are and at the same time as they might have been. If that makes any sense to you. It probably does, because it may be that what we mean is the eye of an artist. Those are just some of what he must have or be; there are others I won't tell you about now. Trouble is that on one count or another that seems to eliminate most of the population. The only practical way we've found to turn up likely candidates is to plow through the tests the army gave its inductees; you remember them."<br><br>"Vaguely."<br><br>"I don't know how many sets of those tests have been analyzed; that's not my department. Probably millions. They use computers for the early check-throughs, eliminating all those that are comfortably wide of the mark. Which is most of them. After that, real live people take over; we don't want to miss even one candidate. Because we're finding damn few. We've checked I don't know how many millions of service records, including the women's branches. For some reason women seem to produce more candidates than men; we wish we had more we could check. Anyway, one Simon L. Morley with the fine euphonious serial number looks like a candidate. How come you only made PFC?"<br><br>"A lack of talent for idiocies such as close-order drill."<br><br>"I believe the technical term is two left feet. Out of fewer than a hundred possibilities we've found so far, about fifty have already heard what you're hearing now, and turned us down. About fifty more have volunteered, and over forty of them flunked some further tests. Anyway, after one hell of a lot of work, we have five men and two women who just might be qualified. Most or all of them will fail in the actual attempt; we don't have even one we feel very sure of. We'd like to get about twenty-five candidates, if we possibly can. We'd like a hundred, but we don't believe there are that many around; at least we don't know how to find them. But you may be one."<br><br>"Gee whiz."<br><br>At Fifty-ninth Street as we stood waiting for the light, I glanced at Rube's profile and said, "Rube Prien; yeah. You played football. When was it? About ten years ago."<br><br>He turned to grin up at me. "You remembered! You're a good boy; I wish I'd bought you some thick gooey dessert, the kind I can't eat anymore. Only it was fifteen years ago; I'm not really the young handsome youth I know I must seem."<br><br>"Where'd you play again? I can't remember."<br><br>The light clicked green, and we stepped down off the curb. "West Point."<br><br>"I knew it! You're in the army!"<br><br>"Yep."<br><br>I was shaking my head. "Well, I'm sorry, but it'll take more than you. It'll take five husky fighting MPs to drag me back in, kicking and screaming all the way. Whatever you're selling and however fascinating, I don't want any. The lure of sleepless nights in the army just isn't enough, Prien; I've already had all I want."<br><br>On the other side of the street we stepped up onto the sidewalk, crossed it, then turned onto the curve of a dirt-and-gravel path of Central Park and walked along it looking for an empty bench. "What's wrong with the army?" Rube said with fake injured innocence.<br><br>"You said this would take an hour; I'd need a week just for the chapter headings."<br><br>"All right, <i>don't</i> join the army. Join the navy; we'll make you anything you like from bosun's mate to lieutenant senior grade. Or join the De partment of the Interior; you can be a forester with your very own Smokey-the-Bear hat." Prien was enjoying himself. "Sign up with the post office if you want; we'll make you an assistant inspector and give you a badge and the power to arrest for postal fraud. I mean it; pick almost any branch of the government you like except State or the diplomatic corps. And pick any title you fancy at no more than around a twelve-thousand-a-year salary, and so long as it isn't an elective office. Because, Si -- all right to call you Si?" he said with sudden impatience.<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>"And call me Rube, if you care to. Si, it doesn't matter what payroll you're technically on.

Standing beside the vehicle is a woman with blood on her hands and a dead man at her feet.</p><p>She swears she didn&#x2019;t kill Stephen Wentworth. A stranger stepped out in front of their motorcar, and without warning, fired a single shot before vanishing into the night. But there is no trace of him. And the shaken woman insists it all happened so quickly, she never saw the man&#x2019;s face.</p><p>Although he is a witness after the fact, Rutledge persuades the Yard to give him the inquiry, since he&#x2019;s on the scene. But is he seeking justice&#x2014;or fleeing painful memories in London?</p><p>Wentworth was well-liked, yet his bitter family paint a malevolent portrait, calling him a murderer. But who did Wentworth kill? Is his death retribution? Or has his companion lied? Wolf Pit, his village, has a notorious history: in Medieval times, the last wolf in England was killed there. When a second suspicious death occurs, the evidence suggests that a dangerous predator is on the loose, and that death is closer than Rutledge knows.</p></p><p><p>Since the end of the Great War, Inspector Ian Rutledge has fought to keep memories of the trenches at bay. Unable to sleep after his sister&#x2019;s wedding, he takes a short drive. Hours later he&#x2019;s far from London. The war, which he&#x2019;s kept rigorously in check all day, overwhelms him, and he has only a vague impression of the road unwinding before him. He&#x2019;s jolted out of his nightmare when his headlamps suddenly pick out a motorcar stopped in the middle of the road, and he narrowly misses it. Standing next to the vehicle is a woman, with blood on her hands and a dead man at her feet.</p><p>She swears she didn&#x2019;t kill Stephen Wentworth, telling Rutledge that a stranger stepped in front of their motorcar and without warning fired a single shot before vanishing. Rutledge persuades the Yard to give him the inquiry, but even he isn&#x2019;t sure whether he&#x2019;s seeking justice&#x2014;or fleeing the emptiness that awaits him back in London.</p><p>Probing the victim&#x2019;s background, the Inspector uncovers conflicting views of the dead man. Wentworth appears to have been well liked by most people, yet his bitter family calls Wentworth a murderer. But who, exactly, did Wentworth kill? Is his death retribution for that crime? Or has his dinner partner lied?</p><p>When a second suspicious death occurs, the evidence suggests a dangerous predator on the loose, carefully stalking his victims. <em>But where is he?</em></p><p>Charles Todd is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of the Inspector Ian Rutledge mysteries, the Bess Crawford mysteries, and two stand-alone novels.

But the world that she encountered in the field was dramatically different than anything she could have imagined. It was messy, chaotic, and difficult&#x2014;but she was hooked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this honest and irreverent memoir, she introduces readers to the realities of life as an aid worker. We watch as she manages a 24,000-person camp in Darfur, collects evidence for the Charles Taylor trial in Sierra Leone, and contributes to the massive aid effort to clean up a shattered Haiti. But we also see the alcohol-fueled parties and fleeting romances, the burnouts and self-doubt, and the struggle to do good in places that have long endured suffering. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracing her personal journey from wide-eyed and naï¿½ve newcomer to hardened cynic and, ultimately, to hopeful but critical realist, Alexander transports readers to some of the most troubled locations around the world and shows us not only the seemingly impossible challenges, but also the moments of resilience and recovery.</p></p><p><p><b>JESSICA ALEXANDER</b> spent much of the last decade responding to humanitarian crises across the globe. A former Fulbright scholar, she has worked for various NGOs as well as UN agencies. She has a dual masters degree from Columbia and is currently working toward her PhD.</p><p>&#x201c;In <i>Chasing Chaos</i>, Jessica Alexander serves up a sharp critique of the multi-billion dollar humanitarian aid industry, wrapped in a tender coming-of-age story. Her quietly evocative prose recreates the painful, poignant, and sometimes hilarious experience of marching into 'the field' of armed conflict and disaster to relieve suffering, supported by donations from those who expect heroism. With remarkable honesty and empathy, Alexander reveals how absurd and presumptuous it is to imagine we can fix the world and, even more profoundly, why we must continue to try. An important book.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Sheri Fink, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Five Days at Memorial<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;Terrific new memoir...It's <i>Wild </i>in Sudan.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Nicholas Kristof, <i>New York Times</i> columnist<br><br></b>&#x201c;In her new book <i>Chasing Chaos</i>, Jessica Alexander offers a poignant, clear-eyed look at the world of international disaster relief and her own addiction to aid work...<i>Chasing Chaos</i> is a reminder that happiness is an act of delicate and ever-evolving inner compromise.

Rather, Alexander&#x2019;s honesty about her own ignorance on the true severity of the conditions in the places she visits is precisely what makes her remarkable story so accessible. Even now, after a decade working with multiple humanitarian organizations, the author still makes plain how much she has to learn. Alexander is proud of her achievements, and certainly should be, but it is in her detailing of the vast room for improvement in the system that she focuses, with a dry wit and healthy dose of honest self-evaluation, that we are able to connect with her experiences on a more personal level. We are all the more fortunate for it.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Bustle.com</b><br><br>&#x201c;I think that is what Jessica does so well: puts a human face on aid work. And not just her face, but the faces of her international and national colleagues...Jessica reveals the inconsistencies, the ambivalence of aid work as she takes us to Sudan, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, New York, and Haiti. But, she also offers valuable lessons for the next generation.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Brendan Rigby, whydev.org<br></b><br>&#x201c;What Mary Roach does for the alimentary canal in <i>Gulp</i> and Robin Nagle does for garbage collecting in <i>Picking Up</i>, Jessica Alexander does for global catastrophe in <i>Chasing Chaos...</i>An entertaining memoir of life on the front lines of global catastrophe reveals as much about its author as the world of humanitarian aid<i>.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Shelf Awareness<br></b></i><br>&#x201c;A no-holds-barred description of what it is like to travel to world disaster sites and engage in the complex, challenging, nitty-gritty work of making a difference across lines of culture, class, age, gender, and perspective. In telling the story of her decade as a young and passionate humanitarian aid worker, Jessica Alexander also manages to tell us the best and the worst of what this work is like and to speculate on the aid establishment&#x2014;how it has changed, where it works and what its limits are.

While the book is peppered with hilarious anecdotes&#x2014;it is also salted with tears. Honest, genuine, heartfelt tears. This life and this work that aid and development workers embark upon so often oscillates wildly between stomach bursting laughter and shoulder seizing weeping&#x2014;<i>Chasing Chaos</i> captures these oscillations, and the doldrums in between the ends of the spectrum, perfectly.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Casey Kuhlman, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Shooter</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;During&nbsp;ten years of working with the sick, the hungry, and the injured, Jessica Alexander touches and is touched by victims of genocide, earthquakes, tsunamis, and bombs.

Even if you&#x2019;re a seasoned traveler, this entry into the world of humanitarian aid organizations&#x2014;the good, the bad, and the frustrating&#x2014;is fascinating.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Rita Golden Gelman, author of <i>Tales of a Female Nomad</i>&nbsp;<br><br></b>&#x201c;In&nbsp;<i>Chasing Chaos</i>, Alexander takes us to a place where few outsiders can go, cracking open the rarefied world of humanitarianism to bare its contradictions&#x2014;and her own&#x2014;with boldness and humor. The result is an immensely valuable field guide to the mind of that uniquely powerful and vulnerable of beasts: the international aid worker.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Jonathan M.

Another thrill is how much historical fiction actually reveals about the time period in which it is written&#x2014;the preoccupations and focuses of revisionist history, for example, shift as our contemporary moment shifts.

What was it like to be attached to a project you weren&#x2019;t allowed any knowledge of? How did such a world-changing invention change you, your marriage, your family? These are the questions Nesbit tackles in this stunning novel, both concise and elliptical. In style, it echoes Julie Otsuka&#x2019;s <em>The Buddha in the Attic</em> (also a first-person-plural account, of the Japanese internment in WWII.) Also like that book, it sheds light on historical events too rarely discussed in literature. This debut is a tour-de-force, in a quiet, careful and winning way. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p></p><h2>The Admissions</h2><p>The Hawthorne family has it all: great jobs, a beautiful house in one of the most affluent areas of northern California, and three charming kids with perfectly straight teeth.&nbsp; Then comes eldest daughter Angela&#x2019;s senior year of high school.<br>&nbsp;<br>Suddenly, everyone is floundering.

I&#x2019;m in the security office at the Golden Gate Bridge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;<i>what</i>?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know how to get here, Mrs. Hawthorne?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She couldn&#x2019;t say another thing. The room was whirling. She sat down on one of the kitchen stools.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen carefully, please. I&#x2019;m going to tell you how to get here, and I want you to come right away. Do you understand me? We&#x2019;re on the south side of the bridge. From where you are you have to cross the bridge to get to us.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She swallowed, tried to breathe. She watched a hand that didn&#x2019;t seem like hers grasp at the edge of the counter. She watched the fingers try and fail to grip the edge. There was a sharp sound all around her, a high-pitched noise three octaves beyond glass breaking.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Hawthorne?<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mmmmmmph.&nbsp;</i>The only sound she could manage.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Later Nora would figure that it all started with her job. If she hadn&#x2019;t been a working mother. If the situation with the Watkins home hadn&#x2019;t happened, and then the horror show at the Millers&#x2019; house. If she&#x2019;d been more available, more aware. If she&#x2019;d been better.&nbsp;<i>If if if.</i><br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>&nbsp;<br><i>Three months earlier&nbsp;. . .</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Chapter 1<br>&nbsp;<br>ANGELA&nbsp;</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In the front of the house the rest of the family went about their business. It was early September, a shade past Labor Day. If Angela Hawthorne had to put the situation into words that her AP English teacher, Ms. Simmons, would appreciate, she might say that&nbsp;<i>the moon was picking its way across the sky.&nbsp;</i>The school year was&nbsp;<i>still&nbsp;a virgin: barely touched, unsullied.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above Angela&#x2019;s desk, tacked to the colossal bulletin board, was a calendar. Circled with a red marker snatched from Maya&#x2019;s room (seven-year-olds had a lot of markers) was the date. November first, fewer than eight weeks away. Her mother had added the rest for Angela with a black ballpoint in her neat, Catholic-girl-school hand, using exactly the words on the website:&nbsp;<i>deadline for all early-action application&nbsp;materials.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eight weeks. Seven and a half, really. So much to do. Five AP classes this year: European History. English Literature and Composition. Chemistry. Statistics. Studio Art. (&#x201c;Studio Art can be an AP class?&#x201d; her father had asked. &#x201c;That seems bogus.&#x201d; Angela, in tacit agreement, said nothing.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The battle for class rank was a bloody one. Its victims were laid out all across the campus of Oakville High and across much of Marin County. Figuratively, of course. Ms. Simmons might appreciate that metaphor. Sammy Marshall, felled by an ill-timed bout of mono the previous spring. (&#x201c;Not his fault,&#x201d; said Angela&#x2019;s mother. &#x201c;The poor thing.&#x201d; Was she smiling when she said that?) Porter Webb, the school&#x2019;s foremost scholar-athlete, already being scouted by the minors. Lots of time on the baseball diamond. (&#x201c;Too&nbsp;much athlete, not enough scholar,&#x201d; said Angela&#x2019;s father ruefully, though it seemed to Angela that part of the rue was manufactured.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment Angela was first. Valedictorian.&nbsp;<i>But the wolves were nipping at her heels.&nbsp;</i>(Did this count as a clichï¿½?)<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wolves were snapping at her feet.&nbsp;</i>Better? Better.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the wolves was Maria Ortiz, poetess extraordinaire, already published in several journals, only some of them obscure, fluent in four languages. (Angela&#x2019;s father: &#x201c;Technically, are we counting the Spanish as a foreign language? Because she&nbsp;<i>did&nbsp;</i>grow up speaking it at home . . .&#x201d;) Henrietta Faulkner (no relation, though if you didn&#x2019;t ask, Henrietta didn&#x2019;t offer), Angela&#x2019;s erstwhile best friend.&nbsp;<i>Erstwhile.&nbsp;</i>SAT word.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angela, are the class rankings out yet?</i><br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask Angela. Angela&nbsp;will know the answer. Angela knows everything. Angela, did you do your homework?</i><br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angela,&nbsp;did you practice?</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And already, in the first week of school, a paper due in AP English Lit, as though the two novels Angela read in August for summer course work weren&#x2019;t enough. It didn&#x2019;t seem fair. &#x201c;But I also have to say, for the umpty-umpth time, that life isn&#x2019;t fair. It&#x2019;s just fairer than death, that&#x2019;s all,&#x201d; said Cecily over dinner&#x2014;an aphorism she&#x2019;d picked up from&nbsp;<i>The Princess Bride,&nbsp;</i>which she&#x2019;d spent countless hours of the summer watching with her best friend, Pinkie. At ten years old, Cecily and Pinkie seemed to have an unlimited supply of leisure time with which to watch movies and ride scooters and twist each other&#x2019;s hair into unnatural shapes to see how long they held.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where was Angela&#x2019;s leisure time? Gone, vanished<i>.&nbsp;Taken from her in the night by an invisible thief.&nbsp;</i>Wait, a thief couldn&#x2019;t actually be invisible.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stolen&nbsp;in the night by an unknown assailant.&nbsp;</i>Corny. Overwritten. And assailants didn&#x2019;t necessarily steal, they might just attack.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purloined.&nbsp;</i>Better. Simple and elegant. SAT word.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, more likely, if memory served, Angela&#x2019;s free time had never truly existed. Perhaps, eons ago, when she was an infant, reclining in the Moses basket that her mother kept in the attic, the only remaining relic of Angela&#x2019;s and Cecily&#x2019;s and Maya&#x2019;s babyhoods. Maybe then Angela had had leisure time, though a foggy memory persisted of a swinging ball of red and black and white, something she was meant to study and perhaps learn from. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m saving it,&#x201d; said Angela&#x2019;s mother (about the Moses basket). &#x201c;For&nbsp;one of you. For when you have your own.&#x201d; And Angela nodded, absorbing this sentiment, while in truth she couldn&#x2019;t imagine ever marrying or becoming a mother. Where, on earth, would she find the time?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were expected to read all of&nbsp;<i>Beloved&nbsp;</i>and write a paper on its central theme. By tomorrow. Angela hadn&#x2019;t begun the book yet, never mind the paper. Cross-country practice after school, the first meet only two weeks away, six-by-one-mile repeats through the woods and over the river.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the river and through the woods, to grandmother&#x2019;s house . . .&nbsp;</i>Angela&#x2019;s only living grandmother was her mother&#x2019;s mother; she lived in Rhode Island, nowhere accessible by horse-drawn sleigh. (Was anywhere?) Eight thirty.&nbsp;<i>The fatigue was pulling at her eyelids.&nbsp;</i>(Good?&nbsp;<i>The fatigue&nbsp;was&nbsp;like a blanket . . .&nbsp;</i>No. Too much. Pulling at the eyelids was better.) Again Angela looked at the calendar: November first. Not so long now, not so long.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should she?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She never had before, hadn&#x2019;t wanted to, hadn&#x2019;t needed to, though she kept them at the ready. They all did&#x2014;for emergencies, or not, as the case may be. Angela had gotten hers from Henrietta Faulkner, who had gotten them God-knows-where. A harmless little study aid, no big deal. A few of them secreted inside an Advil bottle, the bottle tucked inside her desk drawer, behind the pencil sharpener, the old iPod, no longer working, long since replaced, the odd collection of shoelaces.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angela pulled out the bottle and shook the capsule out into her hand. Five milligrams, not so much. Other kids used more. Lots more. Five was nothing, a baby dose. A warm-up, an appetizer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She reached for the glass of water at the edge of her desk. Hydration was super-important after a workout like the one they&#x2019;d had today. Were the varsity cross-country teams at Novato and Redwood and all across the county working as hard as they were, as hard as the mighty Warriors? It was difficult to say. They would find out when they went head to head in November, at the regional meet. Foot to foot.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lifted the glass, drank. The capsule was so small she scarcely noticed it going down. It was a blip, a hiccup.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She waited. Nothing. She waited some more. And more. And longer. There it was. Her head cleared. It all faded to the background: the<br><i>screech-scritch&nbsp;</i>of Cecily&#x2019;s bow across the strings (&#x201c;Practice makes perfect,&#x201d; Cecily said cheerfully, though there was little evidence that Angela could&nbsp;find to confirm the&nbsp;<i>veracity&nbsp;</i>of that statement, at least in Cecily&#x2019;s case. Although those same words had been repeated to Angela ad nauseam for the past seventeen years), the sounds of the television, the neighbor&#x2019;s dog barking at the back door to be let in or out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There it was. Tunnel focus, that&#x2019;s what they called it. And for good reason. Angela Hawthorne, valedictorian, was staring down a tunnel, no stopping, no sleep until Cambridge.<br><i>You get there, and then you can rest. Then you can rest.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But not yet, not now. Now she would work until it was done, and then she would&nbsp;<i>sleep under a crimson moon.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Chapter &nbsp;2<br>&nbsp;<br>NORA&nbsp;</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4:44&nbsp;a.m.</i><br><i>Dear&nbsp;Marianne:</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Do you&nbsp;know I thought about seeing a therapist?

Here, she relates the stories of nature's most remarkable creatures, including the familial orcas in the waters of Washington State and British Columbia; the migratory humpbacks; the ancient, deep-diving blue whales, the largest animals on the planet. The lives of these whales are conveyed through the work of dedicated researchers who have spent decades tracking them along their secretive routes that extend for thousands of miles, gleaning their habits and sounds and distinguishing peculiarities. The author invites the reader onto a small research catamaran maneuvering among 100-foot long blue whales off the coast of California; or to join the task of monitoring patterns of humpback whale movements at the ocean surface: <i>tail throw</i>, <i>flipper slap</i>, <i>fluke up</i>, or <i>blow</i>. To experience whales is breathtaking. To understand their lives deepens our connection with the natural world.</p><p>Leigh Calvez has worked with whales and dolphins as a scientist, naturalist, and nature writer. As a scientist, she was Research Director for the Ocean Mammal Institute on such projects as the effect of vessel traffic on endangered humpback whales off Maui, Hawaii. She also led the only independent research team observing the US Navy&#39;s testing of Low Frequency Active Sonar on humpback whales in their nurseries in Hawaii in 1998. As a naturalist, Leigh has worked on whale watch boats in Massachusetts watching humpback and finback whales on the feeding grounds of Stellwagen Bank, in Hawaii on the breeding grounds of the humpback whale, and in the San Juan Islands of Washington State, watching pods of orca whales. She has also led extended whale watching journeys to New Zealand, British Columbia, and the Azores Islands off Portugal.<b>Praise for <i>The Breath of a Whale</i>:</b><br><br>"<i>The Breath of a Whale</i>&nbsp;is as intimate and spirited as its title. This splendid book offers us the whale watch most of us can only dream of: We get close-up and personal with wild giants, in the company of an expert who feels like a good friend.

I made the trip from Pasterway on a regular basis, as I had affairs to monitor in the city. Those trips, however, were not well-publicized&#x2014;by which I mean I mentioned them to only a handful of people, all of them discreet. So far as most of Scirland knew (those few who cared to know), I was a recluse, and had been so since my return from Vystrana. <br>I was permitted reclusiveness on account of my personal troubles, though in reality I spent more of my time on work: first the publication of our Vystrani research, and then preparation for this Erigan expedition, which had been delayed and delayed again, by forces far beyond our control. On that Graminis morning, however, I could no longer escape the social obligations I assiduously buried beneath those other tasks. The best I could do was to discharge them both in quick succession: to visit first my blood relations, and then those bound to me by marriage. <br>My house in Pasterway was only a short drive from the fashionable district of Havistow, where my eldest brother Paul had settled the prior year. I usually escaped the necessity of visiting his house by the double gift of his frequent absence and his wife&#x2019;s utter disinterest in me, but on this occasion I had been invited, and it would have been more trouble to refuse. <br>Please understand, it is not that I disliked my family. Most of us got on cordially enough, and I was on quite good terms with Andrew, the brother most immediately senior to me. But the rest of my brothers found me baffling, to say the least, and my mother&#x2019;s censure of my behaviour had nudged their opinions toward disapproval. What Paul wanted with me that day I did not know&#x2014;but on the whole, I would have preferred to face a disgruntled Vystrani rock-wyrm. <br>Alas, those were all quite far away, while my brother was too near to avoid. With a sensation of girding for battle, I lifted my skirt in ladylike delicacy, climbed the front steps, and rang the bell. <br>My sister-in-law was in the morning room when the footman escorted me in. Judith was a paragon of upper-class Scirling wifehood, in all the ways I was not: beautifully dressed, without crossing the line into gyver excess; a gracious hostess, facilitating her husband&#x2019;s work by social means; and a dedicated mother, with three children already, and no doubt more to come. <br>We had precisely one thing in common, which was Paul. &#x201c;Have I called at the wrong time?&#x201d; I inquired, after accepting a cup of tea. <br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; Judith answered. &#x201c;He is not at home just now&#x2014;a meeting with Lord Melst&#x2014;but you are welcome to stay until he returns.&#x201d; <br>Lord Melst? Paul <i>was</i> moving up in the world. &#x201c;I presume this is Synedrion business,&#x201d; I said. <br>Judith nodded. &#x201c;We had a short respite after he won his chair, but now the affairs of government have moved in to occupy his time. I hardly expect to see him between now and Gelis.&#x201d; <br>Which meant I might be cooling my heels here for a very long time. &#x201c;If it is not too much trouble,&#x201d; I said, putting down my teacup and rising from my seat, &#x201c;I think it might be better for me to leave and come back. I have promised to pay a visit to my brother-in-law Matthew today as well.&#x201d; <br>To my surprise, Judith put out her hand to stop me. &#x201c;No, please stay. We have a guest right now, who was hoping to see you&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>I never had the chance to ask who the guest was, though I had my suspicions the moment Judith began to speak. The door to the sitting room opened, and my mother came in. <br>Now it all made sense. I had ceased to answer my mother&#x2019;s letters some time before, for my own peace of mind. She would not, even when asked, leave off criticizing my every move, and implying that my bad judgment had caused me to lose my husband in Vystrana. It was not courteous to ignore her, but the alternative would be worse. For her to see me, therefore, she must either show up unannounced at my house&nbsp;&#x2026; or lure me to another&#x2019;s. <br>Such logic did little to sweeten my reaction. Unless my mother was there to offer reconciliation&#x2014;which I doubted&#x2014;this was a trap. I had rather pull my own teeth out than endure more of her recriminations. (And lest you think that a mere figure of speech, I should note that I <i>did</i> once pull my own tooth out, so I do not make the comparison lightly.) <br>As it transpired, though, her recriminations were at least drawing on fresh material. My mother said, &#x201c;Isabella. What is this nonsense I hear about you going to Eriga?&#x201d; <br>I have been known to bypass the niceties of small talk, and ordinarily I am grateful for it in others. In this instance, however, it had the effect of an arrow shot from cover, straight into my brain. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; I said, quite stupidly&#x2014;not because I failed to understand her, but because I had no idea how she had come to hear of it. <br>&#x201c;You know perfectly well what I mean,&#x201d; she went on, relentlessly. &#x201c;It is <i>absurd,</i> Isabella. You cannot go abroad again, and <i>certainly</i> not to any part of Eriga. They are at war there!&#x201d; <br>I sought my chair once more, using the delay to regain my composure. &#x201c;That is an exaggeration, Mama, and you know it. Bayembe is not at war. The mansa of Talu dares not invade, not with Scirling soldiers helping to defend the borders.&#x201d; <br>My mother sniffed. &#x201c;I imagine the man who drove the Akhians out of Elerqa&#x2014;after two hundred years!&#x2014;dares a great deal indeed. And even if <i>he</i> does not attack, what of those dreadful Ikwunde?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The entire jungle of Mouleen lies between them and Bayembe,&#x201d; I said, irritated. &#x201c;Save at the rivers, of course, and Scirland stands guard there as well. Mama, the whole point of our military presence is to make the place safe.&#x201d; <br>The look she gave me was dire. &#x201c;Soldiers do not make a place safe, Isabella. They only make it less dangerous.&#x201d; <br>What skill I have in rhetoric, I inherited from my mother. I was in no mood to admire her phrasing that day, though. Nor to be pleased at her political awareness, which was quite startling. Most Scirling women of her class, and a great many men, too, could barely name the two Erigan powers that had forced Bayembe to seek foreign&#x2014;which is to say Scirling&#x2014;aid. Gentlemen back then were interested only in the lopsided &#x201c;trade agreement&#x201d; that sent Bayembe iron to Scirland, along with other valuable resources, in exchange for them allowing us to station our soldiers all over their country, and build a colony in Nsebu. Ladies were not interested much at all. <br>Was this something she had attended to before, or had she educated herself upon hearing of my plans? Either way, this was not how I had intended to break the news to her. Just how I <i>had</i> intended to do it, I had not yet decided; I kept putting off the issue, out of what I now recognized as rank cowardice. And this was the consequence: an unpleasant confrontation in front of my sister-in-law, whose stiffly polite expression told me that she had known this was coming. <br>(A sudden worm of suspicion told me that Paul, too, had known. Meeting with Lord Melst, indeed. Such a <i>shame</i> he was out when I arrived.) <br>It meant, at least, that I only had to face my mother, without allies to support her in censure. I was not fool enough to think I would have had allies of my own. I said, &#x201c;The Foreign Office would not allow people to travel there, let alone settle, if it were so dangerous as all that. And they <i>have</i> been allowing it, so there you are.&#x201d; She did not need to know that one of the recurrent delays in this expedition had involved trying to persuade the Foreign Office to grant us visas. &#x201c;Truly, Mama, I shall be at far more risk from malaria than from any army.&#x201d; <br>What possessed me to say that, I do not know, but it was sheer idiocy on my part. My mother&#x2019;s glare sharpened. &#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; she said, and the word could have frosted glass. &#x201c;Yet you propose to go to a place teeming with tropical diseases, without a single <i>thought</i> for your son.&#x201d; <br>Her accusation was both fair and not. It was true that I did not think as much of my son as one might expect. I gave very little milk after his birth and had to hire a wet-nurse, which suited me all too well; infant Jacob reminded me far too much of his late namesake. Now he was more than two years old, weaned, and in the care of a nanny. My marriage settlement had provided quite generously for me, but much of that money I had poured into scientific research, and the books of our Vystrani expedition&#x2014;the scholarly work under my husband&#x2019;s name, and my own inane bit of travel writing&#x2014;were not bringing in as much as one might hope. Out of what remained, however, I paid handsomely for someone to care for my son, and not because the widow of a baronet&#x2019;s second son ought not to stoop to such work herself. I simply did not know what to do with Jacob otherwise. <br>People often suppose that maternal wisdom is wholly instinctual: that however ignorant a woman may be of child rearing prior to giving birth, the mere fact of her sex will afterward endow her with perfect capability. This is not true even on the grossest biological level, as the failure of my milk had proved, and it is even less true in social terms. In later years I have come to understand children from the perspective of a natural historian; I know their development, and have some appreciation for its marvellous progress. But at that point in time, little Jacob made less sense to me than a dragon. <br>Is the rearing of a child best performed by a woman who has done it before, who has honed her skills over the years and enjoys her work, or by a woman with no skill and scant enjoyment, whose sole qualification is a direct biological connection? My opinion fell decidedly on the former, and so I saw very little practical reason why I should not go to Eriga. In <i>that</i> respect, I had given a great deal of thought to the matter of my son. <br>Saying such things to my mother was, however, out of the question. Instead I temporized. &#x201c;Matthew Camherst and his wife have offered to take him in while I am gone. Bess has one of her own, very near the same age; it will be good for Jacob to have a companion.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And if you die?&#x201d; <br>The question dropped like a cleaver onto the conversation, severing it short. I felt my cheeks burning: with anger, or with shame&#x2014;likely both. I was outraged that my mother should say such a thing so bluntly&nbsp;&#x2026; and yet my husband had died in Vystrana. It was not impossible that I should do the same in Eriga. <br>Into this dead and bleeding silence came a knock on the door, followed shortly by the butler, salver in hand, bowing to present a card to Judith, who lifted it, mechanically, as if she were a puppet and someone had pulled the string on her arm. Confusion carved a small line between her brows. &#x201c;Who is Thomas Wilker?&#x201d; <br>The name had the effect of a low, unnoticed kerb at the edge of a street, catching my mental foot and nearly causing me to fall on my face. &#x201c;Thomas Wil&#x2014;what is <i>he</i> doing here?&#x201d; Comprehension followed, tardily, lifting me from my stumble. Judith did not know him, and neither did my mother, which left only one answer. &#x201c;Ah. I think he must be here to see me.&#x201d; <br>Judith&#x2019;s posture snapped to a rigid, upright line, for this was <i>not</i> how social calls were conducted. A man should not inquire after a widow in a house that wasn&#x2019;t hers. I spared a moment to notice that the card, which Judith dropped back on the salver, was not a proper calling card; it appeared to be a piece of paper with Mr. Wilker&#x2019;s name written in by hand. Worse and worse. Mr. Wilker was not, properly speaking, a gentleman, and certainly not the sort of person who would call here in the normal course of things. <br>I did what I could to retrieve the moment. &#x201c;I do apologize. Mr. Wilker is an assistant to the earl of Hilford&#x2014;you recall him, of course; he is the one who arranged the Vystrani expedition.&#x201d; And was arranging the Erigan one, too, though his health precluded him from accompanying us. But what business of that could be so urgent that Lord Hilford would send Mr. Wilker after me at my brother&#x2019;s house? &#x201c;I should speak with him, but there&#x2019;s no need to trouble you. I will take my leave.&#x201d; <br>My mother&#x2019;s outstretched hand stopped me before I could stand. &#x201c;Not at all. I think we&#x2019;re all eager to hear what this Mr. Wilker has to say.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; Judith said faintly, obeying the unspoken order woven through my mother&#x2019;s words. &#x201c;Send him in, Londwin.&#x201d; <br>The butler bowed and retired. By the alacrity with which Mr. Wilker appeared, he must have sprang forward the instant he was welcomed in; agitation still showed in his movements. But he had long since taken pains to cultivate better manners than those he had grown up with, and so he presented himself first to Judith. &#x201c;Good morning, Mrs. Hendemore. My name is Thomas Wilker. I&#x2019;m sorry to trouble you, but I have a message for Mrs. Camherst. We must have passed one another on the road; I only just missed her at her house. And I&#x2019;m afraid the news is unfortunate enough that it could not wait. I was told she would be visiting here.&#x201d; <br>The curt, disjointed way in which he delivered these words made my hands tighten in apprehension. Mr. Wilker was, quite rightly, looking only at Judith, save a brief nod when he spoke my name; with no hint forthcoming from him, I found myself exchanging a glance instead with my mother. <br>What I saw there startled me. <i>We&#x2019;re all eager to hear what this Mr. Wilker has to say</i>&#x2014;she thought he was my lover! An overstatement, perhaps, but she had the expression of a woman looking for signs of inappropriate attachment, and coming up empty-handed. <br>As well she should. Mr. Wilker and I might no longer be at loggerheads the way we had been in Vystrana, but I felt no romantic affection for him, nor he for me. Our relationship was purely one of business. <br>I wanted to set my mother down in no uncertain terms for harboring such thoughts, but forbore. Not so much because of the sheer inappropriateness of having that conversation in public, but because it occurred to me that Mr. Wilker and I were engaged in <i>two</i> matters of business, of which the Erigan expedition was only one. <br>Judith, fortunately, waved Mr. Wilker on before I could burst out with my questions unbidden. &#x201c;By all means, Mr. Wilker. Or is your message private?&#x201d; <br>I would not have taken the message privately for a hundred sovereigns, not with such suspicions in my mother&#x2019;s mind. &#x201c;Please,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What has happened?&#x201d; <br>Mr. Wilker blew out a long breath, and the urgency drained from him in a sudden rush, leaving him sagging and defeated. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s been a break-in at Kemble&#x2019;s.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Kemble&#x2019;s&nbsp;&#x2026; oh, no.&#x201d; My own shoulders sagged, a mirror to his. &#x201c;What did they destroy? Or&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>He nodded, grimly. &#x201c;Took. His notes.&#x201d; <br>Theft, not destruction. Someone knew what Kemble was working on, and was determined to steal it for their own. <br>I slumped back in my chair, ladylike dignity the furthest thing from my mind. Frederick Kemble was the chemist Mr. Wilker had hired&#x2014;or rather <i>I</i> had hired; the money was mine, although the choice of recipient was his&#x2014;to continue the research we ourselves had stolen in the mountains of Vystrana, three years ago. Research that documented a method for preserving dragonbone: an amazing substance, strong and light, but one that decayed quickly outside a living body. <br>The Chiavoran who developed that method was not the first one ...</p><h2>Too Many Frogs</h2><p>Rabbit lives alone. He cooks for himself, cleans up for himself, and at the end of the day, reads himself a story. It's a simple life, and he likes it. But one evening, Froggie shows up at his door. He wants to listen to Rabbit's story, too. While eating a snack-or three. While lounging on a pillow-or ten. And bringing over his family-dozens and dozens of frogs! Rabbit has finally had enough; Froggie will have to go! But when he sits down alone to read himself a story, Rabbit realizes something is missing: someone to listen; someone to share a wonderful story.<br> Keith Graves' boisterous, humor-filled artwork lends just the right touch to this multilayered tale that celebrates the joy of reading aloud.</p><p>Sandy Asher is the author of twenty books for young readers and more than three dozen plays. She is also the editor or co-editor of five collections of fiction, including <i>Dude!

His guest loves to listen to this big blue rabbit with oversized ears read a story and likes it even more when he has prepared himself a snack or gotten cozy&#x2013;night after night. Polite Rabbit refrains from refusing entry until Froggie shows up with his entire family. As he settles himself down to read alone, however, he realizes that he misses Froggie and invites the whole crew in. The humorous illustrations create empathy for Rabbit but also for Froggie, who is genuinely delighted to listen to a story. The varied facial expressions lend credence to the adage "A picture is worth a thousand words." The simple text may say "but before he could begin, there was that knock-knockety-knocking again!" but the horror on Rabbit's face is priceless. A fun story that celebrates reading and standing up for oneself.<i>&#x2013;Linda M.

Joyce shows you uncomplicated ways to work with landscape-themed fabrics to make a quilted wallhanging you&#39;ll be proud to show off. Quickly build an eye-catching scene using her popular techniques for painting, fusing, embellishing, and embroidering.</p><p>Drawing on her life-long love of nature, this award-winning quilt artist says she studies nature as though she is looking through the lens of a camera, setting up possible landscape scenes in her mind for future reference. Her inspirations come from many sources including photographs, greeting cards, and photography books. Joyce incorporates many original, unique, and sometimes unorthodox surface design techniques to impart realism in her landscape quilts. The author of Nature&#39;s Patterns: Inspirations and Techniques for Quilt Makers, Joyce became enamored with the landscape genre in 1995 after making a series of landscape watercolor quilts. Because she wanted her landscape quilts to impart realism, Joyce quickly realized she would have to &#34;invent&#34; a method to create landscape quilts in a non-traditional format. Through trial and error, her original methodology eventually evolved into a fun and easy process. Feeling blessed to have such a creative profession, Joyce focuses her art, writing, teaching, and lecturing on landscape quilts and volunteers throughout the quilting community. She was a founding board member and now an active volunteer of the Association of Pacific Northwest Quilters, sponsors of the bi-annual regional Pacific Northwest QuiltFest exhibit in Seattle, Washington. Joyce is also an active member of the Contemporary Quilt Art Association of Seattle, Washington; the Evergreen Piecemakers Quilt Guild of Kent, Washington; the International Quilt Association; and the American Quilter&#39;s Society. Joyce&#39;s quilts have been displayed internationally in contests and invitational exhibits, appearing in books, magazines, and on television. Many articles authored by Joyce have appeared in mainstream quilting magazines, and she has also been featured on HGTV&#39;s Simply Quilts. The Auburn Arts Commission sponsored her first solo exhibit, held in Auburn, Washington, in 2001. A California native, Joyce has resided in Kent, Washington, since 1985, where she enjoys spending time with her husband, Donald. In additional to their two sons and a daughter-in-law, Joyce has five grown stepchildren (who affectionately call her &#34;step-monster&#34;) and five grandchildren. In her spare time, Joyce enjoys hanging out with her &#34;Thursday Group&#34; quilting buddies, and traveling with her husband. Joyce&#39;s lively sense of humor and positive attitude result in lectures and workshops that inspire, inform, and entertain quilters as she travles throughout the world.

But today the field of personality science has moved well beyond the nature vs. nurture debate. In <i>Who Are You, Really?</i> Dr. Brian Little presents a distinctive view of how personality shapes our lives&#x2014;and why this matters. Little makes the case for a <i>third nature</i> to the human condition&#x2014;the pursuit of personal projects, idealistic dreams, and creative ventures that shape both people&#x2019;s lives and their personalities. Little uncovers what personality science has been discovering about the role of personal projects, revealing how this new concept can help people better understand themselves and shape their lives.<br> <br> In this important work, Little argues that it is essential to devote energy and resources to creative endeavors in a highly focused fashion, even if it takes away from other components of our well-being. This does not mean that we cannot shift from one core project to another in the days of our lives. In fact, it is precisely that ability to flexibly craft projects that is the greatest source of sustainability. Like learning to walk, forcing ourselves out of balance as we step is the only way in which we can move forward. And it is the only way that human flourishing can be enhanced.<br> <br> The well-lived life is based on the sustainable pursuit of core projects in our lives. Ultimately, <i>Who Are You, Really? </i>provides a deeply personal itinerary for exploring our personalities, our lives, and the human condition.</p><p>Dr. Brian Little is an internationally acclaimed scholar and speaker in the field of personality and motivational psychology. He is a Fellow of the Well-Being Institute and Director of the Social Ecology Research Group in the Department of Psychology at Cambridge University. Previously, he taught at McGill, Oxford, and Harvard Universities. Dividing his time between Canada and the UK, Dr. Little is also a Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus at Carleton University in Ottawa, and he lectures worldwide on personality, motivation, and well-being. <i>Who Are You, Really? </i>is his third book.&nbsp;Who Are You, Really? 1<p></p> Scanning Your Personality: The Big Picture<p></p> <br>So, how are you doing? Are you happy? Are you accomplishing the things that matter to you? Are you living up to your capabilities? Are you able to love and be loved? Are you physically well? Is there some laughter in your life? If you answer yes to all such questions, we might say that you are flourishing. If you answer with an emphatic &#x201c;No!&#x201d; or even an eyeball-rolling &#x201c;Seriously, get real,&#x201d; you might be better described as floundering. And in between these extremes, we might find you in the middle, doing reasonably well considering the circumstances.<br> <br>Biogenic traits deeply influence whether you flourish or flounder. You may be temperamentally predisposed to viewing your life positively and optimistically, even though the objective reality that you confront might be rather bleak. Or despite living in a relatively safe, nurturing, and prosperous environment, you may see your life as half empty, or utterly miserable. The forces of nature and nurture that provide answers to &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; are also key to answering the question &#x201c;How are you doing?&#x201d; The relation between these biogenic and sociogenic influences can be simply graphed as:<br> <br> <br> <br>Whether you are flourishing or floundering, in other words, is partly determined by the combination of biogenic and sociogenic sources that impinge on you during the course of your life. These aren&#x2019;t the only influences, but we need to understand how they work before we explore how your personal projects empower you to deliberately design who and how you are. So let us begin with a brief tour through the inner biogenic and the outer sociogenic forces that shape your personality.<br> Personal Zoom: Scanning the Inner You<p></p> <br>Imagine a microscope that dips under your skin and zooms down to reveal your tissues, organelles, cell nuclei, chromosomes, and genes. It darts up to your brain and homes in on a single neuron firing a squirt of neurotransmitters and the explosion of activity in associated cells. It then zooms out to focus on the physical body reading this book wondering about who it is and how it&#x2019;s doing. This &#x201c;it&#x201d; is the biogenic you.<br> <br>Within personality psychology, those who study the biogenic perspective explore how your relatively stable personality traits influence your quality of life. These stable traits correspond to differences in brain structure and function&#x2014;those microscopic events we just saw when zooming in on the inner you. These biogenic features can be assessed by measures of electrical activity in various regions of your brain or through analyses of patterns of neurotransmitter activity. They can also be revealed through personal genomic analysis, which can now be done for roughly $200. In My Beautiful Genome, the Danish science writer Lone Frank relates the fascinating account of her quest to examine aspects of her personal genome and its links to her health and personality. She discovered that she had a gene variant that predisposed her to negative emotionality and what she most agreeably describes as her &#x201c;own miserably low score on agreeableness.&#x201d;3<br> <br>Some of these biogenic personality traits will incline you toward being happy or healthy or accomplished or, conversely, will explain why you despair over life&#x2019;s various hiccups. Let&#x2019;s say your life is flourishing right now&#x2014;you are happy, healthy, and successful, certainly compared to your mopey best friend, but maybe even in an absolute sense. This may be due to your having biogenic features of temperament and personality that dispose you to adopt a positive outlook. Even when life sucks, your stable dispositions make you resilient and buoyant. You continue to grow and prosper. Indeed, you may have pronoia, the delusional belief that other people are plotting your well-being or saying good things about you behind your back.4 Your friend&#x2019;s stable traits, in comparison, may not be conducive to flourishing at all. She is angry and defiant and unsatisfied, and according to her mother, she was like this from birth. She is temperamentally disposed to being ill-disposed. She flounders.<br> The Big Five: The Original You<p></p> <br>Did you know that it is virtually impossible for you to lick the outside of your own elbow? And did you know, strange as it may sound, that how you responded to that piece of information&#x2014;whether and how you attempted the pursuit&#x2014;might provide a hint about the stable traits you are born with and that form the bedrock of your personality? Let me explain: While there are thousands of ways we might distinguish people on the basis of their traits, personality psychologists have reached a consensus that people vary from one another along five basic dimensions: the Big Five traits. The Big Five have major consequences for how our lives play out.5 If you would like to get a quick assessment of where you stand on these major traits, the Appendix provides some questions that can guide your own self-assessment.</p><h2>The Letter of James (The New International Commentary on the New Testament)</h2><p>Scot McKnight here explains the Letter of James both in its own context and as it may be seen in light of ancient Judaism, the Graeco-Roman world, and emerging earliest Christianity. <br><br>From beginning to end, the book is shaped for pastors, teachers, and scholars.

Right now, those with doubt are outnumbering those with faith. But God only blesses faith. It's "the Christian faith" -not the Christian doubt. <br><br> Are there reasons to trust that God kept His promise to preserve His own words? <br><br> Yes! There are many. <br><br> This book is a small collection of those. People have been finding not only what faith looks like, but have actually made the move and left the doubting Bibles, with their contradictory doctrines, and come to the King James. There they found a consistent message, consistent doctrine, and a consistent faith. <br><br> So they can hold the Bible up in their hands and say, "Thus saith the Lord! This is the words of God." <br><br> Trusting God's words can change your church! The result? An increase in: <br><br> ... Holiness<br> ... Faith<br> ...Soul-winning<br> ... Christian growth<br> ... Confidence in the Scriptures<br><br> It's so important to have a preserved standard of God's words. Otherwise, gradual changes over time will so corrupt the text that it will fit neatly into the globalist goal of one-world Bible for the one-world religion.

If laws are their enemies, they will be enemies to laws.</i><br> -Edmund Burke<br><br> <b>Chapter&nbsp;1<br> </b><br> With the light still cold and gray, the castle came alive. Horses were brought from their stalls and &nbsp;rubbed down; dogs barked and fought with each other, kicked&nbsp;out of the way by those who found them in their path. Hundreds of young men were busy gathering tack and weapons, rushing around the main yard with armfuls of equipment.<br><br> In the great tower, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, stared out of the window to the bustling sward all around his fortress. The castle stones were warm in the August heat, but the old man wore a cloak and mantle of fur around his shoulders even so, clutched tight to his chest. He was still both tall and broad, though age had bowed him down. His sixth decade had brought aches and creaking joints that made all movement painful and his temper short.<br><br> The earl glowered through the leaded glass. The town was waking. The world was rising with the sun and he was ready to act, after so long biding his time. He watched as armored knights assembled, their servants passing out shields that had been painted black, or covered in sackcloth bound with twine. The Percy colors of blue and&nbsp;yellow were nowhere in evidence, hidden from view so that the soldiers waiting for his order had a somber look. For a time, they would be gray men, hedge knights without house or family. Men without honor, when honor was a chain to bind them.<br><br> The old man sniffed, rubbing hard at his nose. The ruse would fool no one, but when the killing was over, he would still be able to claim no Percy knight or archer had been part of it. Most importantly of all, those who might have cried out against him would be cold in the ground.<br> As he stood there, deep in thought, he heard his son approach, the young &nbsp;man&#x2019;s spurred heels clicking and rattling on the wooden floor. The earl looked around, feeling his old heart thump with anticipation.<br><br> &#x201c;God give you good day,&#x201d; Thomas Percy said, bowing. He too allowed his gaze to stray through the window, down to the bustle of the castle grounds below. Thomas raised an eyebrow in silent question and his father grunted, irritated at the footsteps of servants all around.<br><br> &#x201c;Come with me.&#x201d; Without waiting for a reply, the earl swept along the corridor, the force of his authority pulling Thomas along behind him. He reached a doorway to his private chambers and almost dragged his son inside, slamming the door behind them. As Thomas stood and watched, the old man strode jerkily through the rooms, banging doors back and forth as he went. His suspicion showed in the deepening purple of his face, the skin made darker still by a stain of broken veins that stretched right across his cheeks and nose. The earl could never be pale, with that marbling. If it had been earned in strong spirits from over the Scottish border, it suited his mood well enough. Age had not mellowed the old man, though it had dried and hardened him.<br> Satisfied they were alone, the earl came back to his son, still waiting patiently with his back to the door. Thomas Percy, Baron Egremont, stood no taller than his father once had, though without the stoop of age he could see over the old man&#x2019;s head. At thirty-two, Thomas was in the prime of his manhood, his hair black and his forearms thick with sinew and muscle earned over six thousand days of training. As he stood there, he seemed almost to glow with health and strength, his ruddy skin unmarked by scar or disease. Despite the years between them, both men bore the Percy nose, that great wedge that could be seen in dozens of crofts and villages all around Alnwick.<br><br> &#x201c;There, we are private,&#x201d; the earl said at last. &#x201c;She has her ears everywhere, your mother. I cannot even talk to my own son without her people reporting every word.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What news, then?&#x201d; his son replied. &#x201c;I saw the men, gathering swords and bows. Is it the border?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not today. Those damned Scots are quiet, though I don&#x2019;t doubt the Douglas is forever sniffing round my lands. They&#x2019;ll come in winter when they starve, to try and steal my cows. And we&#x2019;ll send them running when they do.&#x201d;<br><br> His son hid his impatience, knowing well that his father could rant about the &#x201c;cunning Douglas&#x201d; for an hour if he was given the chance.<br><br> &#x201c;The &nbsp;men though, father. They &nbsp;have covered &nbsp;the &nbsp;colors. &nbsp;Who threatens us who must be taken by hedge knights?&#x201d;<br><br> His father stood close to him, reaching out and hooking a bony hand over the lip of the leather breastplate to draw him in.<br><br> &#x201c;Your mother&#x2019;s &nbsp;Nevilles, &nbsp;boy, always and&nbsp;<i>forever&nbsp;</i>the Nevilles. Wherever I turn in my distress, there they are, in my path!&#x201d; Earl Percy raised his other hand &nbsp;as he spoke, holding it up with the fingers joined like a beak. He jabbed the air with it, close by his son&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Standing in such numbers they can never be counted. Married into&nbsp;every noble line! Into every house! I have the damned Scots clawing&nbsp;away at my flank, raiding England, burning villages in my own land. If I did not stand against them, if I let but one season pass without killing the young men they send to test me, they would come south like a dam &nbsp;bursting. Where would England be then, without Percy arms to serve her? But the Nevilles care nothing for all that. No, they throw their weight and wealth to York, that&nbsp;<i>pup</i>.&nbsp;He<i>&nbsp;</i>rises, held aloft by Neville hands, while titles and estates of ours are stolen away.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Warden of the West March,&#x201d; his son muttered wearily. He had heard his father&#x2019;s complaints many times before.<br><br> Earl Percy&#x2019;s glare intensified.<br><br> &#x201c;One of many. A title that should have been your brother&#x2019;s, with fifteen hundred &nbsp;pounds a year, until that&nbsp;<i>Neville</i>, Salisbury, was given it. I have swallowed that, boy. I have swallowed him being made chancellor while my king dreams and sleeps and France was lost. I have swallowed so much from them that I find I am stuffed full.&#x201d;<br><br> The old man had drawn his son so close their faces almost touched. He kissed Thomas brief ly on the cheek, letting him go. From long habit, he checked the room around them once more, though they were alone.<br><br> &#x201c;You have good Percy blood in you, Thomas. It will drive your mother&#x2019;s out in time, as I will drive out the Nevilles upon the land. They have been given to me, Thomas, do you understand? By the grace of God, I have been handed a chance to take back all they have stolen. If I were twenty years younger, I would take Windstrike and ride them down myself, but . . . those days are behind.&#x201d; The old man&#x2019;s eyes were almost feverish as he stared up at his son. &#x201c;You must be my right arm in this, Thomas. You must be my sword and flail.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You honor me,&#x201d; Thomas &nbsp;murmured, his &nbsp;voice &nbsp;breaking. &nbsp;As &nbsp;a mere second son, he had grown to his prime with little of the old man&#x2019;s affection. His elder brother, Henry, was away with a thousand&nbsp;men across the border of Scotland, there to raid and burn and weaken&nbsp;the savage clans. Thomas thought of him and knew Henry&#x2019;s absence was the true reason his father had taken him aside. There was no one else to send. Though the knowledge made him bitter, he could not resist the chance to show his worth to the one man he allowed to judge him.<br> &#x201c;Henry has the best of our fighting cocks,&#x201d; his father said, echoing his thoughts. &#x201c;And I must keep some strong &nbsp;hands at Alnwick, in case the cunning Douglas slips your brother and comes south to rape and steal. That little man knows no greater pleasure than in taking what is mine. I swear he&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Father, I will not fail,&#x201d; Thomas said. &#x201c;How many will you send with me?&#x201d;<br><br> His father paused in irritation at being interrupted, his eyes sharp with rebuke. At last, he nodded, letting it go.<br><br> &#x201c;Seven &nbsp;hundred, or thereabouts. &nbsp;Two &nbsp;hundred men-at-arms, though the rest are brickmakers and smiths and common men with bows. You&nbsp;<i>will&nbsp;</i>have Trunning and if you have wit, you will let him advise you&#x2014;and listen well to him. He knows the land around York and he knows the men. Perhaps if you had not spent so much of your youth on drink and whores, I would not doubt you. Whisht! Don&#x2019;t take it hard, boy. There must be a son of mine in this, to give the men heart. But they are&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>men, not yours. Follow Trunning. He will not lead you wrong.&#x201d;<br><br> Thomas flushed, his own anger rising. The thought of the two old men planning out some scheme together brought a tension to his frame that his father noted.<br><br> &#x201c;You understand?&#x201d; Earl Percy snapped. &#x201c;Heed Trunning. That is my order to you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I understand,&#x201d; Thomas said, striving hard to conceal his disappointment. For one moment, he&#x2019;d thought his father might trust him&nbsp;in command, rather than raising his brother, or some other man, over&nbsp;him. He felt the loss of something he&#x2019;d never had.<br><br> &#x201c;Will you tell me then where I must ride for you, or should I ask&nbsp;Trunning for that as well?&#x201d; Thomas said.<br> His voice was strained, and his &nbsp;father&#x2019;s &nbsp;mouth quirked in response, amused and scornful.<br><br> &#x201c;I said not to take it hard, boy. You&#x2019;ve a good right arm and you are my son, but you&#x2019;ve not led, not beyond a few skirmishes. The men do not respect you, as they do Trunning. How could they? He&#x2019;s fought for twenty years, in France and England both. He&#x2019;ll see you safe.&#x201d;<br><br> The earl waited for some sign that his son had accepted the point, but Thomas &nbsp;glowered, wounded &nbsp;and angry. Earl Percy shook his head, going on.<br><br> &#x201c;There is a Neville marriage tomorrow, Thomas, down at Tattershall. Your mother&#x2019;s clan has reached out to bring yet another into their grasp. That preening cockerel, Salisbury, will be there, to see his son wed. They will be at peace, content to take a new bride back to their holding at the manor of Sheriff Hutton. My man told me all, risking his bones to reach me in time. I paid him well for it, mind. Now listen. They will be on horses and on foot, a merry &nbsp;wedding party traipsing back to feast on a fine summer day. And you will be there, Thomas. You will ride them down, leaving no one alive. That is my order to you. Do you understand it?&#x201d;<br><br> Thomas swallowed hard as his father watched him. Earl Salisbury was his mother&#x2019;s brother, the man&#x2019;s sons his own cousins. Thomas had been thinking he would ride out after some weaker branch of the Neville tree, not the root itself and the head of the clan. If he did as he was told, he would make more blood-enemies in a day than in his entire life to that point. Even so, he nodded, unable to trust his voice. His father&#x2019;s mouth twisted sourly, seeing once again his son&#x2019;s weakness and indecision.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Salisbury&#x2019;s boy is marrying Maud Cromwell. You know her uncle&nbsp;holds Percy manors, refusing my claim to them. It seems he thinks he can give&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>estates in dowry to the Nevilles, that they are now so strong &nbsp;I will be forced to drop my suits and cases against him. I am sending you to show them justice. To show them the authority Cromwell f louts as he seeks a greater shadow to hide beneath! Listen to me now. Take my seven hundred &nbsp;and kill them all, Thomas. Be sure Cromwell&#x2019;s niece is among the dead, that I may invoke her name when next &nbsp;I meet her weeping &nbsp;uncle &nbsp;in the &nbsp;king&#x2019;s &nbsp;court. Do you understand?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course I understand!&#x201d; Thomas said, his voice hardening. He felt his hands tremble as he glared at his father, but he would not suffer the old man&#x2019;s scorn by refusing. He set his jaw, the decision made.<br><br> A knock sounded on the door at Thomas&#x2019;s back, making both men start like guilty conspirators. Thomas stood away to let it swing open, blanching at the sight of his mother standing there.<br> His father drew himself up, his chest puffing out.<br><br> &#x201c;Go now, Thomas. Bring honor to your family and your name.&#x201d; &#x201c;<i>Stay</i>, Thomas,&#x201d; his mother said quickly, her expression cold. Thomas hesitated, then dipped his head, slipping past her and<br> striding away. Alone, Countess Eleanor Percy turned sharply to her husband.<br><br> &#x201c;I see your guards and soldiers arming themselves, covering Percy colors. Now my son rushes from me like a whipped cur. Will &nbsp;you have me ask, then? What foul plan have you been whispering into his ears this time, Henry? What have you done?&#x201d;<br><br> Earl Percy took a deep breath, his triumph showing clearly.<br> &#x201c;Were you not listening at the door like a maid, then? I am surprised,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What I have<i>done &nbsp;</i>is no business of yours.&#x201d; As he spoke, he moved to go past her into the corridor &nbsp;outside. Eleanor stepped into his path to stop him, raising her hand against his chest.<br> &nbsp;<br> In response, the earl gripped it cruelly, crushing her fingers so that&nbsp;she cried out. He twisted further, controlling her with a hand on her elbow.<br><br> &#x201c;Please, Henry. My arm . . .&#x201d; she said, gasping.<br><br> He twisted harder at that, making her shriek. In the corridor, he caught a glimpse of a servant hurrying closer and kicked savagely at the door so that it slammed shut. As his wife whimpered, the old man bent her forward, almost doubled over, with his grip tight on her hand and arm.<br><br> &#x201c;I have done no more than your Nevilles would do to me, if I were ever at their mercy,&#x201d; &nbsp;he said into her ear. &#x201c;Did you think I would allow your brother to rise above the Percy name? Chancellor to the Duke of York now, he threatens everything I am, everything I must protect. Do you understand? I took you on to give me sons, a fertile Neville bride. Well, you have done that. Now do not dare ask me the business of my house.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You are&nbsp;<i>hurting&nbsp;</i>me,&#x201d; she said, her face crumpling in anger and pain. &#x201c;You see enemies where there are none. &nbsp;And if you seek my brother, he will see you dead, Henry. Richard will kill you.&#x201d;<br> With a grunt of outrage, her husband heaved her across the room, sending her sprawling across the bed. He was on her before she could rise to her feet, tearing her dress and bawling at her in red-faced rage as he wrenched &nbsp;at the cloth and bared her skin. She sobbed and struggled, but he was infernally strong in his anger, ignoring her nails as she left red lines on his face and arms. He held her down with one hand, exposing the long pale line of her back as he drew his belt from his trousers and doubled it over into a short whip.<br><br> &#x201c;You will not speak to&nbsp;<i>me&nbsp;</i>in such &nbsp;a&nbsp;<i>way</i>, in my own&nbsp;<i>house</i>.&#x201d; He landed blow after blow with the snapping sounds &nbsp;as loud as her desperate cries. No one came, though he went on and on until she was still, no longer struggling. Long red welts seeped blood to stain the&nbsp;fine cloth as he gasped and panted, fat beads of sweat dropping from&nbsp;his nose and brow onto her skin. With grim satisfaction, the earl replaced his belt and left his wife to sob into the coverlet.<br> &nbsp;<br> Servants opened the door to the marshaling yard beyond as Thomas Percy, Baron Egremont, walked out.

Ram&#x2019;s favorite haunt is the fashionable Cairo Snooker Club, whose members strive to emulate English gentility; but his best friends are young intellectuals who devour the works of Sartre and engage in dangerous revolutionary activities to support Egyptian independence. By turns biting and comic, <i>Beer in the Snooker Club </i>&#x2014; the first and only book by Waguih Ghali &#x2014; became a cult classic when it was first published and remains a timeless portrait of a loveable rogue coming of age in turbulent times.</p><p><b>Waguih Ghali</b> was born in Cairo on February 25th, most likely in 1930. He attended high school in Alexandria and then studied abroad in Europe. Fearing political persecution, he fled Egypt in 1958 and lived in London, also spending time in France, Sweden, and Germany. Ghali authored several personal essays, which appeared in <i>The Guardian</i> between 1957 and 1965. He also spent time as a freelance journalist, reporting for the <i>Times</i> of London and the BBC. Following a battle with depression, Ghali committed suicide in London, at the home of his friend and editor Diana Athill, in 1969. <i>Beer in the Snooker Club</i> is his only finished novel.<i>Excerpted from the Introduction</i><br>I N T R O D U C T I O N<br><br>&#x201c;History,&#x201d; Stephen Dedalus says in Ulysses, &#x201c;is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.&#x201d; By the 1960s, this plangent cry was being echoed by many sensitive men and women in Asian and African countries that had only recently entered modern history as sovereign nation-ï¿½states. The passionate idealism of anti-ï¿½imperialist movements and the longing for justice and dignity that went into the making of many new nations had been compromised by the corruption and ineptitude of the first generation of rulers. The futile cycle of coups and countercoups, and the long game of musical chairs between military strongmen and civilian politicians, had already begun. &#x201c;The politics that came,&#x201d; writes the disenchanted Caribbean narrator of V. S. Naipaul&#x2019;s The Mimic Men (1967), &#x201c;made people aware of their pain. Later they came to see their helplessness.&#x201d; <br><br>Few people felt more vulnerable to this postcolonial chaos than members of the property-ï¿½owning classes. These local elites had prospered during European rule, often as collaborators in a system of exploitation. Educated in Western or Western-ï¿½style institutions, they had become emotionally and spiritually, as well as materially, dependent on the European metropolis, all the while growing aloof from the rest of their compatriots. After independence, they tended to see their often expensive lifestyles, no less than their power, menaced by newly assertive political movements of peasants, factory workers, and ambitious military officers. And even the most altruistic and perceptive of these native aristocrats found themselves thwarted by their remoteness from ordinary lives. <br><br>Alienation was, for them, more than a pose cheaply borrowed, along with black turtlenecks, from French existentialists. It stultified private life&#x2014;ï¿½a realm often defined by quietly desperate love affairs with European men and women&#x2014;ï¿½as well as political gestures. The Mimic Men, detailing a career &#x201c;sunk in the taint of fantasy,&#x201d; was among the extraordinary spate of novels and films in Asia, Africa, and Latin America&#x2014;ï¿½from Driss Chraï¿½bi&#x2019;s Heirs to the Past and Tayeb Salih&#x2019;s Season of Migration to the North to the film Memories of Underdevelopment by Cuban Tomï¿½s Gutiï¿½rrez Alea&#x2014;ï¿½that diagnosed the failure and premature exhaustion of the most privileged and talented young men and women before the arduous challenges of revolution, nation building, and self-ï¿½renewal. But the work of art from this era that has effortlessly assumed the authority of a classic, and has actually felt more prescient and moving since the Arab Spring, is Waguih Ghali&#x2019;s Beer in the Snooker Club.<br><br>Little is known about Ghali except that he was born into a well-ï¿½off family of Coptic Christians and seems to have known intimately the radical postures and precarious bohemianism that his only novel describes with perfectly balanced harshness and solicitude. His true literary predecessor, in many ways, is Albert Cossery, who was from a Greek Orthodox bourgeois family in Cairo and who wrote in French. Cossery denounced the modern world altogether in fictions that upheld a strategic indolence as the correct response to its imperatives to think and work hard. Even the most politicized Egyptian in Cossery&#x2019;s 1948 novel, Laziness in the Fertile Valley, wonders, &#x201c;Why did [men] have to struggle, always vicious and discontented, when the sole wisdom lay in a careless, passive attitude?&#x201d; But Ghali belonged, like his first-ï¿½person narrator, Ram, to a generation of listless youth that had been galvanized by the overthrow of Egypt&#x2019;s cravenly pro-ï¿½British monarch Farouk in 1952 and the advent of the pan-ï¿½Arab nationalist Gamal Abdel Nasser. &#x201c;The only important thing,&#x201d; Ram says, &#x201c;which happened to us was the Egyptian revolution.&#x201d; Yet, as his account goes on to show with unsentimental insight and acid humor, this was yet another revolution that&#x2014;ï¿½as Milan Kundera wrote in Life Is Elsewhere, another 1960s fiction about the fantasies of the romantic intellectual&#x2014;ï¿½had &#x201c;no desire to be examined or analyzed, it only desires that the people merge with it; in this sense it is lyrical and in need of lyricism.&#x201d; <br><br>Revolution may have been the opiate of the brighter demimonde, but Egypt in the 1950s did possess its conditions. Its cities, especially Cairo, were overwhelmed by a massive influx of people who had fled rural subsistence economies only to face unemployment and the degradation of life in slums. The national economy was dominated by a large class of coldhearted landlords, rent seekers, and businessmen who ferreted their profits abroad rather than reinvesting them in the country. One of the wonders of Beer in the Snooker Club is the delicacy with which Ghali sketches a background of deprivation and anger into the confusions of a parochial elite. In what is essentially an account of drift and futility, Ghali&#x2014;ï¿½a card-carrying Communist&#x2014;ï¿½is always clear about the fate of the insulted and injured people he wanted to care for.<br>The novel opens with Ram&#x2019;s aunt, a member of the &#x201c;cosmopolitan&#x201d; feudal class, or &#x201c;parasites,&#x201d; as Ram&#x2019;s friend Font calls them, selling surplus land to the fellaheen and &#x201c;pretending to the government she was giving the land to the poor.&#x201d; These are the Cairenes who, having migrated spiritually to the European metropolis, won&#x2019;t bother to learn Arabic and despise the celebrated singer Umm Kulthum. Ram himself is shown to be initially indifferent to the inequities of his society. &#x201c;I was neither Red, Pink, Blue, nor Black. I had no politics in me then.&#x201d; His political&#x2014;ï¿½and sentimental&#x2014;ï¿½education is initiated by Edna, a Jewish member of Cairo&#x2019;s upper class.<br><br>Unlike Ram, Edna has successfully rebelled against her comprador origins. &#x201c;I hate Egyptians of your class as much as I do my parents,&#x201d; she tells Ram. &#x201c;It was Edna who introduced me to Egyptian people,&#x201d; Ram writes, adding, &#x201c;it is rare, in the milieu in which I was born, to know Egyptians.&#x201d; He and his close friend Font hungrily start to read the books she suggests. She initiates them into the cruelties of European imperialism, and the struggles for freedom waged across the postcolonial world. &#x201c;Gradually, we began to see ourselves as members of humanity in general and not just as Egyptians.&#x201d; One symptom of political awakening in the postcolonial world during the 1950s was anti-ï¿½Americanism: Ram and Font share a &#x201c;vehement phobia towards Egyptians who read the American Time Magazine.&#x201d; When Ram&#x2019;s America-ï¿½returned cousin Mounir claims that &#x201c;American Democracy is the thing&#x201d; and pontificates about the &#x201c;Red Menace,&#x201d; he finds himself violently challenged by Edna&#x2019;s intellectual protï¿½gï¿½ Ram, who has since picked up a lot of information about the plight of blacks and Native Americans in Freedom&#x2019;s Land. <br><br>Yet Ram can&#x2019;t help sense some falsity in his new role as a firebrand, and his exposure to the big world outside Egypt also breeds a different kind of appetite for life elsewhere.<br><br>The world of ice and snow in winter and red, slanting roof-ï¿½tops was beginning to call us. The world of intellectuals and underground metros and cobbled streets and a green countryside which we had never seen, beckoned to us. The world where students had rooms and typists for girl-ï¿½friends, and sang songs and drank beer in large mugs, shouted to us. . .&nbsp;. I wanted to live. I read and read and Edna spoke and I wanted to live. I wanted to have affairs with countesses and to fall in love with a barmaid and to be a gigolo and to be a political leader to win at Monte Carlo and to be down-ï¿½and-ï¿½out in London and to be an artist to be elegant and also to be in rags.<br><br>Some of these exuberant and contradictory desires are actually fulfilled as Edna helps Ram and his friend Font travel to England&#x2014;&#x201c;Jesus, Font; here we are, London and everything&#x201d;&#x2014;and Ram turns out to have a better time of it than most other people from the colonies. As an exotic, he finds himself quickly adopted by a left-ï¿½leaning English family in Hampstead. His superior class and education and fair skin help him transcend the racism that most other colonials are subjected to. So he can pity rather than despise the uneducated former soldier in Kilburn who calls Egyptians &#x201c;wogs,&#x201d; and even find it &#x201c;natural&#x201d; to sleep with the Englishman&#x2019;s fiancï¿½e. He has the upper hand on the condescending white woman who tries to pigeonhole him as one of the &#x201c;intelligent Egyptians&nbsp;. . . at the Gezira Sporting Club.&#x201d; Worried that he is turning into a &#x201c;phoney&#x201d; like his shiftless compatriots, &#x201c;the Cairo arties, who if not slumming in Europe, are driving their Jaguars in Zamalek,&#x201d; he imagines being &#x201c;down-ï¿½and-ï¿½out&#x201d; in the East End before deciding against the idea. He ends up with a compromise in Battersea, living with a working-ï¿½class man and his Irish stepfather. <br><br>Ghali recounts these adventures in Englishness with bittersweet comedy: the lonely London bedsits we know from the novels of Patrick Hamilton and Muriel Spark are suffused here with the hopefulness and energy of the deracinated colonial, who has been made to wait too long for life to begin elsewhere. To a man like Ram, conditioned by his provincial background and education to revere the metropolis, London represents all the unalloyed and thrilling glamour of metropolitan modernity; indeed, England on the whole turns out to embody the coherent world of Europe, where, unlike in Egypt, words hadn&#x2019;t drifted free from their meanings: &#x201c;where miners were communists and policemen fascists; where there was something called the &#x2018;bourgeoisie&#x2019; and someone called the &#x2018;landlady.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>But the West, so seductive with its ever-ï¿½renewed promise of pleasure and stability, remains a source of ambivalence to Ram. When in 1956 Britain tries, in a fit of neo-ï¿½imperialist delirium, to militarily seize control over the Suez Canal, Ram is further radicalized. <br><br>In spite of all the books we had read demonstrating the slyness and cruelty of England&#x2019;s foreign policy, it took the Suez war to make us believe it. Of course the Africans and the Asians had had their Suezes a long time before us&nbsp;. . . over and over again.<br><br>Ram joins the Communist Party. But he can&#x2019;t avoid the suspicion that he is not a political animal. He wonders to Edna if he is just someone who likes to &#x201c;gamble and drink and make love.&#x201d; Constantly remaking himself to suit other&#x2019;s people expectations in London, he also comes to feel an inner incoherence&#x2014;ï¿½the distinctive &#x201c;panic,&#x201d; as the dandyish narrator of Naipaul&#x2019;s The Mimic Men precisely defines it, &#x201c;of ceasing to feel myself as a whole person&#x201d; and of failing to &#x201c;fashion order out of all these unrelated adventures and encounters, myself never the same, never even the thread on which these things were hung.&#x201d; Ram is appalled to discover that he is developing a split: between the external doer and the inner observer, &#x201c;the one participating and the other watching and judging.&#x201d; More disturbing, he finds that &#x201c;there is a touch of gimmick in whatever I do.&#x201d; Even his professions of love for Edna are haunted by an oppressive sense of dï¿½jï¿½ vu: &#x201c;a scene probably already encountered in a film or a play.&#x201d; He can&#x2019;t get rid of the feeling that &#x201c;I have lost my natural self. I have become a character in a book.&#x201d; <br><br>This loss of spontaneous feeling would seem less consequential&#x2014;ï¿½a personal flaw at most&#x2014;ï¿½if it didn&#x2019;t also preclude original thinking in a postcolonial society still ruled by nostrums imported from abroad. &#x201c;The revolt of the Third World,&#x201d; Octavio Paz once warned, &#x201c;has degenerated into different varieties of frenzied Caesarism or languishes beneath the stranglehold of bureaucracies that are both cynical and fuzzy-ï¿½minded.&#x201d; New nation-ï¿½states had become prone to despotism largely because the revolt against the West had &#x201c;not discovered its proper form&#x201d;&#x2014;ï¿½ideas and institutions suited to indigenous realities. Its political and intellectual leaders suffered from a &#x201c; &#x2018;split personality,&#x2019; or in moral terms, &#x2018;inauthenticity.&#x2019; &#x201d; They invoked &#x201c;modern ideas&#x201d;&#x2014;ï¿½revolution, freedom, democracy, socialism, industrialization, mass literacy&#x2014;ï¿½but &#x201c;these ideas in many cases have been mere superficial borrowings: they have not been instruments of liberation but masks. Like all masks, their function is to shield us from the gaze of others, and, by a circular process that has often been described, to shield us from our own gaze.&#x201d; <br><br>Ram is aware that he must find a life for himself; but, sunk in the taint of colonial fantasy, and obscured by the masks of modern ideas, this basic task of self-ï¿½definition is harder for him than for the Egyptian people he seeks to represent. Yes, he has joined the Communist Party, but, as he admits, only because he can&#x2019;t do anything else with his knowledge of suffering and injustice. Returning to Egypt, where the parasites, it turns out, &#x201c;hadn&#x2019;t been dealt a heavy blow by the revolution,&#x201d; the fellaheen remain exposed to exploitation, communists have been imprisoned, and Edna has become victim to the bigotry that would soon rid Cairo of most of its Jewish, Greek, and Armenian population, Ram and Font drift into another kind of playacting: this time, as superfluous intellectuals. <br><br>Font finds a job &#x201c;brushing the snooker tables with the Literary Supplement.&#x201d; Ram tries his hand at human-rights activism. But no newspaper wants to publish his evidence of torture in Egyptian prisons. Furthermore, Ram has &#x201c;the terrible feeling that some of the pictures wouldn&#x2019;t be so gory if we didn&#x2019;t pay for them.&#x201d; His most sincere act seems to be drinking homemade &#x201c;Bass&#x201d;&#x2014;ï¿½a cocktail of the Egyptian beer Stella, vodka, and whisky&#x2014;ï¿½in a snooker club, or trying to ï¿½pater le bourgeois by pushing Mounir, the slick America-ï¿½phile, into the swimming pool of the Gezira Sporting Club. Even the anti-ï¿½Americanism is now a brittle affair, undermined by the irrecoverable colonial&#x2019;s self-ï¿½pity: &#x201c;We&#x2019;re so English it is nauseating.

However psychologically damaged and denuded of genuine emotion, Ram achieves a tragic intensity in his feelings for Edna: &#x201c;I saw her bullied by nationalities and races and political events and revolutions and dictatorships and particularly by her own vague idealism. I held her tenderly in my arms and also saw my own shallowness and unworthiness in contrast to her deepness and sincerity.&#x201d;<br><br>But Ram is also aware that he is &#x201c;never really natural&#x201d; with Edna, and she knows he won&#x2019;t be happy with her.

Chesterton famously replied simply, I am. People who reflect on life's problems find many of them of to be of their own making. We want to be happy and yet we often seem to be the source of our own unhappiness--as well as that of others. Even when that is not the case, our lives, as blessed as they may be, have their share of disappointments, shocks, and disillusionments. How do we respond? Do we become cynical and try at all costs to get as much pleasure as we can? Or do we recognize we were made for more?</p><p>In this classic work, Fulton Sheen explains the secret of authentic happiness: being spiritually remade. A genuinely spiritual life, Sheen contends, consists in more than obeying a set of commands, submitting to certain laws, reading the Bible, or even following the example of Jesus. Before all else, it consists in being re-created and incorporated into a new, higher kind of life--the supernatural life of grace--and brought into a new kind of spiritual relationship--as a child of God through Jesus Christ.</p><p>What does it mean to be a Christian? Christianity is not a system of ethics; it is a life. It is not good advice; it is Divine adoption. Being a Christian does not consist in being kind to the poor, going to Church, reading the Bible, singing hymns, being generous to relief agencies ... serving on Church committees, though it includes all of these. It is first and foremost a <i>love relationship</i>.</p></p><p><b>Archbishop Fulton Sheen</b> was one of the most celebrated churchmen of the 20th century.

Yet more than a century of archaeological research shows that the wild landscape has a long history of human presence. In fact, Native American people have hunted bison and bighorn sheep, fished for cutthroat trout, and gathered bitterroot and camas bulbs here for at least 11,000 years, and twenty-six tribes claim cultural association with Yellowstone today.<br><br>In <i>Before Yellowstone</i>, Douglas MacDonald tells the story of these early people as revealed by archaeological research into nearly 2,000 sites&#x2015;many of which he helped survey and excavate. He describes and explains the significance of archaeological areas such as the easy-to-visit Obsidian Cliff, where hunters obtained volcanic rock to make tools and for trade, and Yellowstone Lake, a traditional place for gathering edible plants. MacDonald helps readers understand the archaeological methods used and the limits of archaeological knowledge.

There is a difference! Beginning with some of the everyday scenes in the gospels and then examining some of the parables, Jerram Barrs shows us that Jesus had no wooden formula which he followed, but rather was about engaging people in the depths of their being. As a result, this is an unusually wise guide to doing evangelism.

In this work, he invites us to follow Jesus' example in seeking the lost, as he himself has done over the course of his life since Jesus found him as a despairing university student. The fruit of those years of evangelistic experience comes to expression here for our benefit as he traces Jesus' interaction in the Gospels with various individuals and groups, as he goes about his business of seeking and saving the lost. Each retelling brims with exegetical insight and existential grasp of what's going on at the time, followed by a section on 'learning from Jesus' that is full of practical wisdom, encouragement, and contemporary challenge.

Writing pleasantly and calmly and organizing their material admirably, they advise dealing with caregiver burnout by forming an "alternate family" and spreading the responsibilities and strain of providing care to the stricken among them. They include sample forms, checklists, and scripted passages for use in forming such support groups. Theirs is a highly structured approach that in times of crisis may prove invaluable. Although aimed at use by organized groups, it may also be of great value to individuals in need of a plan of action or background information.

But when people think about economics, they tend to place importance on the bigger picture - macroeconomics - including issues such as unemployment, inflation, and the competitiveness of nations. <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Avinash Dixit argues that the microeconomy has a large impact on the economic world, arguably as much as the issues of macroeconomics. <br><br>Dixit steers a clear path through the huge number of issues related to microeconomics, explaining what happens when things go well, as well as showing how they fail, why that happens, and what can be done about it. Using real-life examples from around the world, using a minimum of mathematics and including simple graphs, he provides insights into economics from psychology and sociology to explain economic behavior and rational choice.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong><br>Oxford's <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative--yet always balanced and complete--discussions of the central issues in a given discipline or field. Every<strong> Very Short Introduction </strong>gives a readable evolution of the subject in question, demonstrating how the subject has developed and how it has influenced society. Eventually, the series will encompass every major academic discipline, offering all students an accessible and abundant reference library. Whatever the area of study that one deems important or appealing, whatever the topic that fascinates the general reader, the <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> series has a handy and affordable guide that will likely prove indispensable.<br></p><p><br><strong>Avinash Dixit </strong>is Professor of Economics Emeritus at Princeton University.

Anthropologist Mary L. Gray and computer scientist Siddharth Suri team up to unveil how services delivered by companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Uber can only function smoothly thanks to the judgment and experience of a vast, invisible human labor force. These people doing "ghost work" make the internet seem smart. They perform high-tech piecework: flagging X-rated content, proofreading, designing engine parts, and much more. An estimated 8 percent of Americans have worked at least once in this &#x201c;ghost economy,&#x201d; and that number is growing. They usually earn less than legal minimums for traditional work, they have no health benefits, and they can be fired at any time for any reason, or none.<br><br> There are no labor laws to govern this kind of work, and these latter-day assembly lines draw in&#x2014;and all too often overwork and underpay&#x2014;a surprisingly diverse range of workers: harried young mothers, professionals forced into early retirement, recent grads who can&#x2019;t get a toehold on the traditional employment ladder, and minorities shut out of the jobs they want. Gray and Suri also show how ghost workers, employers, and society at large can ensure that this new kind of work creates opportunity&#x2014;rather than misery&#x2014;for those who do it.</p><p><p>MARY L. GRAY is a senior researcher at Microsoft Research New England and a fellow at Harvard University&#x2019;s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. She is also on the faculty at the School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering with affiliations in the Media School, Anthropology, and Gender Studies at Indiana University.</p> <p>SIDDHARTH SURI is a senior researcher at Microsoft Research AI and was a founding member of Microsoft Research New York City.

The boy carefully put the shotgun he had been cleaning aside and came from the kitchen.</p><p>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d; he replied.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m startin&#x2019; to worry about your pa,&#x201d; Leona said. &#x201c;Him and Henry are usually through with their drinkin&#x2019; and card playin&#x2019; by now. I want you to go down to Virginia City and tell them I&#x2019;m gonna throw their supper out the door if they don&#x2019;t get theirselves home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes&#x2019;um,&#x201d; the stoic young boy replied.</p><p>With no sign of emotion, he turned and went to the front corner of the cabin, where he slept on a bedroll, and picked up his hat. It was not the first time he had been sent to find his father and his hard-drinking friend, and it was a chore that he didn&#x2019;t much care for. It would be a year this month since they had come to the gulch in search of gold. And so far, it seemed the main thing his father had accomplished was to garner a reputation for himself as a drunk and a brawler.</p><p>There wasn&#x2019;t much law enforcement in most parts of Alder Gulch. Outlaws and hell-raisers were ultimately dealt with by the vigilance committee, and Jace felt sure they were keeping an eye on Weed and his father. He was disappointed that his father lacked the backbone to resist the temptations of the lawless crowd. The family had fled Kansas after his father and Weed were identified by witnesses as the men involved in a bank holdup. That holdup had been Weed&#x2019;s idea, and he had talked Jace&#x2019;s father into it. It seemed as though every scrape his father found himself in could be traced back to some illegal scheme that Henry Weed had come up with. Mostly Jace was ashamed for his mother, and the abuse she sometimes suffered when his drunken father came home after a night of gambling and dallying with the <i>fancy ladies</i> at the saloon.</p><p>On this day, the rain had started in the morning and his father had said it was too wet to work their claim. But he and Weed decided it was not too wet to ride over to Alder Gulch for a drink of whiskey and maybe a hand or two of poker. When Jace had asked how the rain could hurt the gold they were looking for in the water, he received a backhand for his sarcasm. And then off they went, riding to Alder Gulch in the rain after a casual promise to be back by suppertime.</p><p>With his hat pulled low to help shield him from the rain, Jace plodded along the trail that led to Virginia City. His coat was soon soaked through, but he ignored the discomfort, concentrating more on what he would say to convince his father to come home.</p><p>When he reached the point where the trail ended at the main street that traced the length of Alder Gulch, he was immediately aware of an event going on beside the Miners Saloon. A sizable crowd had gathered to stand in the rain, ignoring the occasional flash of lightning and rumble of thunder. And when he came closer, he realized they were there to witness a hanging. As curious as anyone, he edged up through the noisy circle of spectators to see for himself. There was no tree next to the saloon, but it was not the first hanging that had taken place there. One single pole served as a gallows. Approximately fifteen feet tall, the pole had been notched near the top so that a rope could be tied and secured to support the unfortunate victim as he dangled at the noose end of the rope. With his hands tied behind his back and his feet bound together, the victim hung motionless, his head cocked to the side by the heavy noose around his neck. In the darkness, it was hard to see the man&#x2019;s face, but from the excited conversation he overheard around him, he learned that the man had been hanged because he killed a fellow he had argued with in the saloon.</p><p>Since he didn&#x2019;t see him in the crowd of spectators, Jace decided he&#x2019;d best look for his father instead of gawking at a dead man. So he had started to turn away and head for the saloon when he was startled by a sudden bright flash, followed almost immediately by a loud clap of thunder. In those few seconds, he was stunned to see the grotesque features of his father&#x2019;s face, in the flash of lightning.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the good Lord saying thank you for riddin&#x2019; this world of troublemakers like John Engels,&#x201d; he heard someone say. It was followed by a hardy chuckle from someone else.</p><p>Jace felt his body go numb, and his legs threatened to deny him support as he pushed blindly through the crowd of men standing around the pole. Confused and horrified by the terrible scene he had just witnessed, he didn&#x2019;t know what to do. After making his way through the mob, he leaned against the wall of the saloon until he could think clearly once again. His father was dead, and that was the only thing he knew for sure.</p><p><i>Weed,</i> he thought then. <i>Where is Henry Weed?</i></p><p>He decided he should find him, so he left the side of the building and started searching through the crowd again. But Weed was nowhere to be found, so he went inside the saloon to look for him there, but to no avail. He was left with no choice but to return home as fast as he could to take the terrible news to his mother.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Running almost all of the two miles back to the camp, Jace was surprised to find Weed&#x2019;s and his father&#x2019;s horse standing beside the cabin. Weed had evidently started for home shortly before the boy arrived at the scene of the hanging, and had somehow circled back on the trail Jace had walked. Perhaps Jace would have seen him if he had not been walking with his head down in the driving rain.</p><p><i>So Ma already knows about Pa,</i> he thought as he opened the door.</p><p>He walked into the cabin to find his mother sobbing in Henry Weed&#x2019;s arms. When she heard Jace come in, she turned and beckoned to him. He went at once to comfort her. She put her arm around him and pulled him close to Weed and herself.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Jace,&#x201d; she wailed. &#x201c;Did you see your pa?&#x201d; When he answered yes, she sobbed again. &#x201c;You poor boy,&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry you had to see him like that, hung on a post.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There warn&#x2019;t nothin&#x2019; I could do to help him,&#x201d; Henry Weed said. &#x201c;He got into a tussle with some feller we was playin&#x2019; cards with, and before I knowed it, they was goin&#x2019; at each other with their guns. John was faster&#x2019;n that feller, and shot him through the chest before he ever cleared the table with his six-shooter. Then a bunch of fellers that had been standin&#x2019; at the bar, drinkin&#x2019;, took your pa down before he could get off another shot. They said they was on the vigilance committee, and they was fixin&#x2019; to put a stop to all the lawlessness in town. I got back here as fast as I could. You don&#x2019;t have to worry, I&#x2019;m gonna take care of your ma.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I reckon I can take care of my ma,&#x201d; Jace said.</p><p>&#x201c;Why, sure you can,&#x201d; Weed said, &#x201c;but I expect I&#x2019;d best be the one to take care of both of you.&#x201d;</p><p>Leona stopped crying then. &#x201c;Henry&#x2019;s right, Jace. He&#x2019;s offered to stay with us and take care of us now that your pa&#x2019;s gone. We&#x2019;ll talk some more about it later on tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about Pa?&#x201d; Jace wanted to know. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to go get him down from that pole and bury him proper.&#x201d; He looked at Weed, waiting for his answer.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if we can do that,&#x201d; Leona said.</p><p>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Jace asked.</p><p>Weed answered for her. &#x201c;They ain&#x2019;t likely to let us take John down from there for a while yet. They&#x2019;ll most likely want him to hang there to let other folks know what happens to troublemakers in Virginia City.&#x201d;</p><p>Jace couldn&#x2019;t believe the indifference on the part of his father&#x2019;s wife and his supposed best friend. &#x201c;How can you just not care what happens to Pa&#x2019;s body?&#x201d; he charged. He turned to look into his mother&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to take care of Pa.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Leona said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s best to just do what we can to carry on now without him. I knew it was gonna come to this. It was just a matter of time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The hell we will!&#x201d; Jace exclaimed.</p><p>&#x201c;Now, don&#x2019;t be gettin&#x2019; yourself riled up about this,&#x201d; Weed said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s over and done with. Your pa&#x2019;s gone, and I reckon it was bound to happen&#x2014;the way things were goin&#x2019; and all.&#x201d;</p><p>Jace made no response other than the angry glare he cast in Weed&#x2019;s direction. His pa wouldn&#x2019;t be dead if he had never crossed paths with Henry Weed. After a moment, Jace shifted an accusing gaze at his mother, who was no longer crying, but stood wringing her hands in apparent distress. It infuriated the boy that Henry Weed was acting as if John Engels was the wild, hard-drinking troublemaker, and he was no more than an innocent bystander.</p><p><i>Some friend,</i> he thought, glaring at Weed again.</p><p>He made up his mind then that he was going to cut his father down from that pole, no matter what his mother or Weed said. He had never had a particularly close relationship with his father, but he was his father, and he didn&#x2019;t intend to leave him hanging as an amusement for the miners in Virginia City.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put the horses away,&#x201d; he volunteered, and headed for the door.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good idea,&#x201d; Weed said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;re some things I wanna talk to your mama about while you&#x2019;re doin&#x2019; that.&#x201d;</p><p>Outside the cabin, Jace paused to study the nighttime sky. The rain had slackened considerably as the thunderstorm moved across the gulch, though the clouds were as dark and thick as before. He led the two horses behind the cabin to the simple shelter that served as a stable for them and the two mules. Having already decided what he was going to do, he left the saddles on the horses, then tied a shovel to the saddle on Weed&#x2019;s horse. Next, he checked the Henry rifle riding in the sling on his father&#x2019;s saddle to make sure it was still there and had not suffered any from the rain. Satisfied that Weed would not likely take the trouble to check on the horses, he returned to the cabin.</p><p>When he walked in the door, he found the two of them standing before the fireplace, facing the door as if waiting for him. &#x201c;We need to tell you somethin&#x2019;,&#x201d; Weed said. &#x201c;We decided that the way things are, the best thing is for me and your mama to live together as man and wife.&#x201d;</p><p>Jace recoiled sharply. Seeing his reaction, his mother tried to soften the shock. &#x201c;Henry has been kind enough to offer to take care of us, now that your father&#x2019;s gone. I know it&#x2019;s kind of sudden, but I think John would approve of it. He and Henry were such close friends.&#x201d;</p><p>Unable to speak for a moment while his brain spun wildly, Jace finally blurted, &#x201c;Pa ain&#x2019;t even in the ground yet! It didn&#x2019;t take you long to jump into the bed together!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jace!&#x201d; Leona scolded. &#x201c;You watch your mouth! It ain&#x2019;t like that at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your mama&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Weed said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just the best thing to do. I&#x2019;ve always had a fondness for your mama, and I intend to make it right when we can stand up before a preacher. We&#x2019;ll make a new start. Me and John had been talkin&#x2019; about movin&#x2019; on anyway. We ain&#x2019;t found much of anythin&#x2019; in the sluice box for a while now, so I think it&#x2019;s best to leave our claim and head up to Helena. There&#x2019;s a new strike at Last Chance Gulch and we can make a fresh start there&#x2014;might have a little better luck. There ain&#x2019;t no reason me and you can&#x2019;t get along, as long as you mind your ma and me. Whaddaya say?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds to me like it don&#x2019;t make no difference what I think,&#x201d; Jace replied. &#x201c;You and Ma have already decided what you&#x2019;re gonna do.&#x201d;</p><p>Tired of trying to solicit the boy&#x2019;s cooperation, Weed smirked and said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s about the size of it, boy, so you might as well get used to it.&#x201d;</p><p>Anxious to avoid a conflict between Weed and her son, Leona spoke up then. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s sit down and eat the supper getting cold on the table. No matter what&#x2019;s happened, we need to eat.&#x201d;</p><p>Jace still found it hard to believe his mother&#x2019;s apparent acceptance of his father&#x2019;s death and her immediate acceptance of Weed&#x2019;s proposal&#x2014;not much different from changing one horse to ride another when the first one gets tired. But he said nothing more. He sat down at the table with them and ate the supper she had cooked. When he was finished, he excused himself to make a final check on the livestock before going to his bedroll in the front corner of the cabin. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll start a new day in the morning,&#x201d; his mother said to him as he pulled the quilt that served as his bedroom wall across his little corner.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; he mumbled.</p><p>He lay there on the thin pallet for what seemed hours, listening to the whispered conversation between his mother and Henry Weed. Finally the talking stopped. Even then he continued to lie there until he felt certain they were both asleep. As quietly as he could, he pulled the edge of the quilt back far enough to peek into the main room. Weed was sprawled on the pallet he had been using before, snoring lustily, the alcohol he had apparently consumed earlier finally rendering him unconscious. Jace slipped outside the quilt and paused to watch the sleeping man. There was no sound from the bedroom.</p><p><i>At least he ain&#x2019;t already jumped in bed with my mother,</i> he thought, and tiptoed to the door.</p><p>Outside, he went quickly to the stable and led the horses out, walking them up the path until certain he was away from the cabin without anyone aware of his departure. Stepping up into the saddle then, he headed back to Virginia City, his father&#x2019;s cartridge belt around his waist, and his Henry rifle riding in the saddle sling.</p><p>The storm had spent its energy and moved on, leaving a dark and damp night. He had no watch to tell the time, but he knew the hour was late when he reached the ridge overlooking the gulch and the lusty town that never slept.</p><p>Nudging his father&#x2019;s sorrel gelding, he descended to the noisy street below, riding along unnoticed by the drunks coming and going from the saloons. He pulled the horses up when he got to the harness shop next to the Miners Saloon, thinking he was prepared to see the grisly sight of his father&#x2019;s lifeless body dangling from the solitary pole again. ...</p></p><h2>Tales of a Magic Monastery</h2><p>Here, the charming, mature stories from the internationallly beloved monk&nbsp;are accompanied by&nbsp;original art.

And yet it is one of the richest, most memorable experiences an athlete will ever know.</p><p>Some call it a natural high. Others refer to it as being in a zone. Whatever it's called, flow is an elusive and very sought-after psychological state that athletes, coaches, and sport psychologists have tried to understand, harness, and employ to their benefit since Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi first coined the term back in the early 1970s. </p><p>Now, in the first book devoted exclusively to flow in sports, the pioneering legend Csikszentmihalyi and sport psychology researcher Susan Jackson attempt not only to explain the phenomenon but also to identify the key conditions associated with its occurrence.</p><p>The book begins with a description of what flow is and is not. Flow is defined as a person's total absorption into an activity. While it is always a peak, satisfying experience, it is not necessarily associated with peak performance on every occasion. </p><p>Most of the book delves deeply into the key factors leading up to and accompanying the flow experience. The authors also recommend certain actions on the part of the athlete or coach to optimize the conditions in training and performance that allow flow to occur. The book is full of vivid examples, captivating quotes, and revealing research findings that enhance the authors' clear and insightful text. </p><p>The sport setting is rife with opportunities to experience flow-be it in pick-up games or the Olympics. But until now, flow has been an infrequent, accidental, and even mysterious phenomenon to most athletes. With <i>Flow in Sports</i>, this optimal experience becomes both more familiar and more achievable. Get to know flow, and get into it. Find out what you've been missing. </p><p></p></p><p><p><br><b>Susan Jackson</b> and <b>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</b> combine their backgrounds to present the most authoritative work on the phenomenon of flow in sports, bringing together the expertise of the world's leading authority on flow with the leading researcher on the subject. </p><p>Susan Jackson, PhD, won two awards for her ground-breaking doctoral dissertation, titled <i>Elite Athletes in Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Sport Experience.</i> Jackson has continued to conduct research and publish articles on flow in sports, and is known internationally for her work on the subject.</p><p>She brings to her work the perspectives of athlete, coach, teacher, sport psychology consultant, and university lecturer. Jackson lives in Brisbane, Australia, and lectures in the School of Human Movement Studies at Queensland University of Technology. </p><p>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, PhD, developed the concept of flow in the mid-1970s and has pioneered research on the subject in work, social, and educational settings ever since. His early research on flow explored play and happiness and involved a number of prominent athletes. He has published 10 books, among them the ground-breaking <i>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</i>, as well as <i>Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention</i> and <i>Finding Flow: The Psychology of Engagement With Everyday Life</i>. </p><p>Csikszentmihalyi is an elected fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1997) and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1998).

Drawing on years of research in a wide range of sources, Thompson brings to life the lives of Washington&#x2019;s slaves while illuminating the radical change in his views on slavery and race wrought by the American Revolution.</p><p>Thompson begins with an examination of George and Martha Washington as slave owners. Culling from letters to financial ledgers, travel diaries kept by visitors and reminiscences of family members as well as of former slaves and neighbors, Thompson explores various facets of everyday life on the plantation ranging from work to domestic life, housing, foodways, private enterprise, and resistance. Along the way, she considers the relationship between Washington&#x2019;s military career and his style of plantation management and relates the many ways slaves rebelled against their condition. The book closes with Washington&#x2019;s attempts to reconcile being a slave owner with the changes in his thinking on slavery and race, ending in his decision to grant his slaves freedom in his will.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Mary V.

After exploring the lives of hundreds of President Washington&#x2019;s unpaid black workers, you may rightly ask, "Why didn&#x2019;t I know about all this before?" Read. Rethink. Discuss with a friend.</p> (Peter H. Wood, Duke University, author of <i>Strange New Land: Africans in Colonial America</i>)<br><br><p>Thompson, a research historian at George Washington's Mount Vernon, offers a superb study of slavery there from Washington&#x2019;s first cultivation of the estate in 1754 to his death in 1799. Through meticulous research gathered over 30 years, Thompson glimpses Washington and slavery in contextualized, fine-grained discussions, primarily drawn from concerns articulated by Washington in his copious correspondence.... Summing Up: Highly recommended.</p> (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br><p>Thompson focuses on various aspects of slave life with each chapter of <i>The Only Unavoidable Subject of Regret.</i> The reader gets a thorough understanding of how Mount Vernon operated as a business community. There are valuable and interesting facts about how the slaves ate, worshipped, dressed, and spent their infrequent recreational time. Other topics include crime and punishment, the slave economy, diseases, housing, and how the slaves resisted their condition.... The extensive research is evident throughout the book.

Aster is fascinated by the spells that the girls are learning, so he spies on their lessons whenever he can. When several boys disappear during shapeshifting practice, Aster realizes that he can help save them using witchcraft to battle a strange and powerful enemy&#x2014;but he'll have to break his family's traditions and risk his life. Both the plot and the overall message are straightforward and familiar but engaging. Beneath the fantastical elements lies a story about upending gender expectations, forging identity, and uncovering heroic potential in oneself. Those who enjoy sci-fi or fantasy stories about protagonists who must prove that their society's rules are flawed will appreciate this offering. Ostertag's bright, gentle, cartoonlike artwork brims with life and adds extra appeal to this fast-moving story.

I take issue with that, being a quadriplegic who has battled cancer and struggles daily with pain. I love my Savior, am passionate about His Gospel, and enjoy the ministry He has given me. But that does not exclude me from occasionally stumbling into the miry pit of dark emotions. I enthusiastically endorse this book and recommend it to pastors, families, leaders, and Christian counselors!&#34; - Joni Eareckson Tada, director of Joni and Friends International Disability Center, author, and speaker In this achingly honest work, Dr. Somerville explains that depression is not restricted to the secular world. Throughout history, godly men and woman-among them Martin Luther and Charles Spurgeon-have suffered in the deep trenches of dark emotion. But God&#39;s Word promises victory at the seemingly unreachable end of trials, and new strength forged from adversity and pain in the new light that follows the darkness of despair. You are not alone. In If I&#39;m a Christian, Why am I Depressed? you will find not only the author&#39;s testimony but also those of others who have struggled with depression and through prayer and biblical counseling have overcome by embracing Christ&#39;s healing love.

He's a Luddite addicted to his iPhone, a dentist with a nicotine habit, a rabid Red Sox fan devastated by their victories, and an atheist not quite willing to let go of God. <br><br>Then someone begins to impersonate Paul online, and he watches in horror as a website, a Facebook page, and a Twitter account are created in his name. What begins as an outrageous violation of his privacy soon becomes something more soul-frightening: the possibility that the online "Paul" might be a better version of the real thing. As Paul's quest to learn why his identity has been stolen deepens, he is forced to confront his troubled past and his uncertain future in a life disturbingly split between the real and the virtual. <br><br>At once laugh-out-loud funny about the absurdities of the modern world, and indelibly profound about the eternal questions of the meaning of life, love and truth, TO RISE AGAIN AT A DECENT HOUR is a deeply moving and constantly surprising tour de force.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2014:</strong> Paul O'Rourke defines himself as three things: a dentist, a die-hard Red Sox fan, and an atheist.

They bring alive her family and friends, her surroundings and contemporary events, all with a freshness unparalleled in modern biographies. Most important, we recognize the unmistakable voice of the author of such novels as <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> and <em>Emma</em>. We see the shift in her writing from witty and amusing descriptions of the social life of town and country, to a thoughtful and constructive tone while writing about the business of literary composition. <br><br>R.W.

This new fourth edition incorporates the findings of recent scholarship to further enrich our understanding of Austen and give us the fullest and most revealing view yet of her life and family. In addition, Le Faye has written a new preface, has amended and updated the biographical and topographical indexes, has introduced a new subject index, and had added the contents of the notes to the general index. <br><br>Teachers, students, and fans of Jane Austen, at all levels, will find in these letters remarkable insight into one of the most popular novelists ever.<br></p><p><br><strong>Deirdre Le Faye</strong>, now retired, worked for many years in the Department of Medieval &amp; Later Antiquities at the British Museum.

This book presents new English translations of Chiri's remarkable work. </p> <p>Originally written in <i>yukar</i> form, a type of chant used by female storytellers among the Ainu villages of Hokkaido, these stories tell of the relationship between mankind and the world of spirits. Each <i>yukar</i> is narrated by a spirit -- fox, whale, frog, or even shellfish. Most important is the owl god, Kotankor Kamui, whose two long songs describe the covenant between humans and the spirits who provide them with food. Other tales focus on the balance of nature, on the respect due between animal spirits and people, and on the strength of Okikirmui, the human hero. </p> <p>The Ainu oral tradition was in danger of dying in the early 20th century, when the teenaged Chiri Yukie resolved to begin writing down these chants. Descended from a line of female storytellers, she devised a way of representing Ainu language in the Roman alphabet, and made Japanese translations of the most important tales. </p> <p>Although she died at 19, the thirteen tales she had written down went on to become a sensation. Her clear and beautiful yet intricate and emotive Japanese translations brought Ainu culture to a wide audience in Japan and created a movement to record and preserve Ainu belief in a living state. In many ways, the idea of trying to learn from and preserve tribal wisdom goes back to Chiri's book. </p> <p>Chiri's work includes the best-known passages of Ainu literature: Chiri's original introduction, an elegy to the vanishing Ainu way of life, and the tale 'Silver drops fall around, golden drops fall around'. </p> <p>This translation tries to preserve the rich texture of Chiri's versions in English, while remaining absolutely true to the details of the original. A clear introduction to Chiri, her book, and its language is provided, giving the reader a vivid insight into this startlingly sophisticated spiritual tradition. </p></p><p></p><h2>Teaching with Authority: How to Cut Through Doctrinal Confusion &amp; Understand What the Church Really Says</h2><p>Teaching with Authority is a unique, valuable, and long-overdue resource for all Catholics as well as those inquiring about the Faith. It will help deepen your understanding of what the Church teaches by showing you (maybe for the first time) how and why and where it does. Not another catechism or Catholicism for beginners book, Teaching with Authority isn t about understanding specific teachings of the Faith (even the complicated and misunderstood ones) but rather about understanding Catholic teaching itself. Where does the Church s teaching authority come from? How do we weigh dogmas versus practices, doctrines versus disciplines, conciliar declarations versus papal interviews? How do we sort through the many kinds of ecclesial documents and determine their relative authority and relevance? And, in an age when accusations of heresy fly regularly across social media, with competing sides eager to paint the other as unfaithful to Catholic tradition or to the current pope, Jimmy also tackles the issues of incredulity, apostasy, and schism showing you how to recognize different forms of dissent and respond to them fittingly.</p><p>Jimmy Akin was born in Texas and grew up nominally Protestant. At age 20 he experienced a profound conversion to Christ. Planning on becoming a Protestant pastor or seminary professor, Jimmy started an intensive study of the Bible, but the more he immersed himself in Scripture, the more he found it to support the Catholic faith. Eventually, he was compelled in conscience to enter the Catholic Church, which he did in 1992. His conversion story,A Triumph and a Tragedy,is published in the book Surprised By Truth. Akin is a Senior Apologist at Catholic Answers, a member on the Catholic Answers Speakers Bureau, a weekly guest on the global radio program, Catholic Answers Live, a contributing editor for Catholic Answers Magazine, and the author of numerous books including The Salvation Controversy, The Fathers Know Best,The Drama of Salvation, and A Daily Defense.

It is known as the <i>Diamond Sutra </i> because its teachings are said to be like diamonds that cut away all dualistic thought, releasing one from the attachment to objects and bringing one to the further shore of enlightenment. The format of this important sutra is presented as a conversation between the Buddha and one of his disciples. <i>The Sutra of Hui-neng</i>, also known as the <i>Platform Sutra</i>, contains the autobiography of a pivotal figure in Zen history and some of the most profound passages of Zen literature. Hui-neng (638&#x2013;713) was the sixth patriarch of Zen in China, but is often regarded as the true father of the Zen tradition. He was a poor, illiterate woodcutter who is said to have attained enlightenment upon hearing a recitation of the <i>Diamond Sutra</i>. Together, these two scriptures present the central teaching of the Zen Buddhist tradition and are essential reading for all students of Buddhism. <br><br></p><p><b>Wong Mou-lam</b>&nbsp;(1886&#x2013;1934) was from Guangdong, China.

After a manic spree around Manhattan, Zack, who is bipolar, was arrested on a subway platform and admitted to Bellevue Hospital. <br><br>So begins the story of Zack's freefall into psychosis and his desperate, poignant, often hilarious struggle to claw his way back to sanity.

Never reveal the secrets you find behind locked doors, and never&#x2014;ever!&#x2014;abuse the power to open a lock.&#x201d;</p><p>Genevieve pondered this morsel of advice while Jason, her soon-to-be-ex-husband, spoke.</p><p>Uncle Dave had been on her mind a lot lately. For one thing, she kept dreaming about kneeling before a locked door, hearing his ever-patient voice in her ear as she tried repeatedly (and unsuccessfully) to pick the lock. For another, her uncle&#x2019;s recent death had left her with a hollow feeling: sorrow mixed with regret.</p><p>Dave&#x2019;s passing also left his Parisian locksmith shop unattended.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never met a person as locked down as you are,&#x201d; Jason was saying as he leaned back against the stainless-steel Sub-Zero refrigerator (wide enough for party platters) that cost as much as Genevieve made in a month. His stance was belligerent&#x2014;hands on hips, gym-toned chest thrust forward&#x2014;but his liquid blue eyes conveyed contrition mixed, annoyingly, with a touch of self-conscious pity. &#x201c;How can you even <i>think</i> of moving to Paris while we&#x2019;re in the middle of this? There are papers to sign, and lawyers to meet with.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds like the perfect time to leave the country,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;you have to admit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Be reasonable, Genie.&#x201d;</p><p>She winced. Yet another reason to move to Paris: The French knew how to pronounce her name. <i>Genevieve.</i> Not Jenny or Genie or even Jen-a-<i>veev</i>, but <i>Zhohn-vee-ev</i>. Was it any wonder her marriage hadn&#x2019;t worked out? That&#x2019;s what she got for marrying a man who couldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;or wouldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;say her name properly. But he wasn&#x2019;t the only one; even her best friend, Mary, called her by her surname: Martin.</p><p>All things considered, Genevieve decided, it was her mother&#x2019;s fault. They weren&#x2019;t French, after all. Her mother had spent a few weeks visiting her brother in Paris the year before Genevieve was born; a framed photo had rested on her bureau: Angela and Dave, him smiling and goateed, her with wind-whipped hair. The two of them were bookended by gargoyles high atop the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, the city laid out in the background. But was that one trip abroad reason enough for her parents to saddle their daughter with such a hard-to-pronounce name?</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as though I planned my uncle&#x2019;s death,&#x201d; Genevieve said, consciously trying to accede to Jason&#x2019;s wishes, to be reasonable. &#x201c;Someone needs to go tend to things.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He has a daughter, doesn&#x2019;t he? Let her take care of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Catharine doesn&#x2019;t know the first thing about locks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you do, don&#x2019;t you? Sometimes I think that&#x2019;s all you care about.&#x201d;</p><p>Out of habit, she reached up to play with the rusty key that had hung on a copper chain around her neck ever since her mother&#x2019;s untimely death, when Genevieve was fourteen. To modern eyes it looked nothing at all like a key. More like a hunk of rusted metal.</p><p>Around here, often, this key put people in mind of the Oakland hills conflagration, the wildfire that ate through hundreds of splendid homes and claimed twenty-five souls. In the smoldering aftermath, heartbroken owners went back to sift through the rubble, collecting items from their former homes that they would later incorporate into shrines: twisted slabs of glass, slumped shards of metal, half-burned albums with a few miraculously intact photographs of Grandma.</p><p>And keys: some twisted and charred, others still jingling in pockets, ready to open doors that no longer existed.</p><p>Years later, having rebuilt with better, treeless views of San Francisco, homeowners displayed these fragments of their old lives in niches, or hung them by fishing line from pieces of gray driftwood. While sipping cocktails they would retell the story: the unseasonably warm day, the shifting winds, the panicked warnings to evacuate. They would speak of wrangling cats and grabbing heirlooms and locating passports; of fleeing down the snakelike turns of hillside roads, a wall of black smoke at their backs. They would think, but not say aloud, that it was unfair that their beautiful homes should have blazed in the inferno while the rest of Oakland&#x2014;much of it due for a good burning&#x2014;had remained intact.</p><p>The key Genevieve wore around her neck had nothing at all to do with the Oakland hills fire, but she let her neighbors assume it did. It was easier that way. All she had to say was &#x201c;the fire,&#x201d; and people nodded and looked away. They treated her with hushed tones, allowed her to avoid their eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Genie, are you even listening to me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell you what,&#x201d; Genevieve said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make this easy: All I want is a ticket to Paris and enough money to take over my uncle&#x2019;s locksmith shop. You can keep the rest.&#x201d;</p><p>Suspicion clouded Jason&#x2019;s beautiful eyes.</p><p>Genevieve had always thought herself smarter than her husband, her mind able to make quick logical leaps that evaded him. Still, he was much more successful than she. Jason was in software sales. He wooed his clients with truffles made from organic free-trade cocoa, hand rolled in powdered sugar by single mothers at a women&#x2019;s collective in Berkeley. Jason felt virtuous when he bought these chocolates, the clients felt good about eating them, and, fueled by sugar and caffeine, they placed software orders in record numbers. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a win-win,&#x201d; was one of Jason&#x2019;s favorite phrases, and he lived by that credo. But then, fate had been kind to him: Tall and well built, with light brown hair and blue eyes, he worked out religiously, dressed fashionably, and had a knack for remembering names. Nothing in Jason&#x2019;s experience had suggested that life was anything other than a series of mutually beneficial relationships. Win-win.</p><p>What business had someone like Genevieve, she wondered for the hundredth time, had marrying a lighthearted optimist?</p><p>A thick sludge covered the bottom of her coffee cup. A freebie from a fund-raiser luncheon, the mug was the perfect size and weight, and she relished the way the palm of her hand cradled it, telegraphing the warmth of its contents to her blood in the mornings. Because although their house was expensive, it was old and drafty and always cold, built in a stand of redwoods on a hill overlooking Oakland and the San Francisco Bay. On a clear day an astute viewer might catch a glimpse of the Golden Gate Bridge, an earthy shade of Tuscan red gleaming in the sunshine. But clear days were rare. The house was engulfed by fog most mornings and by clouds most afternoons, and the soaring trees reached up into the haze and dripped dew onto the roof, the water tap-tap-tapping in a steady cadence that Genevieve found pleasant but Jason did not.</p><p>Genevieve knew Jason would have preferred to toss her old chipped mug into the trash in favor of the creamy bisque coffee set he had bought in a tiny Italian boutique in San Francisco&#x2019;s North Beach not long after they married and moved into the house with the blue door. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s called Bianco de Bianco,&#x201d; Jason had said, showing off the ceramics to their guests as they lingered over after-dinner coffee. &#x201c;You mean &#x2018;white&#x2019;?&#x201d; Mary had asked in her signature dry tone. Genevieve had snorted; then, in penance, had remarked upon the set&#x2019;s simple, refined beauty. That was back when she had been careful to protect her husband&#x2019;s feelings, his pride. Not anymore.</p><p><i>Clearly this marriage is no longer mutually beneficial.</i> Genevieve wondered whether the woman Jason had been seeing, Quiana, found their affair a win-win.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you serious?&#x201d; Jason asked, looking at Genevieve out of the corner of his eye. &#x201c;All you want is a locksmith shop?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll take this cup, too.&#x201d;</p><p>She could almost make out the sound of wheels grinding as Jason considered her offer, searching for the catch. &#x201c;How much are we talking? What&#x2019;s a locksmith shop in Paris worth?&#x201d;</p><p><i>Priceless.</i> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure. I&#x2019;ll need to speak with my cousin Catharine and figure out the details. For the moment, I just want the plane ticket.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Genie&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Jason&#x2019;s voice dropped, becoming gentle, earnest. &#x201c;What in the world are you going to do in Paris? You&#x2019;re a copy editor, not a locksmith.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Suddenly you&#x2019;re a fan of my copyediting?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At least it&#x2019;s a real job. Locksmithing is a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a dream. A childhood memory.&#x201d;</p><p>His words sent Genevieve&#x2019;s mind tripping over the memory of all the locks she had mastered at her uncle&#x2019;s side: the double-ball padlock and dimple devices she practiced on until she was ready for Schlage&#x2019;s side pin. She could hear their soft clicks and whirs in her mind, drowning out Jason&#x2019;s words.</p><p>&#x201c;Genie&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you don&#x2019;t have to do this. We could see a marriage counselor, work things out. How many times do I have to say it? It was a mistake. I&#x2019;m <i>sorry</i>. It didn&#x2019;t mean anything; it just happened.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He trailed off, shook his handsome head. Remembered what his life coach told him about being a man and taking responsibility. &#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s not right. No excuses. I&#x2019;m so sorry I hurt you, Genie.&#x201d;</p><p>Genevieve continued searching the contents of her coffee cup without responding.</p><p>Here was the truth: <i>Deep down</i> <i>she didn&#x2019;t care.</i> She was using Jason&#x2019;s affair as a reason to demand the separation, but it was the very fact that she couldn&#x2019;t get herself to care that made her realize they should divorce. When they first met, she had been dazzled by Jason&#x2019;s straightforward, sunny disposition; now she found it stifling, exhausting. Unbearable. Jason was not a bad man. He needed something from his partner that Genevieve could not give; must he be condemned for that? And yet, publicly, she <i>did</i> place the blame on him, citing his affair, feigning heartbreak, taking the easy way out. Allowing people to make assumptions, just as they did about the key she wore around her neck.</p><p>She reached up to brush her fingers along the rusty talisman, warm from her skin.</p><p>Genevieve had found the key while cleaning out her mother&#x2019;s lingerie drawer, not long after she died. It had been swathed in Bubble Wrap, in an airmail package.</p><p>With it was a note written in a spidery, all-caps scrawl: <i>YOU HOLD THE KEY.</i></p><p>It was postmarked Paris.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>1997</p><p>The uncle she had never met picked her up at Charles de Gaulle Airport, which she learned the locals called Roissy. They drove toward Paris in the smallest car Genevieve had ever seen, past hulking blocks of cement buildings that made up dismal housing projects and industrial sites. At long last they exited the thruway and began inching through thick traffic in the streets of Paris. Ominous skies were drizzling more than raining: a sluggish, lugubrious wetting. Parisians hunched over in their coats and boots, collars turned up, wielding umbrellas like weapons on the crowded sidewalks.</p><p>Everything, from the darkening sky to the balconied buildings to the trash in the street, was some dreary shade of gray. Why did people speak of this city with such adoration? Her mother always used to refer to Paris as &#x201c;the City of Lights,&#x201d; her voice taking on a rare reverential tone when she spoke of it.</p><p>&#x201c;How was your trip?&#x201d; asked Uncle Dave as they drove.</p><p>Genevieve shrugged in response, not wanting to look at him.</p><p>Dave was an old man, Genevieve had realized with a shock when she first set eyes on her uncle in the airport. He had a full head of white hair and a Don Quixote&#x2013;style goatee, and he walked with a limp. At more than twenty years her mother&#x2019;s senior, Dave seemed more grandfather than uncle. According to family lore, a teenaged Dave had come to Paris to help rebuild after World War II, fell in love with a Frenchwoman named Pasquale, married, and never returned.</p><p>At the airport, he had stood outside of customs holding up a hand-lettered sign, black ink on bright red paper: GENEVIEVE MARTIN, WELCOME!</p><p>Her Air France escort, who had been tasked with making sure Genevieve didn&#x2019;t somehow become lost on the nonstop flight from San Francisco, was an elegant, slender blonde who filled out her uniform perfectly and called Genevieve &#x201c;sweetheart&#x201d; in English with a lilting, melodic accent. Genevieve had hated her on sight and throughout the twelve-hour journey answered her gracious condescension with sneers and eye rolls.</p><p>Upon spying Dave&#x2019;s sign the flight attendant gave Genevieve&#x2019;s uncle a frosty nod and handed her charge over to him without a word, disappearing behind doors clearly marked: Dï¿½FENSE D&#x2019;ENTRER. No admittance.</p><p>Despite her attempts to alienate the attendant throughout the flight, Genevieve felt a pang of abandonment as she watched the woman go. Glancing up at the smiling old man with the sign, Genevieve thought, <i>He could be anyone</i>. He had shown no documentation, after all. And he didn&#x2019;t look much like the old photo on her mom&#x2019;s bureau. What if he was some creepy French child molester who&#x2019;d read her name on a list somewhere and decided to pick up an &#x201c;unaccompanied minor&#x201d; to do awful things, the kinds of crimes spoken of in whispers?</p><p>Genevieve wished her brother, Nick, were here, or her dad. Uncle Dave had invited them all to come; Genevieve had overheard his boisterous voice on speakerphone, declaring that Paris could cure heartache. Her father and brother claimed they were too busy with the farm, but they booked a flight for Genevieve, whether she wanted to go or not. Probably glad to be rid of her, she thought.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you eat on the plane?&#x201d; Dave asked as they drove.</p><p>Genevieve shrugged again. Still, she was relieved he spoke English. She hadn&#x2019;t been entirely sure he would but had been too embarrassed to ask. Her mother, Angela, had told stories about her Parisian brother over the years, and Genevieve had a vague sense that he might be the reason she was saddled with a name that was so difficult to spell, but she hadn&#x2019;t really put all the pieces together. But now she realized that, like her mother, Dave had been born and raised in Mississippi. He even spoke with a slight drawl, reminding her of home. Of her mom.</p><p>Her <i>dead</i> mom.</p><p>She felt the hot prickle of tears behind her eyes. Threatening, humiliating. Genevieve had come up with a trick to keep them at bay: She bit her tongue and imagined peppermint candy, the red-striped disks she used to steal from her neighbor&#x2019;s candy dish. The metallic tang of blood let her know she&#x2019;d bit too hard. Not for the first time.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I hope you&#x2019;re hungry,&#x201d; Dave continued, unfazed by her sullen silence. &#x201c;Because Pasquale&#x2019;s a great little cook. One thing about living in France, you eat well. Hey&#x2014;you like croissants?&#x201d;</p><p>She shrugged again.</p><p>&#x201c;You tellin&#x2019; me you&#x2019;ve never had a croissant for breakfast? How about a <i>pain au chocolat</i>? No? Why, you&#x2019;re in for a treat, darlin&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We eat whole grain at home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, well, that&#x2019;s commendable. But a genuine Parisian <i>pain au chocolat</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He trailed off with a chuckle and a shake of his head.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it breakfast time?&#x201d; Genevieve asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh no, it&#x2019;s almost suppertime. The croissants will be for tomorrow morning. We&#x2019;ll take a walk, see the neighborhood. You&#x2019;ll love it.&#x201d;</p><p>She gazed out the foggy window. It was rush hour and the streets were jammed; pedestrians made swifter progress than the cars.</p><p>&#x201c;This corner m...</p></p><h2>Confessions: St Augustine</h2><p>&#x2018;A canticle to God, and full of psychological insights that might have been written yesterday, the Confessions are the story of a soul, and also the story of God, and how he is constantly at work seeking us.&#x2019;<br><br> Confessions is perhaps the most important spiritual autobiography of all: it chronicles Saint Augustine&#x2019;s wild, dissonant youth and subsequent conversion to Christianity, as well as providing significant divine and philosophical insight. <br><br> Bestselling author, Fr Benignus O&#x2019;Rourke OSA, provides a new and luminescent translation of Confessions, his beautiful and eloquent prose shedding new light on the various shades of meaning in Saint Augustine&#x2019;s meditations and stories. <br><br> Each book is prefaced with an introduction providing further accessibility and depth of understanding to this seminal work.</p><p>Fr Benignus O&#x2019;Rourke O.S.A is an Augustinian friar and a member of the community at Clare Priory, Suffolk, and the bestselling author of Finding Your Hidden Treasure (DLT, 2010).&#x2018;... a daringly original contribution to the history of English translations of Confessions.&#x2019;<br> <br> Martin Laird, author of Into the Silent Land</p><h2>In the Palaces of Heaven</h2><p>Heaven. It is a Biblical promise that inspires awe and wonder, but one that seems unknowable until you leave this earth and your temporal body behind. But what if you could experience heaven now? What if you were meant to do it now? What if you could follow in the footsteps of Biblical examples like Enoch, Elijah, John, and Paul - all of whom experienced the heavenly realms firsthand? The truth is, God has made a way for us to experience and live in the realm that Jesus Himself ascended to after His resurrection. It is not off-limits. In fact, there is an open invitation. In this book, author Christopher Paul Carter shares his own heavenly journey. It wasn&#39;t a one-time event or a near-death experience. Rather, it was an introduction into an ongoing life in the heavenly places. There&#39;s no need to wait, the doors to heaven are open now, and God is inviting you in. Christopher Paul Carter was born in Houston, Texas and spent most of his formative years in the Carolinas and Pennsylvania. Having a passion for science, he went to college in Charleston, South Carolina to study Physics. It was during that time that he had an arresting encounter with God that changed the course of his life.

First there's an unexpected announcement from her mother. Then Grandmï¿½re arranges a national primetime interview for the brand-new crown princess of Genovia. On top of that, intriguing, exasperating letters from a secret admirer begin to arrive. </p> <p> Before she even has the chance to wonder who those letters are from, Mia is swept up in a whirlwind of royal intrigue the likes of which hasn't been seen since volume I of The Princess Diaries. </p></p><p>Fifteen-year-old Mia Thermopolis, the witty, lovable star of Meg Cabot's <i>The Princess Diaries</i>, has had it with princess lessons, also known as torture sessions: "Do they really think anyone in Genovia cares whether I know how to use a fish fork? Or if I can sit down without getting wrinkles in the back of my skirt? Or if I know how to say 'thank you' in Swahili? Shouldn't my future countrymen be more concerned with my views on the environment? And gun control? And overpopulation?" To make matters worse, she's getting these lessons from Grandmï¿½re, a rather judgmental woman who dresses her pet in chinchilla bolero jackets and has eyeliner permanently tattooed on her eyelids. <i>Princess in the Spotlight</i> further records Mia's path to princessdom: her artist mother's relationship with her algebra teacher (how awkward), her forced television interview, broadcast to all of America (how humiliating), and her crush on her best friend Lilly's brother Michael (how excruciating). The result is another thoroughly entertaining diary of a very human, very self-deprecating, very unprincesslike princess.

He explains that the only possibility for freedom from this perpetual slavery consists in transcending oneself to finally cut the cord that connects us to this central computer.</p><p>This unusual book unmasks to the public for the first time the esoteric principles of the greatest sage of ancient Egypt, Hermes Trismegistus. Baines boldly reveals how the human being is manipulated and controlled by a vast cerebral and cultural program. He explains that the only possibility for freedom from this perpetual slavery consists in transcending oneself to finally cut the cord that connects us to this central computer.Despite all appearances to the contrary, the human race has made little internal progress in two thousand years. Cunning has replaced spirituality; advances in technology conceal the fact that we are merely intelligent animals. The glitter, sparkle, and velocity of our modern life, and the continuous hum of news, advertising, television, and film keep us occupied and asleep, and conceal the harsh reality that true free will, creativity, and self-direction are mere illusions. Without quite knowing why, we experience an anxiety, inner pain, disorientation, and alienation, the escape from which becomes the hidden guiding force of our lives. <p>Humanity has been converted into a race of automatons, under the influence of a cerebral and cultural hypnosis that is nearly impossible to perceive, but which controls every aspect of our internal and external life. From cradle to grave, we struggle, enjoy, fight, love, hate, suffer, play, worry, get educated, think, work, marry, procreate, grow old, and die without ever being aware of this hypnotic condition which is part of a cerebral program from which we cannot deviate for any reason, even if we try to do so. </p><p>This book is about freedom from the slavery that afflicts the entire human race. It presents the reader with the possibility of knowing the unvarnished truth of life, and lays out the path to true happiness, self-development, and transcendence through the ancient wisdom of Hermetic Philosophy.</p></p><h2>The Encyclopedia of Double Bass Drumming</h2><p>(Percussion).

Thirteen-year-old Mai is frightened and distraught to learn that her parents have planned to leave their home and secure passage to Hong Kong. But with hopes of freedom and prosperity to spur them on, Mai and her relatives cram themselves onto a barely seaworthy boat captained by a crusty, greedy man. The voyage is difficult at best: food and water are scarce; illness, lice, rats and blazing sun plague the debilitated passengers. When they finally reach Hong Kong, the challenges of a police inspection and a camp filled with thousands of other refugees await them.

Mai is the perfect narrator through whom to introduce a large cast of unusual, sympathetic characters; her emotional control and keen observations prove to be a source of calm in the storm that swirls around her.

While the works of her male peers in literary manga are widely reprinted, this formally ambitious and poetic female voice is like none other currently available to an English readership. A master of the comics form, expert pacing and compositions combined with bold characters are signature qualities of Tsurita's work.</p><p>Tsurita&#x2019;s early stories &#x201c;Nonsense&#x201d; and &#x201c;Anti&#x201d; provide a unique, intimate perspective on the bohemian culture and political heat of late 1960s and early &#x2018;70s Tokyo. Her work gradually became darker and more surreal under the influence of modern French literature and her own prematurely failing health. As in works like &#x201c;The Sky is Blue with a Single Cloud&#x201d; and &#x201c;Max,&#x201d; the gender of many of Tsurita's strong and sensual protagonists is ambiguous, marking an early exploration of gender fluidity. Late stories like "Arctic Cold" and "Flight" show the artist experimenting with more conventional narrative modes, though with dystopian themes that extend the philosophical interests of her early work.</p><p>An exciting and essential gekiga collection, <i>The Sky is Blue with a Single Cloud</i> is translated by the comics scholar Ryan Holmberg and includes an afterword cowritten by Holmberg and manga editor Mitsuhiro Asakawa delineating Tsurita's importance and historical relevance.</p></p><p>Kuniko Tsurita was born in 1947 in Japan. In 1965, at age eighteen, while still in high school, she debuted in the legendary alt-manga monthly <i>Garo</i>, where she was the magazine&#x2019;s first and only regular female contributor until the late 1970s. Tsurita&#x2019;s early work reflects her interest in bohemian youth culture, while her later work became more surreal and dystopian, with influences ranging from modern French literature to the manga of her peers in <i>Garo</i>, including Yoshiharu Tsuge, Seiichi Hayashi, and Shigeru Mizuki, for whom she worked as an assistant for a short time in the late &#x2018;60s. In 1973, Tsurita was diagnosed with lupus, at which point specters of death began to heavily shadow her work. She died in 1985 at age thirty-seven.</p><h2>All Our Relatives: Traditional Native American Thoughts about Nature</h2><p>Through carefully chosen stories from the olden days and art that meticulously reflects traditional designs and colors, Goble provides wonderful insights into the spiritual life of the Plains Indians.

Peter created a cultural phenomenon&nbsp; with his brilliant, outrageous, hilarious, and all-too-true treatise on business and life, <em>The Peter Principle</em>&#x2014;and his words and theories are as true today as they were then. By posing&#x2014;and answering&#x2014;the eternal question, &#x201c;Why do things always go wrong?&#x201d; Peter explores the incompetence that runs so rampant through our society, our workplace, and our world in an outrageously funny yet honest and eye-opening manner. With a new foreword by Robert I. Sutton, bestselling author of <em>The No Asshole Rule</em>, this twenty-first century edition of Peter&#x2019;s classic is set to shake up the business world all over again.<br></p></p><p><p>The classic #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestseller that answers the age-old question<br>Why is incompetence so maddeningly rampant and so vexingly triumphant?</p><p>The Peter Principle, the eponymous law Dr. Laurence J. Peter coined, explains that everyone in a hierarchy&#x2014;from the office intern to the CEO, from the low-level civil servant to a nation&#x2019;s president&#x2014;will inevitably rise to his or her level of incompetence. Dr. Peter explains why incompetence is at the root of everything we endeavor to do&#x2014;why schools bestow ignorance, why governments condone anarchy, why courts dispense injustice, why prosperity causes unhappiness, and why utopian plans never generate utopias.</p><p>With the wit of Mark Twain, the psychological acuity of Sigmund Freud, and the theoretical impact of Isaac Newton, Dr. Laurence J. Peter and Raymond Hull&#x2019;s <em>The Peter Principle</em> brilliantly explains how incompetence and its accompanying symptoms, syndromes, and remedies define the world and the work we do in it.</p><p>Laurence J.

Now they immerse fans and novices alike in the history and culture of the world&#x2019;s game with&nbsp;<i>Encyclopedia Blazertannica</i>. Examining fan culture, from the famous stadium chants to the tactical variations of scarf tying, exploring the complex physics and ethics of both celebratory knee slides and fights between players, reliving the careers of legendary players, classic matches, and colorful World Cup history, and sharing a deep appreciation for the athletic brilliance and ill-judged neck tattoos that dominate the sport, this indispensable tome gives readers a front-row seat to all the action of football madness.<br><br><b>A </b><i><b>New York Times</b>&nbsp;</i><b>Bestseller!</b></p><p>ROGER BENNETT was born in Liverpool and moved to the United States after university, under the thrall of Ferris Bueller, <i>Hart to Hart,</i> and <i>Diff'rent Strokes.</i> A writer, broadcaster, and filmmaker, Bennett began at ESPN and moved with Men in Blazers to NBC Sports to become the go-to interviewer for the biggest names in soccer, making films with the likes of Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola. MICHAEL DAVIES was born in London and educated in Scotland and the United States. For twenty-eight years he has worked as a television executive and multiple Emmy Award winning producer of many shows, including <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. </i>Davies started writing for ESPN.com in 2002 before partnering with Bennett on Men in Blazers in 2010. In addition to their podcast and television show on NBC Sports, the duo have a weekly show built into the phenomenally popular EA Sports FIFA game, and have developed a large live following.<b>Introduction<br></b><br> <i>Hail! Unfortunate Accidental Readers and Great Friends of the Pod. <br></i><br> The volume you have in your hands was designed to be many things: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;The final nail in the coffin of the long-floundering publishing industry. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Living proof that it is possible to write a worse book than <i>Does God Love Michael&#x2019;s Two Daddies? </i>by Sheila K. Butt. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;An ill-advised attempt to journey into the inky dark, unexplored depths of the <i>Men in Blazers </i>universe, every detail of which we have created hand in hand with our masochistically loyal listeners over the past eight years, pod by pod, show by show, tweet by suboptimal tweet. <br><br> To achieve the first two objectives, we chose to focus solely on the third. This task demanded we wallow in the history and culture of football, the sport we both love. With its pantheon of heroes and villains, moments of glorious ecstasy and searing despair, dodgy haircuts and surplus neck tattoos, it has empowered us to experience emotions other people seem to feel in real life, to which we are both inured. No telenovela could provide soapier story lines to keep us hooked like football . . . a game with plot points that unfurl live without a safety net, as the whole world watches. <br><br> *** <br><br> Witnessing the game we love grow and grow in America, the nation that we love, has been the thrill of our lifetimes. We both arrived on these shores as innocents, equipped with full heads of our own hair, in the early 1990s. Back then soccer had seemingly forever been cast as America&#x2019;s &#x201c;Sport of the Future,&#x201d; its recent past little more than a collection of false dawns and hyperbolic predictions that it was about to become the Next Big Thing. <br><br> We well remember the day when FIFA announced its intention to host the 1994 World Cup in the US, prompting panicked former-AFL-quarterback-turned-US-representative Jack Kemp to declare on the floor of Congress: &#x201c;I think it is important for all those young men out there who someday hope to play real football where you throw it and kick it and run with it and put it in your hands a distinction should be made that football is democratic capitalism whereas soccer is a European socialist sport.&#x201d; <br><br> Yet, slow and steady wins the race. We have watched with wonder, World Cup to World Cup, as the game's profile has inexorably risen to the point that the sport&#x2019;s profile has taken its place alongside seersucker, cheesesteaks, and the collected works of Raymond Carver as a symbol of American freedom and democracy.<br><br> Indeed, our obsessive love of football and <i>Men in Blazers&#x2019; </i>very existence has been possible only because it was powered and reinforced by that surging rise of interest, as well as by the fact that you allow bald men on television in the United States. <br><br> The question is often asked as to why, season to season, week to week, game to game, more and more Americans have fallen under football&#x2019;s poetic sway. Many theories have been advanced. Just as baseball thrived in &#x201c;the Golden Age of Radio,&#x201d; and the NFL was the perfect televisual sport, soccer&#x2019;s rise has been driven by the Internet in general, and EA Sports FIFA in particular, which have enabled fans in Los Angeles or North Dakota to experience and follow their teams as closely as supporters in Leicester or Newcastle. <br><br> Also, alcohol. If a gent is in a bar drinking a beer at 7:30 in the morning, society deems him to be an alcoholic. If Liverpool are losing to Bournemouth on a television in that very same bar whilst that afore- mentioned beer is being quaffed, we consider that man an American soccer fan. If we have learned only one thing during our Guinness-stained <i>Men in Blazers </i>odyssey it is this: Never underestimate the extent to which Americans adore an excuse to drink during the daytime. <br><br> Ultimately, we like to believe football&#x2019;s American boom has been made possible by a realization that sporting audiences here have made en masse&#x2014;that when they experience soccer, they might not be watching home runs, end zone dances, or tomahawk dunks. They are glimpsing life itself unfold before their eyes. The legendary Arsenal manager Arse&#x300;ne Wenger once articulated this best when he said, &#x201c;Football is like real life but in a more condensed way, more intense. At some moments it catches you suddenly and it can be very cruel.&#x201d; <br><br> As two men, we could not be more different. One of us is an optimistic Londoner who believes everything is possible. The other, a negative Liverpudlian who sees Cossacks lurking behind every door. Yet we are bonded by a mutual understanding that soccer in all of its forms&#x2014;men&#x2019;s or women&#x2019;s, international or club&#x2014;as long as it is played by bipeds, is the key to understanding human existence. As George Eliot once said: <br><br> Art is the nearest thing to life; it is a mode of amplifying experience and extending our contact with our fellow-men beyond the bounds of our personal lot. <br><br> If you substitute the word &#x201c;football&#x201d; for &#x201c;art&#x201d; here, it could not be better said. This book, then, is for readers who believe that, or would like to. Fans old or new, young or old, deeply knowledgeable or neophyte. An encyclopedic collection assembled at great loss of life, of the greatest games, most legendary characters, soaring moments, salty chants, and the occasional self-indulgent yet critical detour, that make up everything you need to know about the game. Reading this cover to cover might not improve the way you play the sport, but it will, we hope, make you better human beings, which is arguably, almost as important. <br><br> Courage. <br> <i>Rog and Davo <br></i><br> <b>Argentina: </b>Not to go all Paul Krugman on you, but one of the most admirable things about Argentina&#x2019;s consistency as a world footballing power is that while Germany, Brazil, and Italy all rank among the world&#x2019;s ten biggest economies (and between them, they&#x2019;ve won 13 of the 20 World Cups) Argentina is the economic outlier. The team that defies the correlation between a nation&#x2019;s GDP and their ability to win the big one. <br><br> Stylistically, Argentine football has patented a long tradition of violent beauty. Their fans crave both the <i>Gambetta, </i>a slaloming style of dribbling run described by the poet Eduardo Galeano as strumming &#x201c;the ball as if it was a guitar,&#x201d; alongside a cunning guile and physicality that is known as <i>La Nuestra, </i>or &#x201c;our style of play.&#x201d; Thus, Argentine players are able to undo opponents with clinical pace, or by pinging the ball around their box, but if a groin or kidney presented itself for a good punching along the way, they could be easily persuaded to give it a thunderous jab. Thus their great team of the 1950s were known as the &#x201c;Angels with Dirty Faces.&#x201d; <br><br> This is a team who will stop at nothing to win, stooping even to handing opponents spiked water bottles during breaks to drug them in game. When England finally worked out how to beat them in 2002, thanks to a penalty won by a flopping from Michael Owen, the Argentine media merely nodded their approval at his deceit and willingness to cheat to win. &#x201c;THEY&#x2019;VE LEARNED!&#x201d; was one headline. <br><br> Yet, Argentina have always been far more than Al Davis&#x2013;era Oakland Raiders. Their team always had to be both admired and feared due to their production line of visionary, creative playmakers, <i>El Diez, </i>&#x201c;The Ten&#x201d;: Juan Romï¿½n Riquelme, and now Lionel Messi. Victory leads to sainthood. Lose, and it is all their fault. <br><br> As mighty as they have been in the past, Los Albicelestes have gone over two decades without winning a trophy. Dakota Fanning was not yet born when they lifted the 1993 Copa America. Their teams have been talent-stocked, yet their biggest problem was how to get the best out of Lionel Messi. As revered as he was, Argentines remained suspicious of the man who moved to Barcelona aged fourteen, viewing him as a foreigner, <i>El Catalï¿½n, </i>who never shone in an Argentine journey and even retired briefly from international football with tears in his eyes after misfiring in a doomed penalty shootout loss after 2016&#x2019;s Copa America Centenario final. <br><br> Despite their ongoing agony, the Argentinians find reason for optimism. The pope, Francis, was born in Buenos Aires and is football mad. Their fans draw solace from his support. &#x201c;If one Argentine can do what he does,&#x201d; they say, &#x201c;just imagine what twenty- three can do.&#x201d; <br><br> <b>Best Day of the Season: </b>The first morning of any Premier League season is among the finest days of the year. Up there in our book with Veterans Day, Memorial Day, Yom Kippur, Independence Day, Martin Luther King Day, and Churchill Day. Squads have been refreshed. New players have arrived. Everyone has a fresh new haircut. The ink on their recently acquired neck tattoos has barely dried. <br><br> Few occasions in football carry such a sense of collective anticipation and hope. Three hundred eighty games lie ahead of us over 228 days. Each an unknown voyage of discovery within which everything feels pure and possible. Rationally, the Premier League may be a set of mini leagues within a league (six teams battling for top four, four for mid-table obscurity, the rest to avoid relegation), but on the first day of the season every fan suspends disbelief and listens to their fast-beating heart which assures them that their team&#x2019;s newly acquired striker will hit the ground running and score 25 league goals, that injury-prone play- maker will have the season of his life, and the young loanee from Seville whose name is un-pronounceable will reveal himself to be a diamond in the rough. The moment before the referee&#x2019;s whistle blows is one thick with prayer. A ball has not been kicked. Dreams are not yet dashed. Everything is possible. <br><br> <b>Fighting: </b>English footballers are high-performance sportsmen who excel in every athletic pursuit except for one: They are terrible at fighting. Whilst Argentinian football players are sufficiently brazen to fire tear gas canisters at their opponents, and Brazilian football is replete with referee beheadings, Premier League violence has a ritualized choreography, part chaste Victorian courtship, part Thracian War dance in which anger must be channeled into six customary steps of erotic rutting: <br><br> <i>Step one</i>: Two players, most commonly one English hardman and one fancy foreigner from Spain or Italy who &#x201c;does not like it up &#x2019;em.&#x201d; <br><br> <i>Step two</i>: After the initial clash, Johnny Foreigner elects to &#x201c;leave a foot in.&#x201d; <br><br> <i>Step three</i>: Both players are now deprived of free will. Footballing lore dictates they must confront each other, height differential or weight class be damned. <br><br> <i>Step four</i>: Foreheads must be placed in the general vicinity of opponents like bull elks rutting to prove their dominance in front of the herd. <br><br> <i>Step five</i>: Both players pray for the slightest contact, mere molecule grazing satisfactory. <br><br> <i>Step six</i>: Contact or imagined contact is sufficient cause for player to fling himself backward in the style of Capa&#x2019;s &#x201c;Falling Soldier.&#x201d; NB: If the player toppling backward is Johnny Foreigner, cue color commentator to declare &#x201c;We need to stamp that behavior out of the game.&#x201d; If the player is English hardman expect, color commentary to effect of &#x201c;He must have felt something, because he is not that type of player.&#x201d; <br><br> <b>Judge Ivor Bennett Time: </b>My father had two footballing rules he lived by. The first was &#x201c;It only takes a second to score a goal.&#x201d; A relentlessly optimistic phrase he would habitually utter whenever Everton went behind in a game. As a child, I drew tremendous comfort from those words, only for my faith to be shattered in 1982 when Liverpool demolished Everton 5&#x2013;0. As the clock ticked past the 90th minute, I remember turning round to my father and inquiring innocently, &#x201c;We can still get back into this game, right, Dad? There are still at least five seconds left&#x2014;we could score five goals in those seconds because it only takes a second to score a goal.&#x201d; After watching his footballing gods proven to have feet of clay, my father was in no mood to indulge me. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be stupid,&#x201d; he spat sharply. &#x201c;Only a fool would believe in that ridiculous clichï¿½.&#x201d; <br><br> My father&#x2019;s second rule lives on. He firmly believes goals scored either in the 44th minute of the first half or the 46th of the second were debilitating for the conceding team. The first because their manager would have to tear up his halftime tactical talk and brief his team on the fly. The second because whatever instructions handed out in the locker room had immediately been rendered irrelevant. <br><br> If we are watching an Everton game and the team concede around the halftime break, his muttering groan of &#x201c;that is the worst time to let in a goal&#x201d; stings like salt in a wound. For what it is worth, his other great belief is that bedrooms should be kept cold. Very cold and damp, if possible. In Judge Ivor Bennett&#x2019;s mind, &#x201c;a cold room is the first value that leads to success.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;RB <br></b><br> <b>Mullets: </b>A bi-level haircut named from <i>molet </i>(fourteenth-century Middle English), <i>mulet </i>(Anglo-French), <i>mullus </i>(Latin), and <i>myllos </i>(Greek), the hairstyle has secreted its traces across history, appearing first on the Sphinx in Giza, being imported to North America on the head of Revolutionary War general Horatio Gates, and then perfected by <i>Facts of Life</i>&#x2013;era George Clooney. The cut has many power bases, including the American South and in minor hockey leagues all over the Canadian prairie, yet few cultures have been such a global melting pot for the mullet as World Football. Its popularity can perhaps be explained by its ability to communicate so many different things. The &#x201c;South American Mullet&#x201d; owned by Kun Agï¿½ero when he broke through with Atlï¿½tico said &#x201c;Baller.&#x201d; Mesut O&#x30b;zil&#x2019;s blond &#x201c;Mullet of Youth&#x201d; said &#x201c;I think differently.&#x201d; Newcastle and Spurs icon Chris Waddle&#x2019;s &#x201c;Northern Mullett&#x201d; said &#x201c;It&#x2019;s 1990 and I am English.&#x201d; The 1980s Bulgarian defender Trifon Ivanov&#x2019;s &#x201c;Eastern European Enforcer Mullet&#x201d; said &#x201c;I give you Levi&#x2019;s, you be wife?,&#x201d; and US 1994 goalkeeping hero Tony Meola&#x2019;s &#x201c;Jersey Chic&#x201d; do screamed &#x201c;I am just lookin&#x2019; for a haircut that looks cool with stonewashed denim.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Complete Peanuts 1955-1956: Vol. 3 Paperback Edition</h2><p>The third volume in our the best-selling and acclaimed series takes us into the mid-1950s as Linus learns to talk, Snoopy begins to explore his eccentricities (including his hilarious first series of impressions), Lucy&#x2019;s unrequited crush on Schroeder takes final shape, and Charlie Brown becomes... well, even more Charlie Brown-ish! This volume includes an introduction by Matt Groening (The Simpsons).</p><p>In 1955-56, the Peanuts gang may have still been in first grade (or lower), but the characters continue to grow into their distinctive and unmistakable personalities. Snoopy overcomes some embarrassment to reveal his talent for impressions (wolf, rhino, alligator, kangaroo, Violet, etc.) and his joyous dance-the-day-away attitude. Linus adopts the same attitude ("Five hundred years from now, who'll know the difference?") and continues to show his genius in such diverse activities as square balloons, snow sculptures, and air sketches, even though he has to resort to wishful violence against his bullying sister. Lucy, now a ripe old 4, has to face such concerns as the Earth being worn down by people's feet and whether Santa exists. And already concerned about getting married, she tries to divert Schroeder's attention from Beethoven either by logic (what's the sense in learning Beethoven sonatas if you don't win a prize?), by sympathy ("My favorite piece is Bach's Toccata and Fugue in Asia Minor"), or by violence, and pulls away the football from Charlie Brown for the first time (December 1956). She also teaches her brother "little-known facts" about the world (palm trees were so named because people can fit their hand around them), which gives Charlie Brown stomach aches and formed part of the stage musical <i>You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown</i>. But she'll never lose an argument as long as she can end it with a well-placed insult. Such is the misery of Charlie Brown, who also has to endure his failure to fly a kite, his complete failure on the baseball diamond, and misery during any holiday. That he does endure, however, makes him one of the heroes of our time. The third volume of Fantagraphics Books' handsome <i>Complete Peanuts</i> series includes a foreword by Matt Groening and a Charles M. Schulz retrospective by Gary Groth. <i>--David Horiuchi</i><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.</p><p><strong>Matt Groening</strong> (b. 1954) is an Emmy Award-winner, best known for co-creating animated TV series such as <em>The Simpsons</em>&nbsp; and <em>Futurama</em>. He also cartooned a long-running alt-weekly strip called <em>Life In Hell</em>, for which he won a Rueben.</p></p><h2>From the Heart of the Crow Country: The Crow Indians&#39; Own Stories</h2><p>The world of the Crow Indians comes to life in this extraordinary collection of stories from respected elder and famed storyteller Joseph Medicine Crow.

It was a plastic one Vance had stolen from a department-store mannequin. But it looked real enough through the glass of the tank, which was how all the trouble started.<br> <br>Vance was the toughest, meanest kid at my middle school. He was in the eighth grade, but he&#x2019;d been held back. Twice. Which made him a fifteen-year-old eighth grader. Plus, he was big for his age, nearly six feet tall with biceps as thick as Burmese pythons. Every other kid looked like a dwarf next to him.<br> <br>There was a very long list of things I didn&#x2019;t like about Lyndon B. Johnson Middle School, but Vance was at the top of it. He&#x2019;d been bullying me since my first day of seventh grade&#x2014;and it was now mid-December. I didn&#x2019;t know what he had against me. Maybe it was because I was new at the school and thus fresh meat. Or maybe it was that, having spent most of my childhood in the Congo, I was different from all the other kids. Whatever the case, Vance homed in on me like he was a lion and I was the weakest wildebeest in the herd.<br> <br>Vance stole my lunch. He gave me wedgies. He flushed my homework down the toilet. I reported these incidents to my parents, who angrily informed the school principal, Mr. Dillnut. Unfortunately, Mr. Dillnut was afraid of Vance himself. So he merely threatened Vance with detention&#x2014;and then ratted me out as the kid who&#x2019;d squealed. If anything, this made Vance even more determined to harass me. And now he warned that if I ever got him sent to the principal again, he&#x2019;d hurt me.<br> <br>So I fought back the only way I knew how: I played pranks on him. Covertly, of course. I filled his locker with aerosol cheese. I submerged a dead roach in his chocolate pudding. I caught a king snake and hid it in his gym bag. That one worked out the best. Vance was changing in the boys&#x2019; locker room when the snake popped out and scared him silly. Vance shrieked like a girl and fled into the gym, forgetting that he was only in his underwear until he found himself face-to-face with the entire cheerleading squad.<br> <br>Unfortunately, the snake tipped my hand. I&#x2019;d kept my identity as the prankster secret until that point, but I was well-known at school for being good with animals. My mother was a world-famous primatologist, my father was a world-famous wildlife photographer, and I lived with both of them at FunJungle, the world&#x2019;s largest zoo. Vance quickly deduced that I&#x2019;d planted the snake and came looking for payback.<br> <br><br> <br>He found me in the cafeteria on Monday, having lunch with Xavier Gonzalez. Xavier was my best friend at school. In fact he was my only friend at school. He was an outsider too, a smart kid who&#x2019;d once made the terrible social error of admitting that he actually enjoyed his classes. Before I&#x2019;d come along, Xavier had been Vance&#x2019;s favorite target.<br> <br>There was a distinct hierarchy to the seating in the school cafeteria. The coolest kids, known as the Royals, sat in the center, where they could be seen and admired. These were the eighth-grade jocks and cheerleaders, plus a few rich kids. They were surrounded by the Lower Royals: the younger jocks, cheerleaders, and rich kids who would assume the throne someday. Then came almost everyone else: the normal kids who hoped to be popular, but knew it would probably never happen. At the very corners sat the lowest of the low, whom even the normal kids looked down on: the losers, loners, and freaks who hadn&#x2019;t mastered how to fit in.<br> <br>I had spent every lunch so far in one of the corners with Xavier. So it wasn&#x2019;t hard for Vance to find me.<br> <br>As usual, Xavier and I were talking about FunJungle. Most of my fellow students liked FunJungle&#x2014;after all, it was the biggest tourist attraction in all of Central Texas&#x2014;but Xavier was a FunJungle fanatic. He had more than twenty different FunJungle T-shirts (not to mention sweatshirts, caps, pins, and other assorted merchandise) and claimed that the day the park had opened was the greatest day of his life. He wanted to be a field biologist when he grew up and idolized my mother the way other kids revered rock stars. He&#x2019;d read everything he could find about her, so he knew all about me before I&#x2019;d even set foot in the school. He&#x2019;d sought me out on my first day at Lyndon B. Johnson, wanting to know if I could introduce him to Mom.<br> <br>Xavier generally spent every lunch peppering me with questions about FunJungle. The day that Vance came after me, we happened to be talking about Shark Odyssey, which was one of the more popular exhibits. It was a huge aquarium with a glass tunnel running through it, from which guests could watch sharks swimming all around them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t that drive the sharks crazy?&#x201d; Xavier wanted to know. &#x201c;It must be like waving red meat in front of a bear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sharks don&#x2019;t really eat humans,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;In fact, most attacks seem to be accidents. The sharks usually spit the humans back out after biting them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Xavier said. &#x201c;But still, they&#x2019;re hunters, right? And now all these humans are moving right through their habitat. It must trigger some sort of primal instinct.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shook my head. &#x201c;No. In the first place, the glass tunnel is lined with some kind of reflective surface, so the sharks can&#x2019;t see the humans from inside. And even if they could, sharks don&#x2019;t really hunt by sight. They hunt by smell&#x2014;and by sensing vibrations in the water. You could drop a whole mannequin in the shark tank and the sharks probably wouldn&#x2019;t even give it a second look.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I bet it&#x2019;d freak the guests out, though,&#x201d; Xavier laughed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I agreed. &#x201c;It would be pretty funny.&#x201d;<br> <br>Xavier stopped laughing at that point, which I should have taken as a sign that something was wrong, but I was too caught up thinking about the prank. I kept rambling on, unaware that Vance Jessup was bearing down on me. &#x201c;Know what would really freak the guests out? If you only put part of a mannequin in the tank. Like just an arm. So it&#x2019;d look like the sharks had already eaten the rest. That would be hilarious.&#x201d;<br> <br>Now, Vance decided to make his presence known. He grabbed my chair and spun me around to face him. &#x201c;What would be hilarious?&#x201d; he demanded. &#x201c;Are you planning another prank on me?&#x201d;<br> <br>I gulped, terrified, and did my best to lie to Vance&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;What are you talking about? I&#x2019;ve never played any pranks on you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know you put that snake in my gym bag, Monkey Boy. And you&#x2019;re gonna pay for it.&#x201d; Vance held up a clenched fist the size of a grapefruit.<br> <br>I recoiled, aware this wasn&#x2019;t an idle threat. Vance got in fights almost every day&#x2014;and usually won. He was covered with bruises, scratches, and scrapes, though his opponents generally looked far worse. He was currently sporting a half dozen Band-Aids dappled with blood that was probably someone else&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Meanwhile, I&#x2019;d never been in a fight in my life. I wouldn&#x2019;t stand a chance against Vance.<br> <br>&#x201c;Teddy wasn&#x2019;t talking about playing a prank on you,&#x201d; Xavier said quickly, trying to bail me out. &#x201c;He was talking about playing a prank at FunJungle. Dropping a fake human arm into the shark tank to make all the guests freak out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Vance lowered his fist. His sneer faded and he made a strange noise. At first I thought he was choking&#x2014;but then realized he was laughing. &#x201c;That would be funny,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;When are you going to do it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Er . . . never,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I only meant it would be funny in theory. I would never really do something like that. It might start a panic&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; Vance said, and then laughed again. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do it after school tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shook my head and tried to come up with a believable excuse. &#x201c;Sorry, but it&#x2019;s not possible. There&#x2019;s a ton of security at FunJungle. They&#x2019;d catch us if we tried to sneak the arm inside.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, they&#x2019;d catch me if I tried to sneak the arm inside,&#x201d; Vance corrected. &#x201c;Not you. You don&#x2019;t have to go through the main entrance.&#x201d;<br> <br>I winced. I hadn&#x2019;t expected Vance to know that. I struggled to come up with something else. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have a fake arm, either . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Leave that to me,&#x201d; Vance said. &#x201c;I can steal one from the department store in town.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, now that I think about it,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think this would be that good a prank at all. But I&#x2019;ll tell you what might be a lot more fun. Maybe I could get you a backstage tour of the shark exhibit. It&#x2019;s pretty fascinating. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Vance&#x2019;s eyes narrowed in anger. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want a tour of some dumb shark tank.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s not dumb,&#x201d; Xavier put in, trying to be helpful. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s actually quite amazing. In fact, it&#x2019;s the largest shark tank in the world, housing over thirty different species&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shut up,&#x201d; Vance told him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Xavier said, backing down.<br> <br>Vance clamped a hand on my shoulder. &#x201c;I want to play this prank,&#x201d; he informed me. &#x201c;And I need your help to do it. So you&#x2019;re going to help me, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>I wished I&#x2019;d had the nerve to stand up to Vance right then and there and tell him what I really thought of him. But my shoulder was already in terrible pain, and Vance wasn&#x2019;t even squeezing that hard yet. I got the sense that if he wanted to, he could snap me like a twig. And yet I still hesitated before giving Vance an answer.<br> <br>That didn&#x2019;t please him at all. &#x201c;Trust me on this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to be my enemy. Before I heard about this shark-tank thing, I was about to pound your face in. I&#x2019;d still be happy to do that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; I said desperately, wanting to keep my face the way it was. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, then.&#x201d; Vance released me and flashed a cruel smile. &#x201c;See you tomorrow afternoon.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>So that&#x2019;s how I ended up dropping fake body parts into Shark Odyssey.<br> <br>Vance cornered me right after school the next day. True to his word, he&#x2019;d obtained the arm of a mannequin&#x2014;and a foot as well. &#x201c;The more body parts the better,&#x201d; he explained. Just in case I&#x2019;d managed to work up the nerve to say no to him&#x2014;which I&#x2019;d been working on for the past twenty-four hours&#x2014;he&#x2019;d brought along two bullies-in-training: Jim and Tim Barksdale. The Barksdales were identical twins in the eighth grade. They were so dumb and mean that everyone, even their parents, had trouble telling them apart. Since they were rarely without each other, everyone simply called them TimJim.<br> <br>Vance had hidden the mannequin parts in a large backpack, which he insisted I take with me on the school bus. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even go home,&#x201d; he threatened. &#x201c;Take it right to the sharks. We&#x2019;ll be waiting for you there. If you try to chicken out&#x2014;or tip off security&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll come find you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And then maybe we&#x2019;ll feed you to the sharks,&#x201d; either Tim or Jim said.<br> <br>The boys all laughed at this.<br> <br>I felt like throwing up, but I didn&#x2019;t really see that I had a choice. So I left my regular backpack in my locker, took my homework and Vance&#x2019;s backpack, and hopped onto the school bus. Xavier, who rode the same bus as me, volunteered to come to Shark Odyssey as moral support&#x2014;although I suspected he was actually more interested in getting to sneak into FunJungle the back way with me. &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I told him, &#x201c;but I should probably do this alone. Maybe I can trick Vance into doing it himself and get him busted for it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t do that,&#x201d; Xavier warned. &#x201c;If Vance catches on, it&#x2019;ll only make him angrier at you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t catch on,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a moron. The guy&#x2019;s flunked eighth grade twice.&#x201d;<br> <br>Xavier shook his head. &#x201c;Vance didn&#x2019;t flunk because he&#x2019;s stupid. He flunked because he&#x2019;s lazy. In fact, Vance is smarter than most people realize. If he put as much thought into studying as he does into being cruel and mean, he&#x2019;d be graduating college by now.&#x201d;<br> <br>I thought back to my many nasty encounters with Vance and realized Xavier was right. Vance was actually quite clever; he just used his gifts for evil. For example, he knew how to make his own cherry bombs with chemicals he&#x2019;d pilfered from the science lab. &#x201c;So what should I do?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pull the prank as fast as possible,&#x201d; Xavier advised, &#x201c;and pray you don&#x2019;t get caught.&#x201d;<br> <br>My bus stop was the last one, as FunJungle was located several miles from town. Technically it wasn&#x2019;t located in any school district; a special exemption had been made for me, the only child living there, to attend Lyndon B. Johnson.<br> <br>FunJungle was so big it actually qualified as its own city. The park had been built by J.J. McCracken, a local billionaire. He claimed he&#x2019;d done it for his daughter, Summer&#x2014;but the fact that 175 million people visited zoos in America every year had certainly influenced him as well. FunJungle was officially a zoo&#x2014;the world&#x2019;s biggest, by far&#x2014;though, to attract tourists, it was also part theme park. There were thrill rides, stage shows, themed hotels, and plenty of innovative exhibits, like a massive African habitat where you could go on a safari and several pools where you could swim with dolphins. Despite the gimmicks, however, FunJungle was committed to providing top-quality care for its animals. J.J. had hired lots of distinguished biologists (like my mother) and had shelled out big bucks to make the animal exhibits state-of-the-art. The whole park was nearly ten miles square, with its own police department, fire station, and hospital. (Technically it was an animal hospital, but it was nicer than most human hospitals and had a physician on staff for any FunJungle employees who got sick.)<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t really live at FunJungle per se. There was a trailer park behind the safari area that served as free housing for the distinguished biologists and their families. As Vance had ordered, I didn&#x2019;t go home once the bus dropped me off. But then I never did. There was no point in sitting in our trailer all by myself. Not when Mom&#x2019;s office was nice and cozy and had windows that looked into the gorilla exhibit. Many days I went straight there to do my homework, but if anything interesting was happening at FunJungle&#x2014;and there often was&#x2014;I&#x2019;d go there instead. Thus Mom didn&#x2019;t really expect me to show up at any specific time. And as for Dad, he was generally roaming the park taking pictures&#x2014;if he was even at the park. His contract allowed him to accept freelance jobs as well. He&#x2019;d just returned from photographing anacondas in the Amazon for National Geographic a few days earlier.<br> <br>I entered the park through the rear employee entry booth, which was next to the employee parking lot and the trailer park. Darlene, the guard posted inside, barely gave me a glance as I entered. She was watching a downloaded movie on her iPhone, which was probably a violation of sixteen different security directives, but on that day I didn&#x2019;t care. I didn&#x2019;t want any scrutiny.<br> <br>The entry booth wasn&#x2019;t much bigger than a storage closet. On one side a door led in from employee parking. On the other side a door led into FunJungle. Darlene sat between them next to a metal detector. &#x201c;Hey, Teddy, how was school?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Same as usual.&#x201d; I set the backpack down by Darlene, passed through the metal detector, and grabbed the pack again without giving her the chance to rifle through it. Not that she tried. Darlene hadn&#x2019;t examined my things once in the last six months. However, she did...</p><h2>Catching Readers Before They Fall: Supporting Readers Who Struggle, K-4</h2><p>Every teacher of reading plays a vital role in helping to catch those readers for whom learning to read does not come easily.

The simple fact is that many revered investment theories and market models are flatly wrong&#x2014;that is, if we insist that they work in the real world. Unfounded assumptions, erroneous theories, unrealistic models, cognitive biases, emotional foibles, and unsubstantiated beliefs all combine to lead investors astray&#x2014;professionals as well as novices. In this engaging new book, Jack Schwager, bestselling author of <i>Market Wizards</i> and <i>The New Market Wizards</i>, takes aim at the most perniciously pervasive academic precepts, money management canards, market myths and investor errors. Like so many ducks in a shooting gallery, Schwager picks them off, one at a time, revealing the truth about many of the fallacious assumptions, theories, and beliefs at the core of investment theory and practice.</p> <ul> <li>A compilation of the most insidious, fundamental investment errors the author has observed over his long and distinguished career in the markets</li> <li>Brings to light the fallacies underlying many widely held academic precepts, professional money management methodologies, and investment behaviors</li> <li>A sobering dose of real-world insight for investment professionals and a highly readable source of information and guidance for general readers interested in investment, trading, and finance</li> <li>Spans both traditional and alternative investment classes, covering both basic and advanced topics</li> <li>As in his best-selling <i>Market Wizard</i> series, Schwager manages the trick of covering material that is pertinent to professionals, yet writing in a style that is clear and accessible to the layman</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>From the Author: "(Almost) Everything You Know About Investment Is Wrong"</b></p> Jack D. Schwager <p>When it comes to the markets, academics, professionals and novice investors have one thing in common: They all operate on assumptions that fail to hold up in the harsh light of reality. The following are a sampling of observations about how markets really work:</p> <ol> <li>The market is not always right. The best opportunities arise when the market is most wrong.</li> <li>Big price moves begin on fundamentals but end on emotion.</li> <li>Past returns are not future returns. Past returns can be very misleading if there are reasons to believe that future market conditions are likely to be significantly different from those that shaped past returns.</li> <li>The best-performing past investments often do worse than the worst-performing past investments in the future--and the future after all is where we all have to make our investment decisions. </li> <li>The best time to initiate long-term investments in equities is after extended periods of underperformance.</li> <li>Faulty risk measurement is worse than no risk measurement at all because it will lull investors into unwarranted complacency.</li> <li>Volatility is frequently a poor proxy for risk. Many low volatility investments have high risk, while some high volatility investments have well-controlled risk. </li> <li>The real risks are often invisible in the track record.</li> <li>High past returns sometimes reflect excessive risk-taking in a favorable market environment rather than manager skill. </li> <li>Return alone is a meaningless statistic because return can always be increased by increasing risk. Return/risk should be the primary performance metric.</li> <li>Leverage alone tells you nothing about risk. Risk is a function of both the underlying portfolio and leverage. Leveraged portfolios can often be lower risk than unleveraged portfolios--it depends on the assets in the portfolio.</li> </ol><p>When it comes to investment models and theories of how markets work, convenience usually trumps reality. The simple fact is that many revered investment theories and market models are flatly wrong&#x2014;that is, if we insist that they work in the real world. Unfounded assumptions, erroneous theories, unrealistic models, cognitive biases, emotional foibles, and unsubstantiated beliefs all combine to lead investors astray&#x2014;professionals as well as novices.</p> In this engaging new book, Jack Schwager, bestselling author of the <i>Market Wizards</i> series, takes aim at some of the most pervasive market precepts, money management misconceptions, and irrational investor behaviors. From the theory of efficient markets to buying in up markets and selling in down markets, Schwager turns each misguided idea on its head, one at a time. Supported by a wealth of well-documented historical evidence and a healthy dose of common sense, he exposes the truth about the cherished assumptions and fallacious thinking at the core of some of the most respected investment theories and models and explores many common investor errors. In this book, you'll discover why: <ul> <li>Expert opinion is NOT more reliable than the proverbial dart-throwing chimp</li> <li>The markets are NOT efficient</li> <li>Low volatility does NOT necessarily imply low risk, and high volatility does NOT necessarily imply high risk</li> <li>Market prices are NOT normally distributed</li> <li>Investing in equities when markets are doing well is NOT conducive to achieving above-average returns</li> <li>Concentrating on funds with the strongest record of returns is NOT a sound strategy</li> <li>Past returns are NOT a reliable indicator of future performance</li> <li>A hedge fund portfolio strategy is NOT riskier than a traditional portfolio approach</li> <li>VaR does NOT provide a good indication of worst-case risk</li> <li>Superior performance does NOT necessarily imply manager skill</li> </ul> <p>But Schwager does much more than simply burst bubbles; he offers a sobering draught of real-world investment insight and guidance spanning both traditional and alternative investment classes. Drawing upon his years as an asset manager and trader, he shares priceless lessons on an array of investing topics, both basic and advanced, including portfolio management, risk assessment, investment selection, hedge fund investing, investment timing, and much more.</p> <p><i>Market Sense and Nonsense</i> is an indispensable source of real-world market wisdom and investing know-how for investors of every ilk.</p></p><h2>Cultural Resource Laws and Practice (Heritage Resource Management Series)</h2><p>With its updated analysis and treatments of key topics, this new edition is a must-have for archaeologists and students, historic preservationists, tribal governments, and others working with cultural resources.</p><p>Thomas F. King has worked in historic preservation since the mid-1960s as an academic, a contractor, and a government official.Tom King has played a unique role in CRM as one of the architects of the original Section 106 regulations and the discipline&#x2019;s most articulate explicator and critic. This purportedly final edition has updated regulatory detail, recent examples, and sharpened critique. This book is essential reading for those interested in historic preservation including CRM practitioners and civil servants. One hopes that the latter might actually heed King&#x2019;s well-reasoned rejoinders for the critical need to reform the regulation and management of our nation&#x2019;s cultural resources. (Steve Black, Texas State University)<br><br>Each of King&#x2019;s books is a must read, and Cultural Resource Laws and Practice most of all. In it, King transforms the complexities of heritage management into a veritable page-turner. Like the first edition, this fourth is a definitive how-to guide. But it&#x2019;s also a critique, based on decades of experience. Readers will value Cultural Resource Laws and Practice as much for King&#x2019;s insights on changing the system as for his instructions on working it.

With comic book-style illustrations and engaging, easy-to-read text, this biography will inspire, entertain, and inform young readers about an individual who made a significant contribution to society. An additional information section provides key facts and further understanding, making this graphic novel a must-have in any home, classroom, or library.</p><p>David Seidman is a Capstone AuthorThis new graphic nonfiction series offers biographical treatments that highlight a technological breakthrough or innovation. Though produced by various illustrators, titles are visually similar: enticing covers, dynamic fonts, bold colors, and vibrant illustrations. Comic book-style word balloons feature fairly sophisticated vocabulary and occasional quotes or other primary source material. Each selection includes titled chapters, a table of contents, summary fact pages, further reading suggestions, and recommended Internet sites. There is close correlation between the dialogue and depicted actions and illustrations, which will provide visual reinforcement for struggling readers. These deceptively slim volumes convey a tremendous amount of information and vocabulary, and should attract attention from reluctant and enthusiastic readers alike. Bibliography. Glossary. Index. Recommended. --Library Media Connection; Vol. 25, No. 7; Pages 83-84, April 2007<br><br>The Graphic Library series books are perfect for both boys and girls who want to learn in an interesting way. What child does not like learning from a book that is in graphic style? This particular book is part of the Inventions and Discoveries series. Today, we take it for grated with our cell phones and computers, that we can send and receive information in seconds. In the 1800 s when Morse s mother was ill, it took a letter a week to reach him, and he had no idea if she was still alive when he left to go 3,000 miles to see her. He became obsessed with the idea of using electricity as a means of conveying information at a fast rate and pursued this idea with great vigor. He was fortunate to live and see his Morse code and telegraph become two of America s greatest inventions. It is amazing how much information is given to the reader in just 32 pages. This book would be perfect in a classroom or school library. It also lends itself to the science and social studies classroom libraries. Graphic format makes it perfect for students who are reluctant readers and never seem to finish a book on their own or for young adults who want to read anything they can get their hands on. The full-color graphics make an enormous impact on the story. The author inserts a box on most pages that includes narration, giving extra facts to the reader to help with comprehension. Vocabulary has been well selected, and this book is an excellent resource that could be used for writing a summary, a book report, or a full research project. At the end of the book, the author includes more facts about Morse and the telegraph, a glossary, a list of internet sites, additional books for more information, and a bibliography. I highly recommend this book. --Childrens Literature Comprehensive Database, January 2007<br><br>Finalist of the 2007 Distinguished Achievement Award --Association of Educational Publishers, June 2007</p><h2>The Complete Guide to Auto Body Repair, 2nd Edition (Motorbooks Workshop)</h2><p><p><b>Everything you need to know about auto body repair--updated and revised to cover water-based paints, the latest panel adhesives, and other body repair technologies.</b></p><p>The only thing more reliable than rising gas prices is the wear and tear your car endures over its lifetime.

Coming to America as a child, he travelled widely&#x2014;as far West as Utah, as far East as New York, and a lot of places in between. He never stayed long in one place, however, until he settled in North Carolina after World War II. He attended college at Wichita State, where he played football, and later at Columbia. During these years his jobs included harvest hand, cowboy, bouncer in a tough roadhouse, and newspaper work&#x2014;before he began to write full time in the 1930s. Since 1951 he and his wife lived in Chapel Hill&#x2014;with frequent excursions to his cabin high on the slopes of Walnut Mountain in Madison County, North Carolina. He is the author of some sixty-five books and several hundred stories and articles. His books include biographies, regional histories, juveniles, mainstream fiction, mystery novels, science fiction and fantasy. Wellman was among the most popular writers for the legendary Weird Tales, where some fifty of his stories appeared. His best known work, the haunting stories of John the Balladeer, won great acclaim in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, and were collected for the classic Arkham House book, Who Fears the Devil?&#x2014;which has become one of the most prized volumes from that venerable publisher.<p>In his later years Wellman worked mostly in other areas of writing, but in the late 1970s he returned to the field of fantasy and horror, producing nearly two-dozen new short stories, as well as eight novels, many featuring his creations John the Balladeer and John Thunstone. He died in 1986.</p></p><h2>Ambush at Corellia (Star Wars, The Corellian Trilogy #1)</h2><p>A trade summit on Corellia brings Han Solo back&nbsp;&nbsp;to the home world he left many years before.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arriving on the distant planet with Leia, their children&nbsp;&nbsp;and Chewbacca, Han finds Corellia overrun with&nbsp;&nbsp;agents of the New Republic Intelligence and finds&nbsp;&nbsp;himself part of a deceptive plan whose aim not even&nbsp;&nbsp;he understands. One thing is clear: the five&nbsp;&nbsp;inhabited worlds of the sector are on the brink of civil&nbsp;&nbsp;war and the once peaceful coexistence of the three&nbsp;&nbsp;leading races -- human, Selonian, and Drallan --&nbsp;&nbsp;has come to an end.</p><p><b>Roger MacBride Allen</b>&nbsp;is the author of several SF novels, including a number in the Star Wars universe, as well as his own Chronicles of Solace space opera trilogy. He lives in Maryland.CHAPTER ONE<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Visible Secrets<br> &nbsp;<br> All right, Chewie, try it now.&#x201d; Han Solo stuffed the comlink back in his pocket and stepped back a bit from the Millennium Falcon, an anxious look on his face. It ought to work this time. But that was what they had figured the time before, and the time before that. He could see into the Falcon&#x2019;s cockpit viewports from where he stood, and Chewbacca didn&#x2019;t look all that confident, either. He saw Chewbacca reach for the lift controls. Han realized that he had been holding his breath, and forced himself to exhale.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Millennium Falcon shifted slightly on her hard stand, then rose slowly into the evening air. Chewie took her up until the landing pads were at Han&#x2019;s eye level, and held her there.<br> &nbsp;<br> Han pulled out the comlink again and spoke into it. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Good. Now engage the shields.&#x201d; The air all around the Falcon seemed to shimmer a bit, and then steadied down.<br> &nbsp;<br> Han stepped back just a bit farther, not wishing to be all that close when Chewie cut the repulsors. &#x201c;All right, Chewie, repulsors&#x2014;off!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The glow of the repulsors dimmed, and the Falcon dropped abruptly&#x2014;and stopped, suspended in midair, with the landing pads waist-high off the ground. Sparks and scintillations flared and flickered here and there on the hard stand as the shields&#x2019; energy webs shifted under stress.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Han said. &#x201c;Very good.&#x201d; Short of firing a turbo-laser at the ship from point-blank range, it was about as good a field test of overall shield strength as you could ask for. If the shields could support the weight of the ship, then they could&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly the sparking grew brighter, fiercer, just under the number-two landing pad. &#x201c;Chewie! Repulsors on! It&#x2019;s going to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> With a shuddering flash of light, the rear shields blew out. The aft landing pads slammed into the hard stand with a bone-rattling impact that sent Han sprawling. The forward end of the ship hung in midair as the rear half bounced on its jacks, back up into the air.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just as the rear of the ship was at the peak of its travel, the forward shields died. In the same instant the forward repulsors flared to life. The rear repulsors came on, lighting a split second after the forward units, and flickering a bit. Getting slammed into the pavement like that hadn&#x2019;t done the rear repulsor coils any good, that was for sure. Still, Chewie had timed the recovery nicely. Han had seen ships flipped onto their backs trying to recover from a failed shield hover.<br> &nbsp;<br> Chewie brought the Falcon back down to a gentle landing and cut the repulsors. A moment later the gangway lowered itself and Chewie came out, clearly none too happy with the situation. He made a loud bugling noise, turned back up the gangway, and returned a moment later carrying a shield-tuning set.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was not good. After all the years Han had spent with Chewie, he knew better than to let a frustrated Wookiee vent his feelings on a repair job. He was just as likely to tear the shield generator out by the roots as he was to retune it. &#x201c;Ah, maybe that&#x2019;s not such a good idea, Chewie. Leave it for now. We&#x2019;ll come back to it tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Chewbacca roared and threw the tool kit down.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know, I know, I know,&#x201d; Han said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s taking longer than it should, and you&#x2019;re tired of tweaking up subsystems that we optimized last week. But that&#x2019;s the way it is on a ship like the Falcon. She&#x2019;s a finely tuned instrument. Everything affects everything else. Adjust one system and everything else reacts. The only way not to go through this would be to scrap her and start over&#x2014;and you don&#x2019;t want to scrap the Falcon, do you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Chewie looked back toward the ship with an expression that told Han not to press his luck on that point. The Wookiee had never felt as deeply for the Falcon as Han had, and even Han knew the old girl would have to be retired someday. Sooner or later it would be the scrap heap for her&#x2014;or a museum, more likely. That was an odd thought, but after all, the Falcon had made more than her share of history.<br> &nbsp;<br> But just now the key thing was to get Chewbacca calmed down, or away from the shield system&#x2014;or, preferably, both.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tomorrow,&#x201d; Han said. &#x201c;Back at it tomorrow. For now, let&#x2019;s leave it, all right? Leia&#x2019;s probably waiting dinner on us, anyway.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The mention of food seemed to brighten Chewbacca up&#x2014;as Han had intended that it do. Wookiee management was a full-time chore, and then some. Now and then Han wondered just how much effort Chewbacca put into Han management. But that was another point to consider later. It was time to knock off for the day.<br> &nbsp;<br> Amazing, how times changed, how time changed life. After all the close calls, all the battles, all the captures and rescues and risks and victories Han had been through, now it came down to getting home to dinner. I&#x2019;m a family man now, Han told himself, still a bit amazed by the fact. And perhaps the most amazing thing of all was how much he liked being one.<br> &nbsp;<br> Han Solo looked up into the evening sky of Coruscant. What was it now? Eighteen years? Eighteen years since he had hired on to fly a crazy old man named Ben Kenobi and a kid named Luke Skywalker out of Tatooine. Taking on that job had changed his life forever&#x2014;and changed the course of galactic history, if you wanted to get grandiose about it.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was nine years since the defeat of Grand Admiral Thrawn and the Dark Jedi Master. Nine years since the birth of the twins, and just over seven since Anakin was born.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Captain Solo?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a female voice that pulled him out of his reverie. The voice was low and throaty, and came from behind him. Han did not recognize it. The unknown voice sounded dangerous, somehow. It was a little too quiet, too calm, too cool.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Han replied, turning around slowly. &#x201c;My name is Solo.&#x201d; A small, slight, dark-skinned human, a woman, stepped out of the shadows by the hangar entrance. She wore a dark blue uniform that might be one of the Republic Navy branches, but then it might not. Han was not up-to-date on what the navy was wearing these days. &#x201c;Who might you be?&#x201d; he asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> She came toward him, smiling calmly. He could see her a bit better now. She was young, maybe twenty-five standard years at most. Her eyes were set a bit wide apart, and a trifle glassy. Her gaze seemed to be a bit off-kilter, as if she were almost, but not quite, cross-eyed. She was looking right at Han, and yet he had the distinct impression that she was looking over his shoulder, into the middle distance&#x2014;or into the next galaxy over. Her jet-black hair was done up in an elaborate braid that was coiled on top of her head.<br> &nbsp;<br> She walked toward him with an easy confidence that seemed to brook no discussion. &#x201c;Glad to meet you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You can call me Kalenda.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Han said. &#x201c;I can call you Kalenda. So what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So I have a job for you,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> That brought Han up short. A job? He was about to reply with some sort of flip remark, but then he stopped. That didn&#x2019;t make sense. She obviously knew who Han was&#x2014;which was not much of an accomplishment, as Han and Leia and Luke were famous throughout the Republic. But if she knew who he was, she would have to know he was no longer available for casual hire. Something wasn&#x2019;t right. &#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; Han said, careful to keep his voice neutral.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kalenda shifted that strange gaze of hers so she was looking almost, but not quite, in the direction of Chewbacca. &#x201c;Perhaps we should talk alone,&#x201d; she said quietly.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was a low growl from Chewie, and Han did not even bother to glance over his shoulder at the Wookiee. He knew what he would see. Let Kalenda get a look at Chewie&#x2019;s fangs. &#x201c;Perhaps we shouldn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to hear anything you have to say that Chewbacca can&#x2019;t hear.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Very well,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But perhaps, at least, the three of us could talk in private?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Han said. &#x201c;Come on aboard the Falcon.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Kalenda frowned. Clearly, she didn&#x2019;t like that idea either. The Falcon was Han&#x2019;s turf. &#x201c;Very well,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Han gestured toward the ship with a sweep of his arm, and bowed very slightly, just enough to make it clear the gesture was sarcastic. &#x201c;Right this way,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> The probe droid hovered silently up into position, coming up over the wall of the hard stand area, then dropping in behind packing cases to keep out of sight. It was painted matte black, and was all but invisible in the deepening shadows. It watched the two humans and the Wookiee head up into the ship.<br> &nbsp;<br> It extended an audio monitor probe and aimed it at the Millennium Falcon. After a moment&#x2019;s hesitation, it moved in closer to the ship. Doing so exposed it to a greater risk of detection, but the probe droid&#x2019;s masters had programmed it to place a high priority on eavesdropping on just this sort of meeting. The droid decided it would be worth the risk if its masters were able to get a good recording of the conversation that was about to happen.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Coyote Medicine: Lessons from Native American Healing</h2><p>Hailed by Dr. Andrew Weil as a book &#x201c;that must be brought to all who seek true health,&#x201d; <i>Coyote Medicine</i> is an engaging and essential testament to the power of alternative healing and recovery methods that lie beyond the confines of Western medicine.<br><br>Inspired by his Cherokee grandmother's healing ceremonies, Lewis Mehl-Madrona enlightens readers to "alternative" paths to recovery and health. <i>Coyote Medicine</i> isn't about eschewing Western medicine when it's effective, but about finding other answers when medicine fails: for chronic sufferers, patients not responding to medication, or "terminal" cases that doctors have given up on.

Simon</b> is a screen and television writer and bestselling author.<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><br><b>Why Are You Here?</b><br><br>I started medical school expecting to become a research scientist. While still in college, I had joined a professor in his efforts to study biological membranes using a then-new technique called magnetic resonance imaging (now referred to by its acronym, MRI). As a member of his research team, I was named as a co-author of a paper he published on the work, and I imagine my acceptance into Stanford in the early 1970s was based partly on my participation in this new line of research. Indeed, I soon found a professor in my new California home with whom I intended to continue these studies. What I never expected was to become a clinician, focused less on research than on seeing patients.<br><br>At Stanford I actually started clinical work immediately. I had pushed myself to finish high school before turning sixteen, and as an undergraduate at Indiana University I had persuaded professors to let me take medical and graduate school biochemistry courses. These gave me advanced standing when I entered Stanford at age eighteen. As long as I took a necessary pharmacology course concurrently, I was ready to start seeing patients on clinical rotations. I was on track to finish medical school in June of 1975, with the required nine-quarter minimum. A decade later I learned I was Stanford's youngest ever peacetime graduate, at twenty-one years of age.<br><br>The challenging part for me was not in learning about pharmacology and anatomy but in understanding other doctors. There were numbing lists to memorize, of course, of nerves, muscles, bones, blood vessels, symptoms, diseases, drugs, and side effects; but compared with the knottier puzzles of philosophy or higher mathematics, nothing taught was all that difficult. There was plenty to memorize, but all memorization takes is time. The problem for me was that my interpersonal skills had languished in my race through high school and college. Thankfully, I had a new wife to coach me in the car on the way to dinner parties and social events. Professionally, though, I was on my own.<br><br>Medical students on clinical rotations were expected to examine patients and entertain a diagnosis. We would discuss our potential diagnoses, and the treatments and medications they implied, with the faculty physician. The challenge was to show that we had considered every possible diagnosis and had either ruled it out or planned the necessary tests to confirm or disconfirm its existence. Although most patients suffer from common diseases, we relished considering all the outlandish possibilities. First prize went to those who, in the end, turned in exactly the diagnosis our faculty physician had already reached -- we had to learn his or her style and mimic it. At nineteen, much to my own detriment, I was still young enough to be idealistic. I thought it was more important to think for myself than to try to think like someone else.<br><br>I also thought other doctors shared my own ideal of medicine: that its purpose was to restore unwell persons to health. Imagine my surprise on hearing a renowned professor of internal medicine begin a lecture by noting that the physician's job lay in "slowing and making less painful the patient's inexorable and inevitable progression toward death and decay."<br><br>Despite this my first rotation -- three months in neurosurgery -- was challenging and rewarding. I had already done work in college on the neural functions of rats. I was studying a particular brain rhythm, hoping to show that a molecule called serotonin triggered it. To do this, I implanted electrodes into rats' brains, then measured what happened when I introduced serotonin to different sites of their limbic systems. If the rhythm was produced by the serotonin, I would have strong evidence that serotonin was a neurotransmitter -- a message sent by a nerve to the cells in the vicinity. Neurotransmitter molecules are the only verbs a nerve has at its command; which molecules are produced, and how many, determine a message's content. At the time, scientists were certain of only two neurotransmitters; we have since identified twenty-six. These few molecules and the simple messages they carry from one to another of our three billion brain cells are the vital chemistry behind human thought.<br><br>Although this wasn't the concern at the outset, neurotransmitter research eventually had the practical yield of all sorts of drugs. Now we know, for instance, that serotonin depletion often accompanies depression. Drugs that increase the availability of serotonin, like Prozac, are common treatments for depression. Prozac, which belongs to a class of drugs known as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, works by blocking the enzymes that cause serotonin to be reabsorbed.<br><br>I found that rat brains produced the theta rhythm I was interested in when serotonin was introduced to certain sites "upstream" of the hippocampus -- which, in plain language, meant that serotonin was indeed a neurotransmitter, at least for rats. This was a publishable result. With my professor's advice and assistance, I finished my first solo paper and published it in a neurosurgery journal. I was very proud to become a part of a centuries-old tradition of expanding the known limits of scientific knowledge.<br><br>Since I already loved research, it was no surprise to find the data-gathering aspect of the neurosurgery rotation appealing. But I was unprepared to find how much I enjoyed simply working with people, practicing clinical medicine. Even if I was still more comfortable in a lab than on a ward, two months into the rotation I was starting to consider a career that wasn't pure research but combined research with clinical work. Perhaps I would become a pediatric neurosurgeon. Three months later I was on my second rotation, in urology, about to meet the four very sick men who would challenge my career plans even more profoundly.<br><br>It was a foggy April morning outside the renal room of the Intensive Care Unit at San Mateo County Medical Center (SMCMC), a major teaching hospital of Stanford University. A nurse introduced me in a perfunctory manner to the first three of the four men inside. There was little hope for them. The fourth man -- whom I will call Juan Martinez -- had a chance to survive. He was a forty-two-year-old carpenter from Los Gatos, in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. He had lost one of his kidneys in a San Jose hospital. After the operation, his remaining kidney had stopped working. When Seï¿½or Martinez's twenty-three-year-old daughter offered him one of her healthy kidneys, he had been transferred to SMCMC's renal room to be evaluated for a transplant.<br><br>My job was to begin a pre-transplant evaluation of Sr. Martinez to decide if there was any reason not to proceed with the surgery. I wondered what had happened to the man before he lost his kidney -- what had brought him here. I started by asking when he had last been well. We had to speak up to be heard over the bustling doctors, the efficient nurses, the constant drone of the voice of the paging operator (these were the days before beepers). Only his three drugged roommates were quiet.<br><br>The carpenter was lying on his back, holding himself perfectly still, looking more like a quadriplegic than a dialysis patient. His face had the texture of an onion skin. His muscled arms lay uselessly on the sheets. He took longer to answer than I expected; he seemed to be searching for an answer to a question much bigger than mine. Finally he said, "I was never sick."<br><br>"What do you mean?" I asked. He was avoiding looking at me, focusing instead on the grains in the ceiling panels overhead.<br><br>"There was nothing wrong with me," Sr. Martinez said flatly. His usually dark Hispanic complexion was blushing ocher, and he began to cry quietly. His jaw continued working after he spoke, as if there were more to say but no words with which to say it. I glanced out the window. The morning's fog had dissolved into a light rain, unusual weather for April in San Mateo. Water ran slowly in crazy currents down the window panes. I found myself shivering.<br><br>"What do you mean, there was nothing wrong with you?" I asked when it was clear that the carpenter wasn't going to go on. He was clutching the bedsheet.<br><br>"They said I had protein in my urine -- but I didn't feel bad or nothing," the man said without emotion. His face was expressionless except for the silent tears in the corners of his eyes.<br><br>"And then?"<br><br>"They ran some tests. Then more tests. They took a biopsy of my kidney, and I got this infection that almost killed me." The man gazed down the length of his sheet-covered body. "It did kill my kidneys," he said. His jaw stopped working and his lips began to quiver. Our conference was interrupted by an officious nurse who had come to change his IV. Feeling worried and confused about what had happened to her charge, I left her to the task.<br><br>Later that morning I read his chart in the conference room behind the nurses' station. Just a few months earlier, he had been framing houses in the canyons outside San Jose. On weekends he went hunting and fishing in the northern California wilderness. His doctor had discovered the traces of protein in his urine during a routine insurance physical. Proteinuria can be a normal enough finding in a person who has been exercising strenuously, but it can also be an early sign of serious kidney ailments and autoimmune diseases.<br><br>Although Sr. Martinez had no symptoms of any of these problems, his internist ordered a full workup. A series of ordinarily innocuous medical procedures had led, for Martinez, to the worst possible complications. After his doctors biopsied a kidney, Martinez got an infection, then began to hemorrhage. His doctors repaired that damage by removing the injured left kidney; Martinez's right kidney responded by shutting down. He developed sepsis, an infection of the blood that can spread anywhere in the body. Doctors at SMCMC managed to clear up the infection but couldn't get the right kidney working again. Martinez's best hope now was a new kidney. As for the biopsy that had kicked off the whole process, it had been inconclusive. Nobody had any idea why Martinez had once had traces of protein in his urine, and now nobody was trying to find out. That problem -- if it had ever been a problem -- no longer seemed important.<br><br>I sat in the conference room looking out the hospital's narrow windows at the rain and thinking about the man in the room on the other side of the nurses' station. His old charts and records were heaped on the table before me. I thought of the dark forests of northern California, where Sr. Martinez had hunted, of the deep lakes the forests held, of the ancient trails that led up past the timberline into a world of rock and ice and snow -- a world Juan Martinez might never see again. Then I reread his chart, hoping for some clue to his predicament.<br><br>I was still searching when a resident in urology, Musaf Habra, walked in and set two Styrofoam cups of tea on the table. Dr. Habra was a Saudi general practitioner who wanted to teach at the Saudi Medical Center in Riyadh after he finished training as a urologist at SMCMC He was the sort of gentle man whose constitutional kindness can be mistaken for weakness. He had won my admiration at a recent party, where he played the violin with a sensitivity that was anything but weak.<br><br>"Reviewing Seï¿½or Martinez's case?" he asked, nodding at the charts on the table.<br><br>"Trying to make sense of it," I said.<br><br>"Sense?" Dr. Habra gave me a quizzical look. "What 'sense' are you looking for?"<br><br>"I'm not sure," I said. "The logic behind the biopsy, I suppose. I'm trying to understand how this could have happened."<br><br>He shrugged and pushed one of the cups of tea toward me. "His doctor wanted to know what was causing his proteinuria," Habra said in a matter-of-fact tone that served to mask what he thought about the whole thing.<br><br>"But he says he wasn't sick," I countered. "And I can't find anything in his chart that indicates any other symptoms or diseases."<br><br>"He didn't have symptoms. He had proteinuria..." Habra thought a moment and lowered his already quiet voice. "And he had the 'advantage' of the best preventive health care in the world."<br><br>"You wouldn't have biopsied him in Saudi Arabia?"<br><br><i>"I</i> wouldn't have biopsied him <i>here,"</i> Habra replied. He raised his eyebrows. "But you Americans are so much more advanced than we Saudi." He winked. "Wanting to know the answers to everything can be deadly." He parodied his own accent a little, lending it a playful hint of intrigue.<br><br>I agreed with Habra's critique but was hurt to be included by him among "you Americans." Of course I was one, but I didn't identify at all with the culture that lay behind the unnecessary renal biopsy that had destroyed the carpenter's health. I wanted Habra to see me as something more than just another American. I was a <i>Native</i> American, for one thing, and I hoped that somehow made me different.<br><br>It seemed to me my medical student friends and I were more like Habra than he knew. A small group of us were naturally drawn together -- Native Americans, Hispanics, and Asians -- because we all had different cultural perspectives from those prevalent at Stanford. Though we didn't have strong social ties, we did hang out together in school. It took the edge off our feeling of not belonging. Some of my fellows had come to Stanford straight from their reservations and found themselves in an entirely new, often incomprehensible culture. Spurred by my new friendships, I began to reconsider my own Native American heritage, which my mother had long ago turned her back on.<br><br>While I was thinking about what Dr. Habra had said, David Vickory breezed into the conference room. Dr. Vickory was a decisive, energetic man with an encyclopedic knowledge of kidneys. In his late thirties, Vickory was juggling two ambitious careers, running a busy research lab and simultaneously winning a reputation as one of the best nephrologist -- kidney specialists -- in the country.<br><br>"Well, boys," he said, rubbing his hands together as if they were cold, "what do you think of my man, Martinez -- is he a good candidate for transplant, or what?"<br><br>Dr. Habra thought for a moment. "There is the matter of his infection --" he started.<br><br>"We've licked the infection," Dr. Vickory interjected. "His fever has long since lifted. He's ready for the knife. Unless..." He turned a chair backward and straddled it. "Unless you've found something I missed." His tone was challenging. He waited barely an instant and turned toward me. "You look troubled, Dr." -- he glanced at my name tag -- "Mehl. Did <i>you</i> find something I missed?<br><br>"I told him I hadn't.<br><br>"And yet," he continued in his light, teasing tone, "you do look troubled. Our man is stable. We've cleared his infection. We've got a kidney standing by. And still something worries you."<br><br>"Actually," I said slowly, "I'm struggling to understand how he got here in the first place."<br><br>Vickory's face went blank for a moment, and his cheerful demeanor vanished. "You have a question about how patients get infections?"<br><br>On one level, it would be a ridiculous question for a medical student to ask: even premeds know that microbes cause infection. But on another level, the question was worth pondering. Why did this particular patient succumb to microbes when most others do not? The first question would be too basic and the second too philosophical to warrant discussion in the urology conference room. Vickory was trying to figure out which of these transgressions I had made.<br><br>I saved him the trouble. "Of course I know what causes infection. I was wondering w...</p><h2>Versailles: A Biography of a Palace</h2><p><p>Called "fast-paced" (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>) and "highly engrossing" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>), this is the behind-the-scenes story of the world's most famous palace.</p><p>The story of Versailles is one of high historical drama mixed with the high camp and glamour of the European courts, all in an iconic home for the French arts. The palace itself has been radically altered since 1789. <i>Versailles</i> sets out to rediscover what is now a vanished world: a great center of power and, for thousands, a home both grand and squalid.</p><p>Using the latest historical research, Spawforth offers the first full account of Versailles in English in over thirty years. He probes the conventional picture of this "perpetual house party" and gives full weight to the darker side: not just the mounting discomfort of the aging palace but also the intrigue and status anxiety of its aristocrats, as well as the changing place of Versailles in France's national identity since 1789.</p><p>Many books have told the stories of the royals and artists living in Versailles, but this is the first to turn its focus on the palace itself&#x2015;from architecture to politics to scandal to restoration.</p></p><p><p>As well as having a rich broadcast history, TONY SPAWFORTH is the author and editor of numerous books on the ancient world. He is currently professor of ancient history at Newcastle University in England.</p>Starred Review. This fascinating, immensely readable book will be welcomed by both general readers and those interested in French culture. Using an impressive array of sources, Spawforth (ancient history, Newcastle Univ.; <i>The Complete Greek Temples</i>) re-creates the history of Versailles and its inhabitants, focusing not merely on architectural details but on the many human stories hidden within its lengthy past. Meticulously tracing the growth and changing usages of the palace from the days of Louis XIII to the ill-fated departure of Louis XVI in the upheaval of the Revolution, he offers vivid insights into a vanished world of royal and aristocratic splendor as he describes the clothing, rituals, habits, ceremonies, and entertainments of a social set obsessed with the "fetishes of rank." No detail appears to have escaped his purview as he looks at the court's dress codes, standards of service, etiquette rituals, and sanitary facilities. Even more important are the glimpses he provides into the lives of those servants and townspeople who made life at Versailles possible, individuals such as the "water waiter" who oversaw a kind of underground economy by redistributing leftovers from royal tables. This book thoughtfully analyzes how Versailles has been both a living community and a symbol of many things&#x2014;royal magnificence, despotism, extravagance, isolation, and, finally, national pride. Most intriguing is the little-known story of what became of Versailles after the Revolution and the key role played by conservators like Pierre de Nolhac in preserving and reconstructing its history.

She was being a shameless voyeur, peeping around the corner of the brownstone to watch a crowd of people that, unlike her, had time to have a life, and were talking and laughing out on the sidewalk in front of the nightclub across the street.<br><br> For the past few minutes she&#x2019;d been riveted by a leggy redhead and her boyfriend&#x2014;a dark-haired, sun-bronzed, muscled hottie in jeans and a white T-shirt. He kept backing his girlfriend up against the wall, stretching her hands above her head, and kissing her like there was no tomorrow, getting into it with his whole gorgeous, rippling body. (And would you just look at that hip action? The way he was grinding against her&#x2014;they might as well be doing it right there in the street!)<br><br> Jessi sucked in a sharp breath.<br><br> God, had she ever been kissed like that? Like the man couldn&#x2019;t wait to get inside her? Like he wanted to devour her, maybe crawl right inside her skin?<br><br> The redhead&#x2019;s hands slipped free, down to the hottie&#x2019;s ass, fingers curving into his muscled butt, and Jessi&#x2019;s hands curled into fists.<br><br> When the hottie&#x2019;s hands skimmed up the redhead&#x2019;s breasts, his thumbs braising her nipples, Jessi&#x2019;s own went hard as little pearls. She could almost imagine she was the one he was kissing, that she was the one he was about to have hot, animalistic&#x2014;<br><br> Why can&#x2019;t I have a life like that? she thought.<br><br> You can, an inner voice reminded&#x2014;after your PhD.<br><br> The reminder wasn&#x2019;t nearly as effective as it had been years ago as an undergrad. She was sick of being in school, sick of being broke, sick of constantly racing from her classes to her full-time job as Professor Keene&#x2019;s assistant, then home to study, or if she was really lucky, snatching a whopping four or five hours of sleep before getting up to do it all over again.<br><br> Her demanding, tightly organized schedule left no time for a social life. And lately she&#x2019;d been feeling downright sulky about it. Everywhere she turned lately there were couples, and they were busy coupling and having a wonderfully couplelicious time of it.<br><br> But not her. There was no time for coupling in her life. She wasn&#x2019;t one of the lucky ones that had a free ride through school. She had to scrimp and save and make every moment and penny count. In addition to working full-time and taking a full load of classes, she taught classes too. It barely left her time to eat, shower, and sleep.<br><br> On the infrequent occasions she&#x2019;d tried to date, the guys had gotten so fed up with how seldom she could see them and how low on her list of priorities they seemed to be and how unwilling she was to fall right in bed with them (most college guys seemed to think if they didn&#x2019;t score by the third date there was something wrong with the woman&#x2014;puh-leeze), that they&#x2019;d soon sought greener pastures.<br><br> Still, it would all be worth it soon. Although some people didn&#x2019;t seem to think being an archaeologist and playing with old, dusty, or, frequently, dead things for the rest of one&#x2019;s life was a particularly exciting thing to do (like her mom, who hated Jessi&#x2019;s choice of major and couldn&#x2019;t understand why she wasn&#x2019;t married and blissfully popping out babies like her sisters), Jessi couldn&#x2019;t imagine a more thrilling career. It might not top other people&#x2019;s lists of dreams, but it was hers.<br><br> Dr. Jessica St. James. She was so close she could taste it. Another year and a half and she&#x2019;d be done with her course work for her PhD.<br><br> Then she might date like the Energizer Bunny, making up for lost time. But right now, she&#x2019;d not worked so hard and gone into so much debt to go screwing everything up just because she seemed to be stuck in some kind of hormonal overdrive.<br><br> In a few years, she consoled herself, staring down at the busy street, the people hanging out at that club would probably still be hanging out at that club, their lives completely unchanged, while she would be traveling to far-off places, digging up remnants of the past, and having grand adventures.<br><br> And who knew, maybe Mr. Right would be waiting for her out there at some future dig site. Maybe her life just wasn&#x2019;t scheduled to take off as fast as everyone else&#x2019;s. Maybe she was just a late bloomer.<br><br> Holy cow&#x2014;the hottie was slipping his hand inside the redhead&#x2019;s jeans. And her hand was on his&#x2014;oh! Right there in front of God and everybody!<br><br> Behind her, somewhere in the cramped and crowded apartment that desperately needed to be cleaned and have the trash taken out, the phone began to ring.<br><br> Jessi rolled her eyes. The mundaneness of her existence always chose the most inconvenient moments to intrude.<br><br> Ring! Ring!<br><br> She gulped another fascinated look at the unabashed display of sex-on-the-sidewalk, then reluctantly boosted herself inside the kitchen window. She shook her head in a vain attempt to clear it, then pulled down the shade. What she couldn&#x2019;t see, couldn&#x2019;t torture her. At least not much, anyway.<br><br> Riiiiing!<br><br> Where was that blasted phone?<br><br> She finally spied it on the sofa, nearly buried beneath pillows, candy wrappers, and a pizza box that contained&#x2014;eew&#x2014;something fuzzy and phosphorescent green. As she gingerly pushed aside the box, she hesitated, hand suspended in midair above the phone.<br><br> For a moment&#x2014;the briefest, most peculiar of interludes&#x2014;she suffered the inexplicable, intense feeling that she shouldn&#x2019;t pick it up.<br><br> That she should just let it ring and ring.<br><br> Maybe let it ring all weekend.<br><br> Later, Jessi would recall that feeling.<br><br> Time itself seemed to stand still for that odd, pregnant slice of time, and she had the weirdest sensation that the universe itself had stopped breathing and was waiting to see what she would do next.<br><br> She wrinkled her nose at the ridiculous, egocentric thought.<br><br> As if the universe ever even noticed Jessi St. James.<br><br> She picked up the phone.<br><br> Lucan Myrddin Trevayne paced before the fire.<br><br> When employing a sorcerer&#x2019;s spell to conceal his true appearance&#x2014;which he did whenever he wasn&#x2019;t completely alone&#x2014;he was tall, in his early forties, handsome, powerfully built, his thick black hair dashed at the temples with silver. He was a man who turned women&#x2019;s heads, and made men take an instinctive step back when he walked by. His mien said one thing: Power&#x2014;I have it, you don&#x2019;t. And if you think you do&#x2014;try me. His features were Old World, his eyes cold gray as a loch beneath a stormy sky. His true appearance was far less appealing.<br><br> He&#x2019;d amassed tremendous wealth and power in his lifetime, which had been considerably longer than most. He held controlling interest in many and varied enterprises, from banks to media to oil. He kept residences in a dozen cities. He retained a select group of uniquely trained men and the occasional woman to handle his most private affairs.<br><br> To his left, seated in a deep armchair, one of those men waited tensely.<br><br> &#x201c;This is absurd, Roman,&#x201d; Lucan growled. &#x201c;What the hell&#x2019;s taking so long?&#x201d;<br><br> Roman shifted defensively in his chair. He was aptly named, his features as classically handsome as those on an ancient coin, his hair long and blond. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got men on it, Mr. Trevayne,&#x201d; he said with the trace of a Russian accent. &#x201c;The best men we&#x2019;ve got. The problem is, they went in a dozen different directions. They were sold on the black market. No one has names. It&#x2019;s going to take time&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Time is the one thing I don&#x2019;t have,&#x201d; Lucan cut him off sharply. &#x201c;Every hour, every moment that passes, makes it less likely they&#x2019;ll be recovered. Those damned things must be found.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Those damned things&#x201d; were the Dark or &#x201c;Unseelie&#x201d; Hallows of the Tuatha Dï¿½ Danaan&#x2014;artifacts of immense power created by an ancient civilization that had passed, centuries ago and quite erroneously, into Man&#x2019;s history books as a mythical race: the Daoine Sidhe or the Fae.<br><br> Lucan had believed there was no better place to safekeep his prized treasures than in his well-warded private residence in London.<br><br> He&#x2019;d been wrong.<br><br> Critically wrong.<br><br> He wasn&#x2019;t certain what had happened a few months ago while he&#x2019;d been out of the country pursuing a lead on the Dark Book, the final and most powerful of the four Unseelie Hallows, but something had transpired somewhere in London&#x2014;its epicenter in the east side, he could feel the lingering traces of power&#x2014;that had reverberated through all of England. An immense and ancient power had risen for a brief time, so strong that it had neutralized all other magic in Britain.<br><br> Which he wouldn&#x2019;t have cared about since whatever it was had departed as swiftly as it had come, except for the fact that its rising had shattered formidable, allegedly unbreakable wards that protected his most prized possessions. Protected them so well that he&#x2019;d found the notion of a modern-day security system laughable.<br><br> Not so laughable now.<br><br> He&#x2019;d had a state-of-the-art system installed, with cameras in every room, sweeping every angle, because while he&#x2019;d been away, a thief had broken into his museum of a home and stolen artifacts that had belonged to him for centuries&#x2014;including his irreplaceable Hallows: the box, amulet, and mirror.<br><br> Fortunately the thief had been spotted by neighbors while hauling away his loot. Unfortunately, by the time Lucan&#x2019;s select staff had managed to identify and track the bastard, he&#x2019;d already sold the artifacts to the first in a series of elusive middlemen.<br><br> Artifacts such as his, fabulous and utterly lacking provenance, inevitably ended up in one of two places: with the legal authorities of one country or another after being intercepted in transit, or sold for a fraction of their worth on the black market before disappearing, sometimes for hundreds of years before so much as a whispered rumor was heard of them again. They&#x2019;d gotten few names&#x2014;and those, obvious aliases&#x2014;from the thief before he&#x2019;d died. For months now, Lucan&#x2019;s men had been chasing a deliberately and cunningly muddied trail. And time was growing critical.<br><br> &#x201c;. . . though we&#x2019;ve recovered three of the manuscripts and one of the swords, we&#x2019;ve learned nothing about the box or amulet. But it looks like we might have a solid lead on the mirror,&#x201d; Roman was saying.<br><br> Lucan stiffened. The mirror. The Dark Glass was the one Hallow he needed urgently. Of all the years it might have been stolen, it&#x2019;d had to be this one, when the tithe was due! The other Dark Hallows could wait a bit longer, though not long; they were far too dangerous to have loose in the world. Each of the Hallows conferred a gift upon its possessor for a price, if the possessor had the knowledge and the power to use it. The mirror&#x2019;s Dark Gift was immortality, so long as he met its conditions. He&#x2019;d been meeting its conditions for over a thousand years now. He intended to continue.<br><br> &#x201c;A shipment rumored to fit the bill left England for the States via Ireland a few days ago. We believe it&#x2019;s headed for some university in Chicago, to a&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then why the fuck are you still sitting here?&#x201d; Lucan said coldly. &#x201c;If you have a lead, any lead at all on the glass, I want you on it personally. Now.&#x201d; It was imperative he recover the mirror before Samhain. Or else.<br><br> That &#x201c;or else&#x201d; was a thing he refused to contemplate. The mirror would be found, the tithe paid; a small quantity of pure gold passed through the glass every one hundred years&#x2014;in the Old Ones way of marking time, which was more than a century by modern standards, at precisely midnight on Samhain, or Halloween as the current century called it. Twenty-six days from today the century&#x2019;s tithe was due. Twenty-six days from today the mirror must be in his possession&#x2014;or The Compact binding his captive to it would be broken.<br><br> As the blond man gathered his coat and gloves, Lucan reiterated his position where the Dark Hallows were concerned. &#x201c;No witnesses, Roman. Anyone who&#x2019;s caught so much as even a glimpse of one of the Hallows . . .&#x201d;<br><br> Roman inclined his head in silent concurrence.<br><br> Lucan said no more. There was no need. Roman knew how he liked things handled, as did all who worked for him and continued to live.<br><br> Some time later, shortly after midnight, Jessi was back on campus for the third time that day, in the south wing of the Archaeology Department, unlocking Professor Keene&#x2019;s office.<br><br> She wondered wryly why she even bothered leaving. Given the hours she kept, she&#x2019;d be better off tucking a cot into that stuffy, forgotten janitor&#x2019;s closet down the hall, amid mops and brooms and pails that hadn&#x2019;t been used in years. She&#x2019;d not only get more sleep, she&#x2019;d save on gas money too.<br><br> When the professor had called her from the hospital to tell her that he&#x2019;d been in a &#x201c;bit of a fender bender&#x201d; on his way back to campus&#x2014;&#x201c;a few inconvenient fractures and contusions, not to worry,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d assured her swiftly&#x2014;she&#x2019;d been expecting him to ask her to pick up his classes for the next few days (meaning her sleep window would dwindle from four or five hours to a great, big, fat nil), but he&#x2019;d informed her he&#x2019;d already called Mark Troudeau and arranged for him to take his classes until he returned.<br><br> I&#x2019;ve a wee favor to ask of you, though, Jessica. I&#x2019;ve a package coming. I was to accept a delivery at my office this evening, he&#x2019;d told her in his deep voice that, even after twenty-five years away from County Louth, Ireland, had never lost its lilt.<br><br> She loved that lilt. Couldn&#x2019;t wait to one day hear a whole pub speaking it while she washed down a hearty serving of soda bread and Irish stew with a perfectly poured Guinness. After, of course, having spent an entire day in the National Museum of Ireland delightedly poring over such fabulous treasures as the Tara Brooch, the Ardagh Chalice, and the Broighter Gold Collection.<br><br> Hugging the phone between ear and shoulder, she&#x2019;d glanced at her watch, the luminous dial indicating ten minutes past ten. What kind of package gets delivered so late at night? she&#x2019;d wondered aloud.<br><br> You needn&#x2019;t concern yourself with that. Just sign for it, lock it up, and go home. That&#x2019;s all I need.<br><br> Of course, Professor, but what&#x2014;<br><br> Just sign, lock it up, and forget about it, Jessica. A pause, a weighty silence, then: I see no reason to mention this to anyone. It&#x2019;s personal. Not university business.<br><br> She&#x2019;d blinked, startled; she&#x2019;d never heard such a tone in the professor&#x2019;s voice before. Words sharply clipped, he&#x2019;d sounded defensive, almost . . . well, paranoid.<br><br> I understand I&#x2019;ll take care of it. You just rest, Professor. Don&#x2019;t you worry about a thing, she&#x2019;d soothed hastily, deciding that whatever pain meds he was getting were making him funny, the poor dear. She&#x2019;d once had Tylenol with codeine that had made her feel itchy all over, short-tempered and irritable. With multiple fractures, it was a sure bet he&#x2019;d been given something stronger than Tylenol 3.<br><br> Now, standing beneath the faintly buzzing fluorescent lights in the university hallway, she rubbed her eyes and yawned hugely. She was exhausted. She&#x2019;d gotten up at six-fifteen for a seven-twenty class and by the time she got home tonight&#x2014;er, this morning&#x2014;and managed to fall back into bed, she would have put in another twenty-hour day.

Yet in his Rule, Benedict comes across more as a practical community organizer and premier spiritual father. In this volume, Terrence Kardong offers a fresh take on Gregory the Great's classic. He alternates between translated sections of the Diablo's and his own commentary. Crisp and direct, and infused with his wry and ever-present sense of humor, Kardong's writings sure to build up the spiritual life of readers and, equally important, to make them love St. Benedict.</p><i>.</i></p><p><p>Terrence G. Kardong, OSB, is a monk of Assumption Abbey, Richardton, North Dakota. He has been editor of&nbsp;<i>The American Benedictine Review</i>&nbsp;since 1982 and has written many books and articles, including <i>Benedict&#x2019;s Rule: A Translation and Commentary </i>and <i>Benedict Backwards</i>, both published by Liturgical Press.</p>This translation and commentary will be a valuable resource for educators seeking to introduce undergraduates to the development of monasticism and hagiography.Religious Studies Review<br><br>The book is written with great affection for the character St. Benedict both historically and as he appears in the Life. Moreover, Kardong provides insight into how Benedict is seen through Gregory&#x2019;s admiring eyes. For these reasons and because of the helpful line-by-line explication, the work may be helpful to both scholars and beginning students in the Benedictine studies, history, literature, and theology. Because the commentary so fully fills in the background and contextual picture surrounding the text, Kardong&#x2019;s book would also be of benefit to a general audience interested in deepening knowledge of St. Benedict and the traditions surrounding his life.Catholic Studies<br><br>This is a useful tool to instruct anyone interested in Benedictine life.

Especially for those in monastic formation, oblate formation, or monastic studies courses, it is a user-friendly volume that is compact and attractive.Cistercian Studies Quarterly<br><br>In Terrence Kardong&#x2019;s many contributions to the explication of and commentary on St. Benedict's Rule, we have always found the sharp and well worded wisdom that opens the Rule and the human heart to the truth of each other. That same sharp wisdom and clear perception of humanity is now brought to Gregory the Great&#x2019;s life of St. Benedict. &#x2018;Our contention throughout this commentary,&#x2019; Kardong says, &#x2018;is that these stories are &#x201c;true&#x201d; even if they never happened.&#x2019; Kardong's commentary goes deeper than what the stories say to reveal Gregory's intent to bring the reader to love Benedict and Gregory's skill in shaping each narrative and the overall narrative to give the reader a sense of continuity. And there is large truth here&#x2014;the truth of Christ, of Benedict, of human persons and humanity.Sister Shawn Carruth, OSB<br><br>Entering into the spirit of the Dialogues, Fr. Terrence offers us a lucid translation and a sensible commentary that explores the meaning of this spiritual classic.

The commentary is interspersed throughout the book, following sections he has just translated. The net effect of this methodology is to create a much more rounded, continuous biography, rather than simply proceeding from Gregory&#x2019;s rather sketchy and sometimes dubious rendition. The author balances Gregory&#x2019;s Benedict with what we know from current scholarship. Father Terrence, master of the anecdote, displays once again his uncanny ability to express the profound with elegant simplicity. He has been able in this book to interweave the credible from Gregory with the believable of Benedict, as he reveals himself in his own Rule. The result, as always from Terrence&#x2019;s pen, is both readable and reliable, as well as entertaining and enjoyable.Fr.

Kardong presents a calm perspective on the debate about Gregory's authorship of Dialogues II.

Jon Spoelstra, who pushed sponsorship and fan revenue to unprecedented heights for the lowly New Jersey Nets basketball franchise, shows how to put big-league marketing expertise to use off the court in <i>Ice to the Eskimos: How To Market a Product Nobody Wants.</i> His 19 "jump-start ground rules," sprinkled liberally with sports anecdotes, are designed to apply to any product or service.The New Jersey Nets ranked 27th in a universe of 27 teams; their gate receipts were the lowest in the NBA; and the hometown fans, if they came to games at all, were as likely to root for the visitors as for the Nets. They couldn't get Michael Jordan or Shaquille O'Neal. So the Nets drafted Jon Spoelstra. And things at the Meadowlands Arena suddenly started to look up. <p> Jon Spoelstra, the top-rated marketer of professional sports teams today, reveals how he jump-started the Nets in <b>Ice to the Eskimos: How to Successfully Market a Product Nobody Wants</b> (HarperBusiness; June 18, 1997). His savvy marketing techniques increased attendance, corporate sponsorship, and the team's profits. Now, outlined in Spoelstra's book, they offer hope and solid help to anyone who has to sell a less-than-ideal product in less-than-ideal circumstances. </p><p> Faced with a product that had more negative than positive attributes - the Nets played terribly, the team members were hardly charismatic, and the ready-made market of geographic identity most teams enjoy had been pre-empted by the New York Knicks, just six miles away in Manhattan - Spoelstra took a radical approach. He not only eschewed marketing the Nets as a traditional home-town team, he shaped his initial campaign around their opponents. At the chronically undersold Meadowlands, it was easy to get tickets to see Michael Jordan, Shaq, Charles Barkley, and Patrick Ewing, and Spoelstra lost no time in trumpeting that fact. One other touch completed Spoelstra's master plan. In counterpoint to the fat-cat corporate atmosphere of Knicks' games at Madison Square Garden, he positioned Nets basketball as family entertainment and focused his marketing efforts on reaching the people, the "neighborhood" fans and their families while soliciting corporate sponsorship from carefully targeted local companies. </p><p> Like most marketers, Spoelstra could not improve the product itself, so he concentrated on what he knew best: creative marketing. Guided by two Golden Rules - "Only try to sell a product that the customer wants to buy" and "Try to sell the customer just a little bit more than what they want to buy" - he introduced innovations that resonated from the ticket-sales office to the once-sacrosanct ivory tower of top management. As he recounts his successes - in his four-and-a-half years with the Nets, only one of Spoelstra's ideas was rejected by the owners - he presents simple ground rules any business can adopt and provides helpful hints on carrying them out, including: </p><p> Use the "quick-fix silver bullet" approach. Increase the frequency of purchase by your own customers by approaching them on a one-to-one basis and addressing them with friendly, personalized messages rather than with costly brochures and overblown hype. </p><p> Keep up with the day-to-day details of sales. As president of the Nets, Spoelstra not only kept a close eye on sponsorship sales, the team's biggest source of income, he had face-to-face approval meetings for the hiring of every ticket-sales person, held annual "ticket sales boot camps" to re-enforce sales fundamentals, and attended twice-a-week sales meetings. </p><p> Make innovation a way of life and pay people for their mistakes. Most breakthrough ideas are born in the free exchange of suggestions for improving standard practices. By rewarding sales and marketing people even for ideas that may eventually fail, a company encourages better suggestions - and better chances for a plan, large or small, that will increase revenue. </p><p> Turn your client into a hero. In a whole new spin on the concept of selling, the people in charge of corporate sponsorship sales for the Nets provided an annual report for their clients (and their clients' bosses) that proved just how successful the sponsorship was. </p><p> Find out what the problem is and help fix it. This simple sentence comprises Spoelstra's ten-second policy manual, his essential rule for keeping the customers who make the greatest impact on the bottom line. </p><p> For Spoelstra, jump-start marketing requires the involvement and commitment of high ranking executives. He urges top management to abandon their ivory towers, give up their perks, meet their customers face-to-face, buy their own products or services and even answer their own phones. <b>Ice to the Eskimos</b> proves just how much fun - and how profitable - Spoelstra's hands-on, innovative methods can be. </p><p> <b>ABOUT THE AUTHOR: </b> </p><p> Widely acknowledged to be the best pro-sports marketer in the country, Jon Spoelstra spent eleven years as the general manager of the Portland Trail Blazers before he became president of the New Jersey Nets.

A wide variety of exercises, reflections, and vocabulary enrichment tasks accompany each myth. Students preparing for the ACL Medusa Myth Exam and the ACL National Mythology Exam will find in this an indispensable tool. Creation myths, stories of the Olympians and Titans, legends of the Trojan War cycle, love stories and tales of transformation are all included here. A teacher resource section provides historical, archaeological, artistic and psychological background, ideas for further research and exploration, as well as hands-on class activities. Special Features -based on primary Latin and Greek sources -a fresh retelling of the timeless tales from Classical Mythology -contains content exercises -English vocabulary words that are based on the myths are explained and accompanied by exercises -reflections upon the enduring quality of the myths are included There is currently no workbook on classical mythology and no book for pre-collegiate students that is based on primary sources.<p>Also available:</p><p>The Hero and the Sea: Patterns of Chaos in Ancient Myth - ISBN 0865165084<br>A Short Guide to Classical Mythology - ISBN 086516309X</p><p>For over 30 years Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers has produced the highest quality Latin and ancient Greek books. From Dr. Seuss books in Latin to Plato's <i>Apology</i>, Bolchazy-Carducci's titles help readers learn about ancient Rome and Greece; the Latin and ancient Greek languages are alive and well with titles like Cicero's <i>De Amicitia</i> and <i>Kaegi's Greek Grammar</i>. We also feature a line of contemporary eastern European and WWII books. </p><p> Some of the areas we publish in include: </p><p> Selections From The Aeneid<br> Latin Grammar &amp; Pronunciation<br> Greek Grammar &amp; Pronunciation<br> Texts Supporting Wheelock's Latin<br> Classical author workbooks: Vergil, Ovid, Horace, Catullus, Cicero<br> Vocabulary Cards For AP Selections: Vergil, Ovid, Catullus, Horace<br> Greek Mythology<br> Greek Lexicon<br> Slovak Culture And History</p></p><p>Most Latin teachers are constantly on the lookout to find ancillary materials to help them incorporate more mythological and cultural material into their classrooms, but many find it a challenge to teach these important contextual aspects as thoroughly as they would like. Most Latin teachers have multiple preps and sometimes even multi-level classes. It is not uncommon for a Latin teacher to teach additional subjects as well. Finding the time to create really good mythology and cultural units can be a serious problem.<p>Bolchazy-Carducci has just published a new workbook which will take an enormous burden off the shoulders of busy teachers. (It is really about time!) There is just no other resource out there that is as comprehensive and useful for junior and senior high students of Latin and the Classics.</p><p>Classical Mythology and More: A Reader Workbook, written by Marianthe Colakis and Mary Joan Masello, is an incredible ancillary resource for middle and high school Latin students. The authors have based their highly readable retellings on authentic primary sources, including Homer, Hesiod, Vergil, Ovid, and other Classical authors. The 19 chapters cover the Creation myths, the Muses, Olympian deities, adventures, love stories, hero tales, the houses of Atreus, Oedipus, Metamorphoses, the Trojans, Odysseus, Aeneas, and the Roman kings. Each chapter includes objective review exercises, "musings" intended to stimulate higher level thinking, word derivation studies, and interesting facts linking mythology to real life.</p><p>Students will appreciate the side-bar summaries, and I think they will also like the vintage black and white illustrations. Books do not have to be illustrated in color to have visual interest. Latin teachers who collect vintage school texts will certainly recognize both the side-bar concept and the line art taken from late 19th and early 20th century Latin and mythology books. The format and artwork seem very appropriate for the subject matter. To facilitate student learning, the appendices include a large number of genealogical charts, chapter-by-chapter glossaries, and a pronunciation guide. There is also a bibliography. A teacher's guide is available separately from the publisher.</p><p>Teachers can choose to follow the book in sequence or select chapters suitable for their students core Latin textbook. Some teachers may choose to have students work through the material independently, while others will probably want to have their classes work in small groups to complete the exercises and activities. The authors were mindful of teachers preparing students for national examinations, competitions, and certamina in writing this book. Parents who are basing their children's course of study on the Classical Homeschooling model and cultural literacy will no doubt find Classical Mythology and More invaluable.</p><p>I have a very minor criticism about their inclusion of websites related to the content, only because internet addresses change so often. The authors themselves admit their misgivings. Many textbook publishers now have companion websites for their materials, and I think that this book is a definite candidate for one, although I realize that it takes time and effort to keep such a website properly updated.</p><p>One word of warning: you might want to hide this book from the English and Language Arts department! They will probably want to use it too! --Sharon Kazmierski, The Clearing House, Classical Outlook</p></p><h2>A Secret Life: The Polish Officer, His Covert Mission, and the Price He Paid to Save His Country</h2><p>In August 1972, Ryszard Kuklinski, a highly respected colonel in the Polish Army, embarked on what would become one of the most extraordinary human intelligence operations of the Cold War. Despite the extreme risk to himself and his family, he contacted the American Embassy in Bonn, and arranged a secret meeting. From the very start, he made clear that he deplored the Soviet domination of Poland, and believed his country was on the wrong side of the Cold War.<br><br> Over the next nine years, Kuklinski&#x2014;code name "Jack Strong"&#x2014;rose quickly in the Polish defense ministry, acting as a liaison to Moscow, and helping to prepare for a "hot war" with the West. But he also lived a life of subterfuge--of dead drops, messages written in invisible ink, miniature cameras, and secret transmitters. In 1981, he gave the CIA the secret plans to crush Solidarity. Then, about to be discovered, he made a dangerous escape with his family to the West. He still lives in hiding in America.<br><br> Kuklinski's story is a harrowing personal drama about one man's decision to betray the Communist leadership in order to save the country he loves, and the intense debate it spurred over whether he was a traitor or a patriot. Through extensive interviews and access to the CIA's secret archive on the case, Benjamin Weiser offers an unprecedented and richly detailed look at this secret history of the Cold War.<br></p><p><b>Benjamin Weiser</b> has been a metropolitan reporter for the <i>New York Times</i> since 1997, where he has covered legal issues and terrorism. Before joining the <i>Times,</i> he spent eighteen years as reporter for the <i>Washington Post,</i> where he served on the investigative staff. His journalism has received the George Polk and Livingston awards.<br><p> During the Cold War, the West had only rare glimpses of the men calling the shots behind the Iron Curtain, and most of the time we saw two-dimensional images of gray, emotionless bureaucrats, seated impassively at U.N. meetings or imperiously observing May Day military parades. We had no gauge of the humanity beneath the pointed hats of Soviet generals or the thought processes behind the dyspeptic visage of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish prime minister who presided over the clampdown on Lech Walesa's Solidarity labor movement in 1981.</p><p> In this well-done biography of Ryszard Kuklinski, a Polish army officer who became a prized double agent for U.S. intelligence, Benjamin Weiser has colored in those drab profiles. A Secret Life is a real-life spy thriller that reveals the passions and tensions faced by Polish leaders under the thumb of Moscow during the 1970s and '80s. Weiser has produced a fascinating portrayal of Kuklinski, who decided that the best way to serve Polish nationalism was to become a spy for the West.</p><p> Putting together a readable narrative about Kuklinski was no easy task, but Weiser, a New York Times metropolitan reporter and former investigative reporter for The Washington Post, made good choices. First off, he established a triangulated method for obtaining classified CIA material, in which a researcher working for him would obtain security clearance, read the documents and make deletions of restricted material before delivering them to the author. Obtaining his own clearance would have forced Weiser to submit his manuscript for CIA approval, the bane of any journalist. </p><p> Weiser's lively narrative describes Kuklinski's nine years working for U.S. intelligence, converting interviews and a mountain of documentation into a page-turner. It's interesting, even quaint, to read about CIA intelligence operations in the years before encrypted, wireless networking, the Internet and other advances changed the nature of communications. Kuklinski and his CIA handlers did everything by hand, spending months searching for drop zones and escape routes, wandering the streets for hours and days to make sure they weren't being tailed.</p><p> But the human dimension is what sets this story apart. Kuklinski chose to be a spy because he hated the Soviet domination of Poland, but we somehow never feel certain about his deeper motivations. Apparently, he was not in it for the money, but because he believed that Poland must be free of Soviet domination. Yet in some correspondence with the CIA, he spoke naively about Soviet intentions in Poland, as if Moscow's utter domination of the country and the rest of the East Bloc were open to question. Any thought that Stalin and his successors cared about political independence would have been out of character for a skilled analyst like Kuklinski, who had seen Soviet troops march into Czechoslovakia in 1968.</p><p> Kuklinski sometimes sagged under the unrelenting pressure of his double life. He had to keep his activities secret from his wife, sons and closest friends, and devised daring methods of photographing and secreting away documents. All the while, Kuklinski moved higher in the military hierarchy. He wrote strategies for war games with the Warsaw Pact and was in the loop as leaders debated whether to send out troops to stop Walesa's labor movement. He dutifully photographed the most sensitive documents and delivered them promptly, so that U.S. policymakers had a top-level mole providing real-time information on military strategy, tactics and matï¿½riel.</p><p> The story has poignant and humorous aspects. Kuklinski maintained written correspondence with his confessor-control agent, code-named Daniel. "I am grateful to you for your friendship," Kuklinski wrote, "which you invariably sustain, caring about and doing everything for my security." </p><p>Although Daniel eventually was reassigned to Vienna, the CIA decided to continue the correspondence in his name. So when Daniel wrote that "our friendship cannot be terminated and will endure and grow in strength forever," the author was actually a harried committee of CIA operatives working overtime to strike a tone that would sound just like Kuklinski's warm-bodied confidante.</p><p> Exhausted and ground down by the pressure, Kuklinski approached the moment of maximum usefulness to the United States in 1981 when the Kremlin threatened to invade Poland and shut down Solidarity. At the climactic moment, Kuklinski thought his cover was blown and contacted the Americans for an emergency rescue.</p><p> It was no surprise that Kuklinski was sentenced to death in absentia by a Polish military court, but the sentence held for years after the fall of communism in Europe. Kuklinski, who became an American citizen, visited Poland occasionally after his conviction was overturned in 1998. He died in Tampa, Fla., on Feb. 10 of this year, at the age of 73. CIA director George Tenet has called him "a true hero of the Cold War," and Walesa said he was "a spy for the right cause." But Jaruzelski said that "to consider him, to treat him, as a hero would be to discredit those who served the army at the time." Weiser, allowing us to reach our own conclusions, raises complex questions about honor and the meaning of loyalty. But it is clear that Kuklinski's decision to work for the United States was an act of great courage and sacrifice. </p><p> </p><p>Reviewed by Peter Eisner</p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Her skin was dry and the dark circles under her eyes were more pronounced than they'd been when she went to bed.<br><br> Denise sneered at her reflection in the mirror. She had now spent an hour on damage control, but it was never good enough.<br><br> "You look and smell like a hooker," she said, mimicking her grandmother's voice as she applied her eyeliner one more time.<br><br> In the studio apartments around her, the noise signaled that the other tenants were waking up and that it would soon be evening again. It was a well-known cacophony of sounds: the chinking of bottles, the knocking on doors to bum cigarettes, and the constant traffic to and from the run-down toilet with shower that the contract described as exclusive.<br><br> The small society of Danish outcasts from one of the darker streets of Frederiksstaden was now set in motion for yet another evening with no real purpose.<br><br> After turning around a few times, she stepped toward the mirror to inspect her face close-up.<br><br> "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?" She laughed with an indulgent smile as she caressed her reflection with her fingertips. She puckered her lips, let her fingers slide up her hips, over her breasts, up to her neck, and into her hair. She picked some fluff from her angora blouse and dabbed a little foundation on a couple of insufficiently covered blemishes on her face before stepping back with satisfaction. Her plucked and painted eyebrows together with NeuLash-enhanced eyelashes added to her overall appearance. The makeup, together with the glow of her irises, gave her a more intense look, adding with ease an extra element of aloofness.<br><br> In other words, she was ready to take on the world.<br><br> "I'm Denise," she practiced saying, tensing her throat. It was as deep as her voice could be.<br><br> "Denise," she whispered, slowly parting her lips and letting her chin drop toward her chest. The result was fantastic when she adopted this attitude. Some might interpret her look as submissive, but it was exactly the opposite. Wasn't it precisely at this angle that the hotspots-a woman's eyelashes and pupils-best caught the attention of those around her?<br><br> Totally in control. She nodded, screwing the lid of her face cream back on and piling her arsenal of cosmetics back in the bathroom cabinet.<br><br> After a quick look around the small room she realized that hours of hard work lay ahead of her: clearing away the laundry, making the bed, washing all the glasses, taking out the trash, and sorting all the bottles.<br><br> Fuck it, she thought, grabbing the duvet and shaking it and plumping the pillow, convincing herself that when one of her sugar daddies had made it this far, he wouldn't give a damn about the rest.<br><br> She sat on the edge of the bed and checked that her handbag had all the essentials she would need.<br><br> She nodded with satisfaction. She was ready to take on the world and all its desires.<br><br> An unwelcome sound made her turn to face the door. Click, clack, click, clack, came the limping, loathsome sound.<br><br> You're far too early, Mother, she thought as the door outside between the stairs and the corridor was pushed open.<br><br> It was almost eight o'clock, so why was she coming now? It was way past her dinnertime.<br><br> She counted the seconds, already feeling irritated as she got up from the bed, when the knock came at the door.<br><br> "Honey!" she heard her mother shouting from the other side. "Won't you open the door?" Denise took deep breaths, remaining silent. If she didn't answer, her mother would surely just go.<br><br> "Denise, I know you're in there. Open up just for a moment. I have something important to tell you."<br><br> Denise sighed. "And why should I do that? I don't suppose you brought any dinner up with you?" she shouted.<br><br> "Not today, no. Oh, won't you come downstairs to eat, Denise? Just for today. Your grandmother is here!"<br><br> Denise rolled her eyes. So her grandmother was downstairs. The mere thought was enough to make her heart race and cause her to break out in a sweat.<br><br> "Grandmother can kiss my ass. I hate that bitch."<br><br> "Oh, Denise, you mustn't talk like that. Won't you just let me in for a moment? I really must speak with you."<br><br> "Not now. Just leave the dinner in front of the door, as usual." Apart from the man with the flabby skin who lived a few doors down the corridor, who had already downed his first beer of the day and was now sobbing in despair over his miserable existence, it was suddenly totally quiet out in the corridor. It wouldn't surprise her if everyone was pricking up their ears right at this moment, but what did she care? They could just ignore her mother like she did.<br><br> Denise filtered out the sound of her mother's pleas, concentrating instead on the whining coming from the loser down the hall. All the divorced men like him living in studio apartments were just so pathetic and laughable. How could they believe the future might be brighter given how they looked? They stank of unwashed clothes and drank themselves into oblivion in their pitiful loneliness. How could these cringeworthy idiots live with being so pathetic?<br><br> Denise snorted. How often had they stood in front of her door in an effort to tempt her with their small talk and cheap wine from Aldi, their eyes betraying hope of something else and more?<br><br> As if she would ever associate with men who lived in studio apartments.<br><br> "She's brought money with her for us, Denise," her mother said insistently.<br><br> Now she had Denise's attention.<br><br> "You simply have to come down with me because if you don't she won't give us anything for this month."<br><br> There was a pause before she spoke again.<br><br> "And then we really won't have anything, will we, Denise?" she said severely.<br><br> "Can't you shout a little louder so they can also hear you in the next building?" Denise retorted.<br><br> "Denise!" Her mother's voice was now quivering. "I'm warning you. If your grandmother doesn't give us that money, you'll have to go to the social services office because I haven't paid your rent for this month. Or maybe you thought I had?"<br><br> Denise took a deep breath, went over to the mirror, and put on her lipstick one final time. Ten minutes with the woman and then she was out of there. She had nothing but shit and confrontation coming her way. The bitch wouldn't leave her in peace for a second. She would just come with demand after demand. And if there was something Denise couldn't deal with, it was all the demands people put on her. It simply drained all the life and energy out of her.<br><br> It depleted her.<br><br> Down on the first floor in her motherï¿½s apartment there was a not unexpected stench of tinned mock turtle soup. Once in a while it might be cutlets only just past their sell-by date or rice pudding in sausage-shaped plastic packaging. There wasnï¿½t exactly entrec&#x2122;te on the menu when her mother attempted to put on a spread, which the blemished silver-plated candlesticks with spluttering candles emphasized.<br><br> In this flickering artificial ambience the vulture was already seated at the center of the table, scowling and ready to attack. Denise was almost knocked out from the stench of her cheap perfume and powder, which no shop with any self-respect would demean itself to sell.<br><br> Now her grandmother parted her dry, red, blotchy lips. Maybe the vulture was preparing to smile, but Denise was not so easily fooled. She attempted to count to ten but this time made it to only three before the woman's verbal abuse began.<br><br> "Well! The little princess could finally find time to come down and say hello."<br><br> A dark and disapproving look came over the grandmother's face after a quick inspection of Denise's seminude midriff.<br><br> "Already plastered with makeup and I don't know what. No one will miss you coming, because that really would be a catastrophe, wouldn't it, Dorrit?"<br><br> "Would you stop calling me that? It's almost ten years since I changed my name."<br><br> "Since you ask so politely, yes, as it isn't something one is accustomed to from you. Then you think that name becomes you better, do you . . . Denise? A little more French. It almost puts one in mind of the suggestively dressed ladies of the night, so, yes, maybe it is more fitting." She looked her up and down. "Then congratulations with the camouflage work, is all I can say. You've prepared yourself for the hunt, I wouldn't wonder."<br><br> Denise noticed how her mother tried to calm the mood with a slight touch of her hand on her grandmother's arm, as if that had ever worked. Even in that area her mother had always been weak.<br><br> "And what have you been up to, if one might inquire?" continued her grandmother. "There was something about a new course, or was it actually an internship?" She squinted. "Was it a job as a nail technician you wanted to try this time? I almost can't keep up with all the excitement in your life, so you'll have to help me. But wait, maybe you're not actually doing anything at the moment? Could that be it?"<br><br> Denise didn't answer. She just tried to keep her lips sealed. Her grandmother raised her eyebrows. "Oh yes, you're much too precious for work, aren't you?"<br><br> Why did she bother asking when she had all the answers? Why was she sitting there hiding behind her wiry grey hair in a mask of disgust? It made you want to spit at her. What stopped her from doing it?<br><br> "Denise has decided to enroll in a course to learn how to coach people," interjected her mother bravely.<br><br> The metamorphosis was enormous. Her grandmother's mouth was open, aghast; the wrinkles on her nose disappeared; and after a short pause the change was accompanied by a laugh that came so deep from within her rotten core that it made the hair on Denise's neck stand on end.<br><br> "Oh, that's what she's decided, is it? An interesting thought, Denise coaching other people. Just in what, exactly, if I might inquire? Is it actually possible to find anyone in this disturbed world who would want to be coached by someone who can do absolutely nothing besides dolling themselves up? In that case, the world must have come to a complete standstill."<br><br> "Mother-" Denise's mother attempted to interrupt.<br><br> "Be quiet, Birgit. Let me finish." She turned toward Denise. "I will be direct. I don't know anyone as lazy, talentless, or with so little sense of reality as you, Denise. Shall we agree that you actually can't do anything? Isn't it high time that you tried to get a job to fit your modest talents?" She waited for an answer, but none was forthcoming. She shook her head, leaving Denise in no doubt as to what was coming next.<br><br> "I have said it before and I have warned you, Denise. Maybe you think it is acceptable to just lie on your back? It's downright shocking. You're not as beautiful as you think, my dear, and certainly won't be in five years, I'm afraid."<br><br> Denise inhaled deeply through her nose. Two more minutes and she'd be out of here.<br><br> Now her grandmother turned to her mother with the same cold, contemptuous expression. "You were the same, Birgit. Thought only of yourself, never doing anything to get on in life. What would you have done without your father and me? If we hadn't paid for everything while you squandered life away in your self-obsessed megalomania?"<br><br> "I have worked, Mother." Her tone was pitiable. It was years since her ammunition of protests hadn't fallen on deaf ears.<br><br> It was now Denise's turn again, as her grandmother turned her attention back toward her, shaking her head.<br><br> "And as for you! You couldn't even get a job folding clothes, if that's what you think."<br><br> Denise turned around and disappeared into the kitchen with the poison from her grandmother trailing behind her.<br><br> If it was possible to see what was inside her grandmother, the ingredients could be laid out in equal measure of intense hatred, vengeance, and unending images of how different she thought everything had once been. Denise had heard the same fake nonsense over and over, and it was irritatingly hurtful every time. About what a good family she and her mother came from; about the golden years when her grandfather had had his shoe shop in Rï¿½dovre and earned really good money.<br><br> All a load of crap! Hadn't the women in this family always stayed at home and done their duty? Hadn't they been supported solely by their husbands, been meticulous about their appearance, and looked after the home?<br><br> Hell yes!<br><br> "Mother! You mustn't be too hard on her. She-"<br><br> "Denise is twenty-seven and is good for exactly nothing, Birgit. Nothing!" shouted the witch. "How do you two propose to survive when I'm not here anymore, can you answer me that? Don't for one second expect any significant inheritance from me. I have my own needs."<br><br> Something else they had heard a hundred times before. In a moment she would attack Denise's mother again. She would call her shabby and a failure, before accusing her of passing on all her negative qualities to her granddaughter.<br><br> Denise felt disgust and hatred right to the pit of her stomach. She hated the shrill voice, attacks, and demands. Hated her mother for being so weak and for not having been able to keep a man who could look after them all. Hated her grandmother precisely because that was what she had done.<br><br> Why wouldn't she just lie down and die?<br><br> "I'm out of here," said Denise coldly when she stepped back into the dining room.<br><br> "Oh, are you, now? Well then, you won't be having this." Her grandmother pulled a bundle of notes from her handbag and held it in front of them. One-thousand-kroner notes.<br><br> "Come and sit down now, Denise," her mother implored.<br><br> "Yes, come and sit down for a moment before you go out and sell yourself," came the next tirade from her grandmother. "Eat your mother's awful meal before you head out to find men to ply you with booze. But be careful, Denise, because the way you are, you'll never find a decent man who'll go for you! A cheap girl with fake hair and hair color, fake breasts, fake jewelry, and bad skin. Don't you think they'll see through you in a second, my dear? Or maybe you think a decent man can't tell the difference between elegance and your cheap appearance? Maybe you don't think that as soon as you open your bloodred mouth that he'll immediately discover that you know absolutely nothing and have nothing to say? That you're just a waste of space?"</p><h2>Fat Land: How Americans Became the Fattest People in the World</h2><p>In this astonishing expose, journalist Greg Critser looks beyond the sensational headlines to reveal why nearly 60 percent of Americans are now overweight. Critser&#39;s sharp-eyed reportage and sharp-tongued analysis make for a disarmingly funny and truly alarming book. Critser investigates the many factors of American life -- from supersize to Super Mario, from high-fructose corn syrup to the high cost of physical education in schools -- that have converged and conspired to make us some of the fattest people on the planet. He also explains why pediatricians are treating conditions rarely before noticed in children, why Type 2 diabetes is on the rise, and how agribusiness has unwittingly altered the American diet.</p><p>GREG CRITSER is a longtime chronicler of the modern pharmaceutical industry and the politics of medicine. His columns and essays on the subject have appeared in Harper&#x2019;s Magazine, USA Today, the Wall Street Journal, the L.A. Times, and elsewhere. Critser is the author of Fat Land: How Americans Became the Fattest People in the World (Houghton Mifflin), which the American Diabetes Association called &#x201c;the definitive journalistic account of the modern obesity epidemic.&#x201d; He lives in Pasadena, California, with his wife, Antoinette Mongelli.INTRODUCTION Obesity is the dominant unmet global health issue, with Western countries topping the list.<br> World Health Organization<br><br>Set the soul of thy son aright, and all the rest will be added hereafter!<br> Saint John Chrysostom<br><br>This book is not a memoir, but it is undeniably grounded in a singular personal experience. My experience was not, for those hoping for something juicy, a moment of childhood drama. Nor was it anything that led to any form of spiritual or true psychological revelation. Compared to the harrowing tribulations that so much of the world&#x2019;s population endures, it was, when all is said and done, rather mundane and petty. Here it is: Some guy called me fatso. Specifically, he screamed: Watch it, fatso!&#x201d; Here I should note that I deserved the abuse; after all, I had opened my car door into a busy street without looking into my side mirror first, and so had nearly decapitated the poor fellow. I could have killed him. But why . . . fatso? Could it be because I was indeed forty pounds overweight? Or that I could not fit into any of my clothes, even the ones I got at the Gap that were labeled relaxed&#x201d; (which, come to think of it, I wasn&#x2019;t), let alone the ones considered baggy&#x201d; (which, again come to think of it, I was)? Could it be because I had to back up ten feet so as to get my entire face into the bathroom mirror to shave every morning? Or that when I dined with friends they hid their small pets and seemed to guard their plates, one arm curled around them, as if I might plunge my fork into their juicy pieces of duck and make off with them? I&#x2019;m obviously joking about the latter, but the point is that the insult hit home. In upwardly mobile, professional America, being fat and having someone actually notice it and say something about it is almost as bad as getting caught reading Playboy in your parents&#x2019; bedroom when you&#x2019;re ten. Shame shame shame.<br> Fatness was hardly a new issue for me. My wife and my physician had been after me for some time to do something about my problem, the former quite gingerly, the latter not so. My doctor, in fact, had recently suggested that I consider a new weight loss medication. At the time, I had promptly brushed the idea aside. Now, the sting still fresh, I reconsidered: Why not?<br> And so, for the next nine months, I put all of my extra energy into the task of shedding my excess avoirdupois. In modern America, this, I would find, was a rite in itself, replete with its own social institutions (health clubs), tonics (Meridia), taboos (Krispy Kreme), and aspirational totems (Levi&#x2019;s 501 regular cuts). I was apparently ready for this rite, for, to my delight, I slowly but surely lost the weight. What followed was encouraging, if somewhat predictable: congratulations from friends for sticking to it&#x201d;; enhanced self-esteem; a new wardrobe; a newfound confidence and spring in my step; phone calls from J.Lo. and Julia.<br> Yet the more I contemplated my success, the more I came to see it not as a triumph of will, but as a triumph of my economic and social class. The weight loss medication Meridia, for example, had been effective not because it is such a good drug; even its purveyors freely admit it is far from effective for most people. What had made the drug work for me was the upper-middle-class support system that I had brought to it: a good physician who insisted on seeing me every two weeks, access to a safe park where I would walk and jog, friends who shared the value of becoming slender, healthy home-cooked food consumed with my wife, books about health, and medical journals about the latest nutritional breakthroughs. And money. And time.<br> I wrote about these insights, first for a local magazine, then in my column in USA Today, where I write about the politics of health. I then moved on to other topics. As is the case with most subject matter, fatness had remained, at least for me, somewhat abstract, distant intellectual rather than emotional. It was certainly nothing one could view as a matter of national urgency.<br> Then, two things happened which would change that.<br> For one, I met a man named James O. Hill. Hill is a physiologist at the University of Colorado&#x2019;s Health Sciences Center. Curly-haired, a bit provocative, Hill is a vigorous, intellectually engaged fellow with an agile debating style and a wide-ranging presence in his field. Hill&#x2019;s field is the study of obesity, everything from its epidemiology to its causes to its treatment. It was Hill who, only a few years ago, coined what may be the single most quoted line in regard to today&#x2019;s soaring obesity rates. If obesity is left unchecked,&#x201d; he told the Associated Press, almost all Americans will be overweight by 2050.&#x201d; Becoming obbese, he went on, is a normal response to the American environment.&#x201d; With a presence on all of the leading public health committees charged with doing something about the nation&#x2019;s expanding waistline, Hill is the dean of obesity studies. It was my fortune to meet him at just the right time.<br> Hill spelled out the problem more clearly than anyone else. See, for decades, most of us believed that the rate of overweight in this country was relatively static somewhere around 25 percent of the population would be always overweight,&#x201d; he recalled one day. But then, beginning in the late eighties, we started seeing that rate spike upward, 30, 35, 40 percent. And that started freaking a lot of us out. Where were the gains coming from? We know that obesity has a strong genetic component, but twenty years anyone knows that is a laughingly small amount of time for genetics to change so much. So for the guys like myself, the question has become, basically, what has changed in the environment to allow the inclination toward overweight and obesity to express itself? What changed around us to allow us to get so big?&#x201d; Big, of course, is putting it mildly. Today Americans are the fattest people on the face of the earth (save for the inhabitants of a few South Seas islands). About 61 percent of Americans are overweight overweight enough to begin experiencing health problems as a direct result of that weight. About 20 percent of us are obese so fat that our lives will likely be cut short by excess fat. More than 5 million Americans now meet the definition of morbid obesity; they are so obese that they qualify for a radical surgical technique known as gastroplasty, wherein the stomach is surgically altered so as to keep food from being digested. (The American Bariatric Society, whose members perform gastroplasty, reports that its waiting lists are months long and that its surgeons can&#x2019;t keep up.&#x201d;) Children are most at risk from obesity. About 25 percent of all Americans under age nineteen are overweight or obese, a figure that, Hill points out, has doubled in thirty years. That one figure recently moved U.S. Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher to declare obesity to be a national epidemic. Today,&#x201d; he told a group of federal bureaucrats and health policy officers, we see a nation of young people seriously at risk of starting out obese and dooming themselves to the difficult task of overcoming a tough illness.&#x201d; Obesity itself is slowly moving into the middle and upper classes, but the condition disproportionately plagues the poor and the working poor. Mexican American women aged 20 to 74, for example, have an obesity rate about 13 percent higher for those living below the poverty line versus those above the poverty line. Diabetes occurs at a rate of 16 to 26 percent in both Hispanic and black Americans aged 45 to 74, compared to 12 percent in non-Hispanic whites of the same age.<br> Yet most of America particularly the America of the Me Generation seems to be in deep denial about the class and age aspects of obesity. Get a group of boomers together and, within minutes, the topic of obesity shifts not to medical issues but, rather, to aesthetic and gender issues, to the notion widely held in the urban upper middle class that talking too much about obesity just ends up making kids have low self-esteem.&#x201d; Or that it might lead to anorexia.&#x201d; Those attitudes also permeate the medical sphere; doctors and other health care providers remain either in ignorance or outright denial about the health danger to the poor and the young. In a rare moment of industry scrutiny a few years ago, the Centers for Disease Control surveyed twelve thousand obese adults to find out what, exactly, their doctors were telling them. The results were arresting. Fewer than half reported being advised to lose weight. A separate study sharpened the indictment: Patients with incomes above $50,000 were more likely to receive such advice than were those with incomes below. As the Journal of the American Medical Association noted, The lower rates of counseling among respondents with lower education and income levels . . . are particularly worrisome, because members of lower socioeconomic groups have poorer health outcomes.&#x201d; Yes, worrisome. Yet we Americans are inured to such dirges, which daily seem to well up from the pages of our newspapers. Certainly I was. Until, that is, the unexpected intruded.<br> It happened in the Intensive Care Unit of Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center, one of the nation&#x2019;s busiest hospitals. I was there visiting an ailing relative when, suddenly, a gaggle of interns, nurses, and orderlies pushed a gurney through the ward. On it lay a very large young man, perhaps 450 pounds, hooked to the ganglia of modern medicine. He had just undergone an emergency gastroplasty repair, and it did not look good. As I came to learn, first through bits and pieces exchanged by the ward nurses, then through comments by the patient&#x2019;s parents, it was not the first emergency for this man. As his mother, a modestly dressed woman in her forties, moaned at one point, Second time in three months . . . his stomach keeps coming unstapled&#x201d; (not all forms of gastroplasty actually involve stapling, as did older forms of obesity surgery, but many still refer to it that way). The woman then leaned on the shoulder of her weary husband. My . . . boy.&#x201d; Her boy was dying from his own fat.<br> Yes, he was dying, and yes, the more I looked, the more I could see: Here was someone&#x2019;s boy, one plagued, I imagined, by years of bad health, discomfort, self-loathing, and, of course, countless insults and snickers by passersby and friends alike. But someone&#x2019;s little boy nonetheless. Watching him as he gasped for air respiratory function is one of the first things that can go when one gets so big I could not help think: There but for the grace of God go I. And, to hear Jim Hill and Dr. Satcher tell it, a large number of other decent Americans.<br> Driving home that night, through the barrio of East L.A., then up the chilly black Pasadena Freeway to the town where I live, I wondered just how a boy becomes so disabled. Genes certainly played a role, but as Jim Hill had lucidly pointed out, genes have always played a role in obesity. The question was, why are we seeing so many more people like the one I just saw? How exactly had they been made? And if it is true that, in America, every man is his own author, that every man, as Ivan Illich once wrote, is responsible for what has been made of him,&#x201d; then what, as a nation, is being made of us by the obese?<br> I decided to find out: How is it that we better-off Americans, perhaps the most health-conscious of any generation in the history of the world, have come to preside over the deadly fattening of our youth and their future? That is the story you will read on the following pages, and that is why we must now turn to the strange career of one Earl L. Butz . . .<br><br>Copyright ï¿½ 2003 by Greg Critser.

Before I was ten I knew what it was to step off the sidewalk to let a white man pass.</p><p>MARGARET WALKER</p><p>Nourished by anger, revolutions are born of hope. They are the offspring of belief and bitterness, of faith in the attainment of one&#x2019;s goals and indignation at the limited rate and extent of change. Rarely in history are the two stirrings confluent in a sufficient force to generate an effective, radical social movement. They would be so in African America in the 1960s.</p><p>During the last decade of the nineteenth century, however, few African-Americans struggled hopefully. Many African-Americans resisted, often in subtle and solitary ways, at times in an organized and collective manner, transmitting from one generation to the next a tradition of black protest. But their initial efforts to continue the campaign against Jim Crow initiated by the black abolitionists failed to stem the rising crest of white racism after Reconstruction. Largely bereft of white allies, blacks fought on the defensive, trying to hold their limited gains. They lost each battle. Congress permitted the white South to reduce blacks to a state of peonage, to disregard their civil rights, and to disenfranchise them by force, intimidation, and statute. So did the Supreme Court. Writing into the Constitution its own beliefs in the inferiority of blacks, the late-nineteenth-century high court tightened every possible shackle confining the ex-slaves. Most American scholars cheered this legal counterrevolution which effectively nullified the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. It exemplified their teachings of inherent and irremediable racial differences, of blacks as the most primitive, degraded, and least civilized of the races, and of the folly of governmental tampering with local folkways. Whether appealing to scriptural or scientific evidence, to Darwinism, the gospel of Anglo-Saxonism, or the new interest in eugenics, a generation of clergymen, editors, and educators propounded the intellectual rationalizations for white supremacy.</p><p>Not surprisingly, most white Americans at the beginning of the twentieth century believed that, for the good of all, the naturally superior whites should rule over the baser races. They heard or read little to the contrary. The Southern Way had become the American Way. Even the most humanitarian reformers concerned with racial injustice counseled gradualism. Northern liberals preached the necessity of deferring citizenship for blacks until the freedmen were ready for it; they emphasized the long-term gains to be derived from education, religion, and economic uplift and denigrated strategies predicated on agitation, force, or political activity.</p><p>This total acquiescence by government officials and Northern public opinion gave the white South all the permission it needed to institutionalize its white-supremacist beliefs. First came disenfranchisement, accomplished in the 1880s mainly through fraud and force. All the Southern states felt emboldened in the next two decades to follow the lead of the 1890 Mississippi state constitutional convention in officially adopting such disenfranchising techniques as poll taxes, &#x201c;grandfather clauses,&#x201d; literacy and &#x201c;good character&#x201d; tests, and white primaries. Black voter registration plummeted 96 percent in Louisiana between 1896 and 1900. The number of African-Americans permitted to vote in the new century hovered around 3,500 in Alabama, which had an adult black population of nearly 300,000; and in Mississippi, with an even larger black population, fewer than a thousand blacks voted.</p><p>Political impotency bore on every aspect of African-American life. Unable to participate in the enactment or enforcement of the law, Southern blacks became increasingly vulnerable to physical assault and murder. Over a thousand were lynched between 1900 and 1915. No records exist to tally the number beaten or tortured. Nor can one describe adequately the terror of living with a constant fear of barbarity and violence, of having your security subject to the whim of those who despise you, of having no recourse to police or courts.</p><p>The Southern states, in addition, adopted a host of statutes methodically outlawing everything &#x201c;interracial.&#x201d; These new segregation laws expressed the white South&#x2019;s all-encompassing belief in the inequality of blacks. Most Southern states now formally required Negroes and whites to be born separately in segregated hospitals; to live their lives as separately as possible in segregated schools, public accommodations, and places of work and recreation; and, presumably, to dwell in the next life separately in segregated funeral homes and cemeteries. The rapid proliferation of Jim Crow laws inspired an irrational competition among Southern legislators to erect ever more and higher barriers between the races. &#x201c;White&#x201d; and &#x201c;Colored&#x201d; signs sprouted everywhere and on everything. Atlanta mandated Jim Crow Bibles in its courtrooms and prohibited African-Americans and whites from using the same park facilities, even from visiting the municipal zoo at the same time. Alabama forbade African-Americans to play checkers with whites, and Mississippi insisted on Jim Crow taxicabs. New Orleans segregated its prostitutes, and Oklahoma, its telephone booths. The lawmakers of Florida and North Carolina saw to it that white students would never touch textbooks used by African-Americans. Such edicts bolstered white power and privilege while demeaning the spirit of African-Americans.</p><p>Jim Crow, furthermore, easily led to gross inequities in the distribution of public monies for education and civic services. The eleven Southern states in 1916 spent an average of $10.32 per white public-school student, and only $2.89 per black pupil. There was one hospital bed available for every 139 American whites in the 1920s, but only one for every 1,941 blacks. And that was not all. Southern governments victimized blacks by bestial convict-leasing and chain-gang practices, and confined them to serfdom on the lowest rung of the economic ladder, doing all they could to implement the view of James K. Vardaman, who became Governor of Mississippi in 1904, that &#x201c;God Almighty had created the Negro for a menial.&#x201d;</p><p>Alexis de Tocqueville&#x2019;s observation early in the nineteenth century that white Americans &#x201c;scarcely acknowledge the common features of humanity in this stranger whom slavery has brought among them&#x201d; remained as accurate a century later.</p><p>And blacks could do little to alter the situation. More than 90 percent of the nearly ten million African-Americans in 1910 lived in the South, three-quarters of them in rural areas, the vast majority working a white man&#x2019;s land, with a white man&#x2019;s mule and a white man&#x2019;s credit. Theirs was an oppressive, closed society, designed to thwart black advancement and encourage black subservience. All political and economic power remained vested in whites determined to maintain the status quo, however many black lives it cost. Daily facing grinding poverty, physical helplessness, and all the banal crudities of existence under an open, professed, and boasting racism, many blacks grew fatalistic. Segregation and discrimination came to seem permanent, immutable, an inevitable condition of life, and the majority of African-Americans succumbed to the new racial order.</p><p>But not all. Some protested by migrating. Between 1890 and 1910, nearly two hundred thousand Southern blacks fled to the North. Others returned to Africa or established autonomous black communities in the West. A few, mostly members of the tiny, Northern black elite, continued the struggle they had inherited from the black abolitionists and from the inspiring vision of equal rights nourished by the Civil War and Reconstruction. They spoke out for racial justice in such organizations as the Afro-American Council, Monroe Trotter&#x2019;s National Equal Rights League, Ida B. Wells&#x2019;s Antilynching League, and the Niagara Movement. Yet few blacks heard their pleas, and fewer whites heeded their demands. These small communities of resistance and struggle in the early twentieth century, lacking adequate finances, political leverage, influential white allies, access to the major institutions shaping public opinion and policy, and the support of large numbers of blacks, could do virtually nothing to alter the course of American life and thought. As Willie Brown lamented in his blues:</p><p>Can&#x2019;t tell my future, I can&#x2019;t tell my past.</p><p>Lord, it seems like every minute sure gon&#x2019; be my last.</p><p>Oh, a minute seems like hours, and hours seem like days.</p><p>And a minute seems like hours, hour seems like days.</p><p>The ascendancy of Booker T. Washington at the turn of the century epitomized both the widespread despair of blacks and the powerlessness of the handful of blacks actively fighting against racial injustice. Although he worked covertly to diminish disenfranchisement and Jim Crow, Washington publicly emphasized the necessity of accommodation, conciliation, and gradualism. &#x201c;The best course to pursue in regard to civil rights,&#x201d; he lectured to blacks, &#x201c;is to let it alone; let it alone and it will settle itself.&#x201d; When the British author H. G. Wells criticized Jim Crow while on a visit to the United States, Washington answered back: &#x201c;The only answer to it is for colored men to be patient, to make themselves competent, to do good work, to give no occasion against us.&#x201d; A spokesman for the emerging black middle class, he counseled all blacks to lift themselves up by their own bootstraps. Too few, however, even had boots, and in the years before his death in 1915, Washington&#x2019;s nostrums failed abysmally to alleviate the plight of blacks.</p><p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, organized in 1910, fared no better.

She lives in Gold Beach, Oregon.INTRODUCTION: DISTORTING MIRRORS, SPLIT SELVES, AND THE ORIGIN OF MONSTERS<br><br>To be a monster is to be inhuman. Or to be a monster is to be all-too-human. Eitherway, in order to talk about monsters, one first must talk about what it means to be human.<br><br>For the Chinese, the idea of the human goes back to Confucius.He used the word <i>ren</i>, whichmeans &#x2018;&#x2018;man&#x2019;&#x2019; or &#x2018;&#x2018;human,&#x2019;&#x2019; to name the values that make a just and moral being, such as filial piety of child to parent, loyalty of citizen to ruler, just treatment of citizens by rulers, and reciprocity &#x2013; treating others as you would wish to be treated by them. Most world religions have a similar notion of reciprocity. Even when the reciprocity is bloody, as in the Babylonian and Jewish notion of &#x2018;&#x2018;an eye for an eye,&#x2019;&#x2019; it functions as an attempt to limit vendettas: take <i>only</i> one eye for the loss of yours, in other words. Out of such ideas comes the entire legal justice system, as well as the immensely complex set of balanced and reciprocal interactions thatmake up our daily social life. The monstrous, then, is often that which is outside such social codes. In <i>Beowulf</i>, the monster Grendel is much like the humans: he is a warrior for his kind, he lives in a hall like those he kills and terrorizes, he is loved by his mother just like the Danes, but he dwells outside of human boundaries and so is referred to as a &#x2018;&#x2018;borderdweller.&#x2019;&#x2019; One way in which he dwells on the border is that he kills others outside of human codes: he refuses to pay the &#x2018;&#x2018;were-gild&#x2019;&#x2019; (the &#x2018;&#x2018;man-price&#x2019;&#x2019;) for those he slaughters. Killing is not monstrous; that&#x2019;s what warriors do. Killing without reciprocity, killing without law, is what makes Grendel a monster in men&#x2019;s eyes.<br><br>Modern theories of social justice originated from the idea that just societies balance social needs with the good of the individual person, and that humans have certain inalienable rights by nature. In other words, to value humans is our human nature, and the devaluation of humanity &#x2013; by horrendous individual crime or tyrannical government &#x2013; is unnatural and inhuman. To be human, in other words, is to be humane, and to be inhumane is to be monstrous.<br><br>On the other hand, our deepest human drives can be misconceived as inhuman, simply because they are wild, lawless, unrepressed, Dionysian instead of Apollonian. Our battle with these drives is often projected out of the self as a battle with a monster, as in the case of Spenser&#x2019;s Redcross Knight who crosses the landscape battling manifestations of psychological excess, which is to say &#x2018;&#x2018;sin.&#x2019;&#x2019; In William Morris&#x2019; retelling of the Norse <i>Saga of the Volsung</i>, Fafnir kills his own father and takes possession of mountains of elf-gold, but his greed and lust for power are so monstrously exaggerated that he suffers a physical transformation and becomes a dragon. The pages of this anthology are filled with such Grinchy nasty-wastiness and burbling Jabberwocky rage, with cannibalistic werewolf hunger and tygerish pride and Promethean aspiration, all manifesting the monstrousness of human nature.<br><br>These internal battles with human drives may be why the image of the mirror figures in so many monstrous tales. In Jorge Luis Borges&#x2019; poem &#x2018;&#x2018;To the Mirror&#x2019;&#x2019; it is a kind of vampire that sucks our life and luck away by duplicating us, by showing us to ourselves. Mirror, mirror on the wall, who&#x2019;s the most monstrous one of all? In William Baer&#x2019;s poem &#x2018;&#x2018;Monster,&#x2019;&#x2019; when a slinking, creeping creature sneaks into the narrator&#x2019;s car and looks into the rearview mirror, the face reflected back is his own. He is monstrous because he hates himself, because he <i>feels</i> like an outsider. The mirror is a literalizing of the idea of the split self. Perhaps we are most monstrous when we are so alienated from ourselves that we feel certain we are unlovable.<br><br>Monsters truly are hard to love, since it is a risky thing to sleep with them. Flippered and dripping, will he take you to the Black Lagoon to drown, or be your handsome man in the day and then sneak off to be a bloated giant caterpillar at night? Will you freeze under her baleful gaze until you turn to stone? What kind of relationship can you have, when your gaze distorts her: &#x2018;&#x2018;Why do you keep creating us half-human,/with bat wings, dragon scales, luminous green skin,/as if you can&#x2019;t appreciate ordinary women anymore,/as if you fear what lies beneath?&#x2019;&#x2019; ( Jeannine Hall Gailey&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;Here There Be Monsters&#x2019;&#x2019;). You try to accept her, but can&#x2019;t. After all, you&#x2019;re only human. Or she tries to accept herself, but can&#x2019;t, as in Allyson Shaw&#x2019;s sestina &#x2018;&#x2018;Mermaid Surgery,&#x2019;&#x2019; where it doesn&#x2019;t matter that she is &#x2018;&#x2018;a waking sailor&#x2019;s dream/ . . . the prettiest in the sea,&#x2019;&#x2019; because what she really wants is feet. How can you love what doesn&#x2019;t love itself ? It is dangerous to take a border-dweller to bed.<br><br>The case of multiple murderer Jeffrey Dahmer is a stunning example of love distorted into the monstrous, as he was unable to love the men whom he wanted to love while they were conscious, while they were most <i>human</i>. It&#x2019;s an odd fact, according to psychiatrist Helen Morrison, that serial killers find it difficult to tell if a human being is alive or dead. This &#x2018;&#x2018;misunderstanding&#x2019;&#x2019; might be the most profound example of the shift from humanity to inhumanity on the part of these murderous border-dwellers. Or perhaps Dahmer&#x2019;s strong religious upbringing was so much at odds with his sexual preferences that hewas unable to have healthy sexual relationships. He opted instead to &#x2018;&#x2018;keep&#x2019;&#x2019; the men he brought home and ate. He took his <i>others</i> into himself through ingestion, trading one cultural taboo for another.&#x2018;&#x2018;Hitch-Hiker,&#x2019;&#x2019; a poem from Thom Gunn&#x2019;s <i>Troubadour</i> sequence that gives voice to Dahmer, expresses this grotesque romantic quandary: &#x2018;&#x2018;I know that I must keep you, and know how,/For I must hold the ribbed arch of your chest/And taste your boyish glow.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br>What was monstrous about Dahmer the human being was not visible to the naked eye. But had he been a character in a Shakespearean tragedy, rather than a quiet man working in a chocolate factory and walking the streets of America&#x2019;s midwest, he might have exhibited the impossible possibilities of the body, as do some of the monsters in this anthology. He might have sported a horn, or an extra leg, or a growth he shared with his conjoined twin. Or he might have been hybridized, like William Shakespeare&#x2019;s Caliban of <i>The Tempest</i>, the child splice of a witch and a devil: &#x2018;&#x2018;What have we here? a man or a fish?&#x2019;&#x2019; Shakespeare&#x2019;s Caliban recalls the humanesque forms of old, representing fears of what humans are capable of. These monsters are grotesques: exaggerations of ourselves descended from the creatures in the paintings in blood-thirsty Emperor Nero&#x2019;s dark grotto in ancient Rome. They are figures suffering incongruity, hybridity, doubleness, and metamorphosis, into which border-crossers Casanova and the Marquis de Sade couldn&#x2019;t resist carving the graffiti of their own names. Caliban&#x2019;s form would have been at home among these distorted forms in the dark underground.<br><br>Grotesques are often reversed images of the exaggerated forms of heroic and beautiful archetypes. The impossibly buff and sexy bodies of supermen and comic book beauties are distorted reflections of the grotesque forms of the villains they fight: Superman becoming dangerous in the shattered glass reflection is Bizarro Superman. Similarly, the act of exaggerating in monstrous poetry is sometimes a distorted reflection of the hyperbolic praise metaphors of heroic and love poetry. Thus, in Suzanne Lummis&#x2019; wonderfully irreverent take on the blason (the form of poetry in which the female is praised in pieces, body part by body part, through exaggerated comparisons), the lover&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;eyes [like] deep pools,&#x2019;&#x2019; rose cheeks, and ruby lips turn &#x2018;&#x2018;my love&#x2019;&#x2019; into &#x2018;&#x2018;my &#x2018;monster.&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x2019; When &#x2018;&#x2018;bees engage/the roses of your cheeks&#x2019;&#x2019; and &#x2018;&#x2018;Small/insects drown in those azure pools&#x2019;&#x2019; we laugh and the frustrated suitor weeps. The ideal <i>is</i> the monstrous, with just a shift of perspective.<br><br>Lummis&#x2019; portrait of a monstrous Shy Mistress and Shakespeare&#x2019;s description of Caliban remind us that monsters make for a lucrative circus. Humans cannot resist a peek at human physical possibility run amok. When they see themselves in the deformity, rest assured, they feel intensely, as we find in Alice Notley&#x2019;s marvelous and mythic <i>The Descent of Alette</i>, wherein the speaker believes she is watching her own head being detached from her body: &#x2018;&#x2018;I didn&#x2019;t&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2018;&#x2018;want to look&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2018;&#x2018;but&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2018;&#x2018;of course I had to.&#x2019;&#x2019; We know that we are up against the sublime when we are horrified but want to laugh, when we empathize but want to run.<br><br>So it is in Mariano Zaro&#x2019;s heart-wrenching poem &#x2018;&#x2018;Sireno /Merboy,&#x2019;&#x2019; a portrait of a boy with a skin condition, &#x2018;&#x2018;<i>Ichthyosis</i>,&#x2019;&#x2019; that makes him fishlike, point-headed, hairless, with white scaled skin that he asks the narrator to medicate. The narrator admits, &#x2018;&#x2018;There is something repulsive about it,/something that clogs the back of my throat,/but I keep rubbing his skin/as if I deserve the repulsion.&#x2019;&#x2019; This Merboy endures his humanity by poulticing the condition that makes him feel inhuman, cracked and scaled like a creature of the sea. He suffers from his metamorphosis and we cannot look away from that all-too-human pain.<br><br>Yet the Merboy is gentle, unlike other members of <i>homo oceanus</i> we have heard of, such as the sirens of Homer who cry fatally to bewitch men sailing by. Or consider Robert Lowell&#x2019;s mermaid, &#x2018;&#x2018;Rough Slitherer in your grotto of haphazard,&#x2019;&#x2019; a cruel portrait of his wife, Guinness heiress Lady Caroline Blackwood. Here is mermaid as drunken man-eater, whose monstrosity is directly proportional to the erotic power she wields. For female monsters, that which makes them monstrous is too often that which sets them apart from male expectations and desires. They are distorted in the mirror of the male gaze. Thus, like mermaids, witches are defined cosmetically. The witch is often presented as horrible because hideous &#x2013; the hag or the crone. Sometimes, though, as in the case of Circe, she is as beautiful as a goddess, and it&#x2019;s her willingness to assert her sexual power over men that is mythologized as devilish. As James Weldon Johnson puts it in &#x2018;&#x2018;The White Witch,&#x2019;&#x2019; a thinly veiled warning about race and sexuality at a time when sleeping with a Caucasian woman could get an African-American man lynched, &#x2018;&#x2018;Like nursery children you have looked/For ancient hag and snaggle-tooth;/But no, not so; the witch appears/In all the glowing charms of youth.&#x2019;&#x2019; But the White Witch&#x2019;s red lips burn, her golden hair binds, and her magnetic eyes suck out her lover&#x2019;s vital force. In the patriarchal tradition, the witch is evil because she steals the male prerogative of power.<br><br>This witch and all the witches in this collection have powers that frightened us when we were children and we encountered them in fairy tales. We all remember the story of a sister and brother sent away, heading toward peril in the form of a cannibalistic witch who lures children with her delicious house. She is surrounded by the other beasts in the tale: the quick-eyed ones with sharp beaks, and the very human monster who sent the children out into the darkwood in the first place. Pamela McClure alludes to a version of &#x2018;&#x2018;Hansel and Gretel&#x2019;&#x2019; in her &#x2018;&#x2018;Witch Lament,&#x2019;&#x2019; and she further complicates the old mythology by reminding her readers that the witchhas her problems, too. She&#x2019;s lonely, dwelling on the margins, a woman in exile. &#x2018;&#x2018;Her heart swings with the cage, loses its beat, left for dead/In some other tale, shoe dragging. What a hag.&#x2019;&#x2019; McClure&#x2019;s witch is a cannibal who still manages to be a sympathetic character. She reminds us that goodness (and evil) are sometimes situational. She is as sympathetic and menacing as Oriana Ivy&#x2019;s Baga Yaga: &#x2018;&#x2018;Here&#x2019;s the heart of a deer/killed in place of a young girl/<i>I forgive with it.</i>&#x2019;&#x2019; At the end of the poem, we learn that Ivy&#x2019;s witch is a border-dweller, too, one with two hearts, only one requiring love.<br><br>Ivy&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;Baba Yaga&#x2019;&#x2019; suggests that our human battles involve deadly trade-offs and that &#x2018;&#x2018;morality&#x2019;&#x2019; can be a relative term. A hall of monsters is a hall of mirrors. Is it necessarily a bad thing to be monstrous and to challenge morality? Friedrich Nietzsche&#x2019;s work seeks to liberate us from socially definedmorality by postulating that &#x2018;&#x2018;God is dead.&#x2019;&#x2019; He prefers the monstrous figure of a Cesare Borgia to that of the Arthurian hero Parsifal because at least Borgia acts upon his deepest instincts instead of denying them. For Nietzsche, in other words, to be <i>human</i> is to be in touch with our deep drives, what Freud would call the Id, and not to deny them in favor of socially prescribed moral restrictions. As William Blake puts it in &#x2018;&#x2018;The Garden of Love,&#x2019;&#x2019; when he finds that a Chapel has been built there: &#x2018;&#x2018;And the gates of this Chapel were shut,/And &#x2018;Thou shalt not&#x2019; writ over the door,&#x2019;&#x2019; and the flowers had turned to gravestones, &#x2018;&#x2018;And Priests in black gowns were walking their rounds, /And binding with briars my joys &amp; desires.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br>This introduction began with three questions: What is a monster? What does it mean to be inhuman? And what does it mean to be human? Are we human when we kill off our inner Calibans and Dahmers, our unholy, unhealthy desires and hungers &#x2013; or is that when we lose our human nature? Are we more human when we live in the mind as in a high white porcelain heaven, far removed from smut of lust and need of greed? Or does being human mean to be natural and unrepressed, to free our joys and desires from the priestly briars that bind them? Does it mean that we cast down the tyrannical superego and live unapologetically according to our natures (and kill our monster fathers)? Either way, we are living on the border. Robert Louis Stevenson&#x2019;s characters Jekyll and Hyde were the literary/physical embodiments of this human/inhuman quandary. Perhaps, as Jung had it, this vision of the self emerges from the primal split. It is the division between reason and yearning, mind and desire, good and evil, in the falling away from Edenic unity. Or it is the split from genderless unity intomale and female in Plato&#x2019;s genesis, where androgynous creatures were split into two by Zeus for trying to storm heaven. For Plato, all love &#x2013; whether lesbian, hetero- or homosexual &#x2013; comes from the desire of these split selves to meld into each other and find wholeness.<br><br>The hero, then, is the one called to heal this split world which is the split self. Thus the hero who descends into the underworld is really the self going down into the mind, and the winged, fanged, gibbering, firebreathing monsters the hero battles are manifestations of our repressed drives, drives that have turned exaggerated, distorted, monstrous because of the weight with which we have repressed them. And perhaps if we battle those monsters, we find the treasure that can heal the partial self and make it whole. The Jesus tale is one of many such descents in world religions and mythology (Inanna and Ishtar and Isis) designed to heal the spiritual split. As Plato puts it in the <i>Symposium</i>, &#x2018;&#x2018;the innate eros of humans . . . draws us to the primeval state&#x2019;&#x2019; that &#x2018;&#x2018;joins two into one, healing humanity&#x2019;s nature.&#x2019;&#x2019; Through love, the self can look boldly into the mirror and accept the reflection there as a necessary familiar. We are no longer partial beings dwelling on a psychological border. When we return to the light, we are transformed, made more human by battling and ultimately embracing as part of our humanity that which we called inhuman. As Prospero said of Caliban: &#x2018;&#x2018;this thing of darkness I acknowledge mine.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br>TONY BARNSTONE AND MICHELLE MITCHELL-FOUST</p><h2>YOUCAT Youth Catechism Catholic Church</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

Until it wasn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Samantha Bonner had just finished sweeping up. She&#x2019;d emptied the dustpan and sanitized the sink and wiped down the pastry case. The burned smell of coffee beans hung thick in the air, overpowering the vinegar solution she&#x2019;d run through the machines. But it was quiet. She stood for a moment and let the silence surround her, glad to be free of the acoustic-guitar music that had been looping through her head all day.<br> <br>Sam grabbed her purse and locked up. Crossing the rain-slicked parking lot to her car, she darted a look into all the dark corners. It was a safe neighborhood, but you never knew.<br> <br>She pulled out of the lot, relieved to be on her way home after pulling a double shift. Raindrops pitter-pattered on her windshield as she made her way through downtown. She switched the wipers to low, and her phone lit up with an incoming call. Amy.<br> <br>Sam stared down at the phone a moment. Then she put the call on speaker.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sam? Can you talk?&#x201d; Amy sounded undone. More than usual.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Jared. He wants to move back in.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He called you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He came by to drop off Aiden. I didn&#x2019;t let him in or anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sam didn&#x2019;t respond as she pulled up to a stoplight. In most areas, Amy wasn&#x2019;t a pushover. But her two-year-old boy missed his daddy, and his daddy knew it. He used the kid as leverage.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know what you&#x2019;re thinking,&#x201d; Amy said now. &#x201c;And I just want to talk through it, figure out what I&#x2019;m going to tell him. Can you come over for a bit? I can make us some coffee.&#x201d;<br> <br>The mere thought of coffee made Sam want to retch. &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; she said anyway. Amy was sniffling now, and Sam didn&#x2019;t have the heart to say no.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or we could talk on the phone,&#x201d; Amy said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re probably busy. Tonight&#x2019;s your night off, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I closed up.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sam slowed for a bend in the road. Stately oak trees and manicured lawns soon gave way to weeds and chain-link fences. Then came the railroad tracks. White-collar to blue in less than a mile. The people in Sam&#x2019;s neighborhood commuted to work at all hours and didn&#x2019;t stop for lattes on the way.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be over in a little.&#x201d; Sam turned onto her street. &#x201c;Give me twenty minutes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; Another sniffle.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d; Sam pulled into her driveway and rolled to a stop in the glow of her back-porch light.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, Sam. I mean it. I just need to hash this out. I mean, what if he&#x2019;s legit this time? I owe it to Aiden to at least think about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sam kept her skepticism to herself. For now. She slid from her car and noticed the white bike propped against her back deck as she walked up the driveway.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sam? You there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;<br> <br>She mounted the steps and spotted a blur of movement. Pain exploded at the base of her skull.<br> <br>Sam dropped to her knees and pitched forward. A big arm wrapped around her neck, hauling her back. The smell of tobacco registered in her brain, filling her with bone-deep fear as the arm clamped around her windpipe.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sam?&#x201d; Amy&#x2019;s voice was far away.<br> <br>Pain roared through Sam&#x2019;s skull. She struggled to move, to breathe. A glove-covered hand tipped her head back, exposing her neck.<br> <br>No.<br> <br>Sam clawed at the arm, trying desperately to buck, to kick, to scream for help. No, no, no! From the corner of her eye, she spied her phone on the ground. She tried to call out but the cries died in her throat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sam, are you there?&#x201d;<br> <br>Fear became panic as she saw the glint of a blade.<br> <br>&#x201c;Samantha?&#x201d;<br> <br>ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½<br> <br>Brooke Porter beat the detectives, which surprised her. But then again, she&#x2019;d made good time. When the message had come in coded 911, she&#x2019;d dropped what she was doing and rushed straight over.<br> <br>She parked beside a police unit and grabbed her evidence kit from the trunk as she surveyed the location. It was a small bungalow, like every other house on the block. In contrast to its neighbors, this home had a fresh coat of paint and looked to be in decent repair. Potted chrysanthemums lined the front stoop, where a uniformed officer stood taking shelter from the cold drizzle.<br> <br>Brooke darted up the sidewalk and ducked under the overhang. The officer was big. Huge. Brooke had met him before, but for the life of her, she couldn&#x2019;t remember his name.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jasper Miller,&#x201d; he provided, handing her a clipboard. &#x201c;Your photographer just got here.&#x201d;<br> <br>So, he knew she was with the Delphi Center. The San Marcos Police Department typically called Brooke&#x2019;s lab in to help with their big cases.<br> <br>Brooke scribbled her name into the scene log. &#x201c;You the first responder?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; He nodded at the driveway. &#x201c;Victim&#x2019;s around back. Looks like she was coming home from someplace, and he surprised her at the door.&#x201d;<br> <br>Brooke eyed the little white Kia parked in the driveway. She wanted to see things for herself and draw her own conclusions.<br> <br>&#x201c;Medical examiner&#x2019;s people got here about five minutes ago,&#x201d; Jasper added.<br> <br>&#x201c;And the detectives?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;On their way.&#x201d;<br> <br>She handed back the clipboard. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;<br> <br>Brooke picked her way across the stepping-stones in the grass, trying not to mar anything useful&#x2014;although the rain had already done a pretty good job of that. At the top of the driveway several uniforms stood under a blue Delphi Center tent that had been erected beside the back porch.<br> <br>Brooke&#x2019;s stomach tightened with nerves as she lifted the crime-scene tape and walked up the drive. She noted the chain-link fence, the thick shrubbery, the trash cans tucked against the one-car garage. Plenty of places for someone to hide.<br> <br>A camera flashed as she reached the tent. The Delphi Center photographer had already set up lights and started documenting the scene. Brooke unloaded some supplies from her kit. She zipped into coveralls and pulled booties over her shoes, then tugged on thick purple gloves as the uniforms looked on silently.<br> <br>Beat cops thought she was an oddity. She showed up at death scenes with her tweezers and her flashlights and her big orange goggles. She plucked bits of evidence from obscure places and then scuttled back to the lab to do her thing . . . whatever that was.<br> <br>The detectives got her. Well, maybe not totally. But they&#x2019;d at least learned to appreciate what she could do for them. Which ones had been assigned to this case? And where the hell were they?<br> <br>Brooke pulled her long dark hair into a ponytail. She picked up her evidence kit and sucked in a deep breath to brace herself before ducking under the tent to take her first look.<br> <br>Blood was everywhere.<br> <br>&#x201c;Holy God,&#x201d; she murmured.<br> <br>A woman lay crumpled at the back door, her neck slashed open to the bone. Her hair, her clothes, even the wooden decking beneath her, were saturated. Dark rivulets had dripped down the stairs and were now coagulating in little pools on the lower slats.<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch your step.&#x201d; She glanced up at the ME&#x2019;s assistant crouched beside the body. He was reading a thermometer and making notes on a pad. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s slippery.&#x201d;<br> <br>Brooked walked up the stairs and eased around him, taking care not to step in any puddles. Maddie Callahan stood beside the door, photographing a scarlet arc against the white siding.<br> <br>Arterial spray.<br> <br>She lowered her camera and glanced at Brooke. &#x201c;The detectives here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>The breeze shifted, and Brooke got a whiff of blood, strong and metallic. She glanced again at the gaping wound and stepped back to grab the wooden railing.<br> <br>Maddie looked at her. &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;<br> <br>Brooke should be immune to this stuff by now. But that neck.<br> <br>She steadied herself and looked around. A set of blood-spattered car keys lay near the victim&#x2019;s hand. Brooke glanced at the woman&#x2019;s face, partially visible beneath blood-matted blond hair. Brooke didn&#x2019;t see a weapon near the body. Any trail the killer might have left as he&#x2019;d fled the scene had likely been obscured by rain. The back door stood ajar. Had he fled through the house?<br> <br>She turned to the ME&#x2019;s assistant. &#x201c;Was this door open like this when you arrived?&#x201d;<br> <br>He glanced up, looking annoyed. &#x201c;Yes. We haven&#x2019;t been inside.&#x201d;<br> <br>Brooke turned to the victim again. Her head lolled weirdly to the side, and flies were already hovering despite the cool temperature. Brooke stepped past the ME&#x2019;s assistant and slipped into the house.<br> <br>She found herself in a dark utility room that smelled of fabric softener. The room was small but clean, without so much as a scrap of laundry on the floor. She switched on her flashlight and swept it around. No footprints.<br> <br>She stepped into the kitchen, maneuvering around an open pantry door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Was this open, too?&#x201d; she asked Maddie.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. And I haven&#x2019;t shot the kitchen yet, so don&#x2019;t move anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>Brooke stood still, giving herself a few moments to absorb the scene. She always tried to put herself in the perpetrator&#x2019;s shoes. Had he been in here? If so, what had he touched?<br> <br>The kitchen was dim except for a light above the sink. Using the end of her flashlight, Brooke flipped a switch beside the door, and an overhead fixture came on.<br> <br>No dirty dishes on the counter or food sitting out. Eighties-era appliances. A drying rack beside the sink contained a glass, a plate, and a fork. On the counter beside a microwave was a loose key and a stack of mail. She stepped over to read the name on the top envelope. Samantha Bonner.<br> <br>Brooke zeroed in on the key. It was bronze. Shiny. Unremarkable, except that it was sitting there all by itself.<br> <br>In the breakfast nook, a small wooden table was pushed up against a window. A brown bottle of root beer sat on the table unopened. Just below room temperature, judging from the condensation.<br> <br>Brooke returned her attention to the pantry. Soup, soup, and more soup, all Campbell&#x2019;s brand. It was like looking at an Andy Warhol painting. Chicken. Tomato. Cream of mushroom. The shelf above the soup was stocked with paper goods. The bottom shelf was filled with healthy cereals and gluten-free crackers and a package of those pink and white animal cookies with the colored sprinkles.<br> <br>&#x201c;Brooke?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; She leaned her head out to look at Maddie.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just finished shooting the back door if you want it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I definitely want it.&#x201d; Brooke returned to the utility room. She put on her orange goggles and switched her flashlight to ultraviolet, searching the floor for any fluids that might not be visible to the naked eye.<br> <br>Nothing.<br> <br>She examined the knob a moment, then selected a powder from her kit. On the porch outside, the ME&#x2019;s assistant was busy covering the victim&#x2019;s hands with paper bags for transport back to the morgue.<br> <br>Brooke glanced back at the kitchen, her attention drawn to the key again. It looked like a house key, and she wanted to know if it fit this door. But she couldn&#x2019;t touch it until Maddie finished her photos.<br> <br>Brooke opened the jar of powder and tapped some into a plastic tray. Using her softest brush, she loaded the bristles and then gently dusted the knob. She worked slowly, methodically. When she finished dusting, she cast her light over the fluorescent powder and was pleased to see a pristine thumbprint on the side of the knob.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maddie, can you get this for me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maddie stepped over and photographed the knob from several angles. When she finished, she moved into the kitchen with her camera.<br> <br>Brooked took out a strip of clear polyethylene tape and carefully lifted the thumbprint off the curved surface, taking care not to smudge it. She picked out a black card for contrast and gently placed the tape against the card.<br> <br>One lift done, probably a hundred to go. She closed her eyes a moment and inhaled deeply. When she got laser focused, she sometimes forgot to breathe.<br> <br>Brooke heard the detectives before she saw them&#x2014;two low male voices at the front of the house exchanging clipped police jargon.<br> <br>Sean Byrne and Ric Santos. She&#x2019;d know them anywhere.<br> <br>Brooke labeled the card and tucked it into her evidence kit. So, Sean and Ric on this one. They were experienced and observant. Sean noticed everything she did, even when he seemed to be interviewing witnesses or talking to other cops. He observed where she spent her time and how, and if she lingered in a particular spot, he always asked about it later.<br> <br>Brooke noticed him, too. With his athletic build and sly smile, it was hard not to. But mostly she noticed his attitude. He had an easygoing confidence she found attractive. Nothing ever seemed to rattle him.<br> <br>Of course, being a cop, he also had an ego.<br> <br>The voices grew louder as the detectives neared the kitchen. Brooke didn&#x2019;t look up, but she felt a jolt of awareness as Sean stepped into the room. His conversation stalled, and she could practically feel his gaze on her.<br> <br>ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½<br> <br>Sean watched Brooke for a moment, then turned to Jasper.<br> <br>&#x201c;You say the neighbor found her?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Lady let her dog out, and he started barking like crazy, so she went outside to see what was going on and spotted the victim in a pool of blood there on the porch. Name&#x2019;s Samantha Bonner. She works at a coffee shop.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sean raked his hand through his damp hair, scattering water on the floor. &#x201c;Married? Kids?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jasper shook his head. &#x201c;Neighbor says she lives alone.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sean unzipped his SMPD Windbreaker and glanced at Brooke again. She was on her knees by the back door, lifting fingerprints.

Do you experience a gap between what you say you believe and what you actually experience? Do you get frustrated when you&#x2019;re determined to change, you have a short blast of energy, and then you slide back to the status quo? Does success seem elusive or is there something you don&#x2019;t know? Does there seem to be a missing ingredient to success, prosperity, health, and abundant living? The answer is YES! And the road to real, lasting success starts in your heart. Author Ron McIntosh discovered that The Missing Ingredient &#x2013; The One Thing That Changes Everything isn&#x2019;t a self-help strategy, but revelation for thriving from the inside out.

The current threats to democracy are not just political: they are deeply embedded in the democracies of today, in current economic, social, and cultural conditions. In Crises of Democracy, Adam Przeworski presents a panorama of the political situation throughout the world of established democracies, places it in the context of past misadventures of democratic regimes, and speculates on the prospects. Our present state of knowledge does not support facile conclusions. &#39;We should not believe the flood of writings that have all the answers&#39;. Avoiding technical aspects, this book is addressed not only to professional social scientists, but to everyone concerned about the prospects of democracy.</p><p>Przeworski presents a panorama of not only the political threats to democracy, but also the current economic, social, and cultural threats, places them in the context of past crises of democratic regimes, and offers speculations about the prospects.

This new edition has expanded coverage of gawk (GNU awk), and includes sections on:</p><ul><li>An overview of sed and awk?s command line syntax</li><li>Alphabetical summaries of commands, including nawk and gawk</li><li>Profiling with pgawk</li><li>Coprocesses and sockets with gawk</li><li>Internationalization with gawk</li><li>A listing of resources for sed and awk users</li></ul>This small book is a handy reference guide to the information presented in the larger volumes. It presents a concise summary of regular expressions and pattern matching, and summaries of sed and awk.Arnold Robbins, an Atlanta native now happily living in Israel, is a professional programmer and technical author and coauthor of various O'Reilly Unix titles. He has been working with Unix systems since 1980, and currently maintains gawk and its documentation.</p><p>sed &amp; awk, one of the most popular books in O'Reilly &amp; Associates' Nutshell series, describes two text processing programs that are mainstays of the UNIX programmer's toolbox. sed is a "stream editor" for editing streams of text that might be too large to edit as a single file, or that might be generated on the fly as part of a larger data processing step. The most common operation done with sed is substitution, replacing one block of text with another. awk is a complete programming language. Unlike many conventional languages, awk is "data driven" -- you specify what kind of data you are interested in and the operations to be performed when that data is found. awk does many things for you, including automatically opening and closing data files, reading records, breaking the records up into fields, and counting the records. While awk provides the features of most conventional programming languages, it also includes some unconventional features, such as extended regular expression matching and associative arrays. sed &amp; awk describes both programs in detail and includes a chapter of example sed and awk scripts. This new edition covers features of sed and awk that are now mandated by the POSIX standard. This most notably affects awk, where POSIX standardized a new variable, CONVFMT, and new functions, toupper() and tolower(). The CONVFMT variable specifies the conversion format to use when converting numbers to strings (awk used to use OFMT for this purpose). The toupper() and tolower() functions each take a (presumably mixed case) string argument and return a new version of the string with all letters translated to the corresponding case. In addition, this edition covers GNU sed, newly available since the first edition. It also updates the first edition coverage of Bell Labs nawk and GNU awk (gawk), covers mawk, an additional freely available implementation of awk, and briefly discusses three commercial versions of awk, MKS awk, Thompson Automation awk (tawk), and Videosoft (VSAwk).The book begins with an overview and a tutorial that demonstrate a progression in functionality from grep to sed to awk. sed and awk share a similar command-line syntax, accepting user instructions in the form of a script. Because all three programs use UNIX regular expressions, an entire chapter is devoted to understanding UNIX regular expression syntax. Next, the book describes how to write sed scripts. After getting started by writing a few simple scripts, you&#39;ll learn other basic commands that parallel manual editing actions, as well as advanced commands that introduce simple programming constructs. Among the advanced commands are those that manipulate the hold space, a set-aside temporary buffer. The second part of the book has been extensively revised to include POSIX awk as well as coverage of three freely available and three commercial versions of awk. The book introduces the primary features of the awk language and how to write simple scripts. You&#39;ll also learn: common programming constructs; how to use awk&#39;s built-in functions; how to write user-defined functions; debugging techniques for awk programs; how to develop an application that processes an index, demonstrating much of the power of awk; and FTP and contact information for obtaining various versions of awk. Also included is a miscellany of user-contributed scripts that demonstrate a wide range of sed and awk scripting styles and techniques.</p><h2>The How-To Book for Students of Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy</h2><p>This is a book that grew out of the many practical &#34;how-to&#34; questions that the author&#39;s psychotherapy students have asked him over the years. It is neither an evidence-based compendium nor an attempt to summarize general practice or the viewpoints of others, but rather a handbook of practical answers to many of the questions that may puzzle students of psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. Some of the short chapters include: How to choose a personal psychoanalyst. How to do an initial interview. How to listen to a patient. How to recognize and understand self-states, multiple identities, true and false selves, etc. How to tell what the transference is. How to deal with the sadomasochistic transference. How to understand the need for recognition. How to think about analytic processHow to practice holistic healing. How to refer a patient for medication. How to get paid for your work. How to manage vacations, weekends, illnesses, no-shows and other disturbances of continuity.</p><p>Sheldon Bach, PhD, is Adjunct Clinical Professor of Psychology at the New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychoanalysis, a Training and Supervising Analyst at the New York Freudian Society, and a Fellow of the Institute for Psychoanalytic Training and Research and of the International Psychoanalytical Association. He is in private practice in New York City.&#x201c;This book is a little gem; words of practical wisdom by a master clinician. Sheldon Bach has long been regarded as an analyst&#x2019;s analyst, a voice of experience that transcends categorization into singular schools of thought. Here is his advice for the beginner, the fundamentals of clinical practice, of holistic healing, and of the therapist&#x2019;s own self-care.&#x201d;<br>Lewis Aron, PhD, Director (Post-Doctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis)<br><br>&#x201c;Dr Bach&#x2019;s book is perhaps the quintessential volume on how to proceed as a psychoanalytic therapist. It is, however, much more than that; it is a book that contains the wisdom of a master clinician delivered in a manner that is readily accessible at many different levels. On a first reading, one might think that, yes, this is very helpful and I am glad to have received this guidance. On a second reading, one begins to realize that a view of psychoanalysis is subtly inculcated in the text and that the depth and scope of the material stirs one to consider some of the basic concepts in our field in a new light. It is a book for the young clinician to help them begin to find their way, and a book for older clinicians to help them more fully understand the pathways that they have traversed." (Steven J. Ellman, Professor Emeritus, City University of New York; Faculty and Supervisor, Post-Doctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis)</p><h2>Psychological Science and the Law</h2><p>Psychological research can provide constructive explanations of key problems in the criminal justice system--and can help generate solutions. This state-of-the-art text dissects the psychological processes associated with fundamental legal questions: Is a suspect lying? Will an incarcerated individual be dangerous in the future? Is an eyewitness accurate? How can false memories be implanted? How do juries, experts, forensic examiners, and judges make decisions, and how can racial and other forms of bias be minimized? Chapters offer up-to-date reviews of relevant theory, experimental methods, and empirical findings. Specific recommendations are made for improving the quality of evidence and preserving the integrity of investigative and legal proceedings.</p><p>Neil Brewer, PhD, is Matthew Flinders Distinguished Emeritus Professor of Psychology at Flinders University, South Australia. He is a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science and of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia. His research addresses eyewitness identification and recall, juror judgments, and, recently, interactions between individuals with autism spectrum disorder and the justice system. Dr. Brewer has served as the editor of the<i> Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied</i> and as an editorial board member for all the major psychology&#x2013;law journals.<br> &nbsp;<br> Amy Bradfield Douglass, PhD, is Professor of Psychology at Bates College. She teaches statistics and upper-level courses on psychology and law and psychology of religion. Her research focuses on how eyewitnesses make decisions, how eyewitness errors can be prevented, how social interactions with lineup administrators affect retrospective witness judgments, and how people perceive and evaluate eyewitnesses. Dr. Douglass is an editorial board member and former associate editor of<i> Law and Human Behavior</i>."We live at a time when psychological research in matters of social justice has never been so sorely needed. This text satisfies today's high demand for forensic psychology in the courts and in the college classroom. With up-to-date chapters written by active scholars, the book spans a range of sizzling topics--criminal profiling, lie detection, police interrogations and confessions, eyewitness memory, bias in the forensic sciences, judicial and jury decision making, plea bargaining, psychopathy, and what it means to be competent to stand trial."--Saul Kassin, PhD, Distinguished Professor of Psychology, John Jay College of Criminal Justice, City University of New York<br><br> "If you have ever been curious about the deep connection between psychology and law, this is the book for you. Two eminent researchers have assembled a stellar group of scientists and scholars to fill readers in on the latest on eyewitness memory, judicial decision making, expert testimony, and a host of other topics. I felt immense pride when reading of the myriad ways psychology has contributed to solving some of the most vexing problems in our system of justice. You can see that for yourself, whether you&#x2019;re learning about it for the first time or have been following the literature for years."--Elizabeth F. Loftus, PhD, Distinguished Professor of Social Ecology, and Professor of Law, and Cognitive Science, University of California, Irvine<br><br> "Brewer and Douglass have really hit the mark with this excellent, up-to-date work. A wide array of topics are covered, from traditional social and cognitive research related to eyewitness memory to more clinically based areas such as forensic interviewing and the assessment of competence. The book tackles emerging areas of research and practice that are not included in other texts, such as issues related to plea bargaining, cognitive bias in forensic decision making, and the pseudoscience of criminal profiling. Highly readable, this is an outstanding text for upper-level courses in psychology and law; it will also be useful for professionals in the criminal justice system."--Mitchell Eisen, PhD, Professor and Director, Forensic Psychology Graduate Program, California State University, Los Angeles<br><br> &#x201c;Prominent scholars provide thorough summaries of the literature in each of the major domains of scholarship in psychology and law. Accessible, critical, and engaging, this text will be of great value to students, practitioners, and researchers--it fills a gap in the field."--Michael E. Lamb, PhD, Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom; Editor, <i>Psychology, Public Policy, and Law</i><br><br> "This beautifully crafted text provides a comprehensive, up-to-date discussion of contemporary debates and issues at the interface of psychology and criminal law. Readers learn how social, cognitive, clinical and forensic psychology inform a broad range of processes within criminal justice systems. Each chapter is written by one or more experts at the cutting edge of their respective fields who understand the benefits and challenges of translating science into practice. This is a worthy successor to Brewer and Williams's 2005 <i>Psychology and Law,</i> which has informed my teaching and research for over a decade. It will doubtless be regarded as the authoritative work on psychological science and the law for students, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers."--Kimberley A.

This peppermint stick is "long. And striped. And thin. And sweet." And it's all hers. But then along comes Sheila Rae's little sister, Louise, hankering for some of that spicy sweetness. "Please?" she says, ever so hopefully. Sheila Rae, in the quintessential way of big sisters, proceeds to taunt, torment, and tease her younger sibling. "You can have one lick if you can guess how many stripes there are." Smugly, she waits for Louise's answer of "Thirteen-seven." Readers of the earlier Sheila Rae title will not be too surprised to see this mouse heroine get her comeuppance once again, and everyone will rejoice at the happy, win-win finale.<p> Kevin Henkes, creator of <i>Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse</i> and many other award-winning and beloved picture books, creates a charming pair of characters in this simple, very amusing story with a familiar theme.

Bill Gates, Bono, and Laura Bush are only a few of the personalities who have lent their names--and opened their pocketbooks--in hopes of stopping the disease. Still, in a time when every emergent disease inspires waves of panic, why aren't we doing more to tame one of our oldest foes? And how does a pathogen that we've known how to prevent for more than a century still infect 500 million people every year, killing nearly one million of them?&nbsp;<br> In The Fever, journalist Sonia Shah sets out to answer those questions, delivering a timely, inquisitive chronicle of the illness and its influence on human lives. Through the centuries, she finds, we've invested our hopes in a panoply of drugs and technologies, and invariably those hopes have been dashed. From the settling of the New World to the construction of the Panama Canal, through wartimes and the advances of the Industrial Revolution, Shah tracks malaria's jagged ascent and the tragedies in its wake, revealing a parasite every bit as persistent as the insects that carry it.&nbsp; With distinguished prose and original reporting from Panama, Malawi, Cameroon, India, and elsewhere,&nbsp;The Fever captures the curiously fascinating, devastating history of this long-standing thorn in the side of humanity.<br></p><p>Sonia Shah is a science journalist and prize-winning author. Her writing on science, politics, and human rights&nbsp;has appeared in the New York Times,&nbsp;the Wall Street Journal,&nbsp;Foreign Affairs,&nbsp;Scientific American&nbsp;and elsewhere. Her&nbsp;work&nbsp;has been featured on Fresh Air, RadioLab, and&nbsp;TED, where her talk, "Three Reasons We Still Haven't Gotten Rid of Malaria" has been viewed by over 1,000,000 people around the world.&nbsp;<br> Her 2010 book,&nbsp;The Fever, which was called a "tour-de-force history of malaria" (New York Times), "rollicking" (Time), and "brilliant" (Wall Street Journal), was long-listed for the&nbsp;Royal Society's Winton Prize, the world's most prestigious prize for science writing.<p>The view through the mosquito net is blurry, but I can see the</p><p>thick skin of grime on the leading edge of each blade of the</p><p>ceiling fan as it slowly whirs around, keening alarmingly.</p><p>This is how it was every summer when I visited my grandmother&#x2019;s</p><p>house in southern India. While my cousins snore on the bed mats</p><p>laid across the floor beside me, glistening bodies bathed in the warm</p><p>night breeze, my sleeping mat is ensconced in a hot, gauzy cage. The</p><p>mosquitoes descend from the darkened corners of the whitewashed</p><p>room and perch menacingly on the taut netting, ready to exploit any</p><p>fl icker of movement from their prey within. It is hard to fall asleep</p><p>knowing they are there, watching me, but eventually I drop off and</p><p>my tensed body uncurls. They sneak into the gaps my protruding</p><p>limbs create, and feast.</p><p>In the morning, all my hard work of trying to fi t in, to overcome</p><p>the Americanness of my suburban New England life, has been</p><p>undone, for my Indian cousins are smooth and brown while I am</p><p>speckled with bleeding scabs. My grandmother vigorously pats talcum</p><p>powder over my wounds, the white powder caking pink with</p><p>congealed blood, as my cousins snicker. I don&#x2019;t understand how they</p><p>escape unscathed while I am tormented. But incomprehension is part </p><p>of the package of these childhood summers in India. Just outside my</p><p>grandmother&#x2019;s house ragged families huddle in rubble along the road</p><p>and use the train tracks as their toilet. They wave their sticklike arms</p><p>in my face and moan woefully when we pass by on the way to temple,</p><p>caricatures of beggars. One boy&#x2019;s leg has swollen to the size of a log,</p><p>and is gray and pimpled, from some disease brought on by a mosquito</p><p>bite. My grandmother tightens her grip on my hand. We give</p><p>the children nothing. I can&#x2019;t understand this, either. When we get to</p><p>the white marble temple, it is full of incense and golden statues</p><p>encrusted with diamonds and rubies&#x2014;to my seven-year-old mind,</p><p>the very picture of prosperity.</p><p>Part of me despises my estrangement, my incomprehension, the</p><p>fact that I must sleep under the suffocating net and take the malaria</p><p>pills while my cousins don&#x2019;t. But part of me is secretly glad. The boy</p><p>with the swollen leg frightens me. The family who lives on the curb</p><p>frightens me. India frightens me. These fears, for the girl who is supposed</p><p>to be Indian but isn&#x2019;t, are unspeakable.</p><p>When no one is looking, I crush the mosquitoes&#x2019; poised little</p><p>figures with my palm and smear the remains on a hidden seam in</p><p>the couch. Our Jain religion forbids violence of any kind. No eating</p><p>meat. No swatting flies. My grandmother wears a mask over her</p><p>mouth while she prays, to protect airborne microbes from inadvertent</p><p>annihilation in her inhalations, and considers walking on</p><p>blades of grass a sin. Meanwhile, there I am in the corner, cravenly</p><p>pulverizing mosquito corpses behind my back, blood literally on</p><p>my hands.</p><p>Back home in New England, the mosquitoes still bite, but there</p><p>are no nets at night, no pills to take, no scary beggars on the side of</p><p>the road. We shop for forgettable plastic trinkets at the mall. My fear</p><p>and loathing of the mosquito are blunted into games of tag. My father</p><p>calls himself Giant Mosquito, undulates his fingers like proboscises</p><p>and chases me and my sister. It&#x2019;s scary, but fun-scary. We screech</p><p>with glee and stampede through the house. </p><p>ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½</p><p>Thirty years later, on the S-shaped land bridge between the North</p><p>and South American continents, I meet Josï¿½ Calzada. Calzada is a</p><p>mosquito stalker of sorts, and I, the mosquito hater, have come to</p><p>learn about the local mosquitoes and their exploits. A parasitologist</p><p>from Panama City, Panama, Calzada spends his time rushing to the</p><p>scene of disease outbreaks across the isthmus. The mosquito-borne</p><p>parasite that causes malaria, <em>Plasmodium</em>, is one of his specialties.</p><p>It is April 2006. For most of the past century, there hasn&#x2019;t been</p><p>much work in this fi eld for people such as Calzada. Panama prides</p><p>itself on being one of just a handful of tropical developing countries</p><p>to have tamed its mosquitoes and nearly conquered malaria. American</p><p>military engineers built a canal through Panama in the early</p><p>1900s, and forced malaria to retreat to the remote fringes of the</p><p>country. Since then it has stagnated, primarily in its most benign</p><p>incarnation, vivax malaria, which is rarely fatal.</p><p>But things have changed in recent years, and Calzada has agreed</p><p>to show me some obscure signs. He emerges from the imposing</p><p>Gorgas Memorial Institute, Panama&#x2019;s sole health research center.</p><p>Clean-shaven and trim, Calzada has a slightly worried look in his</p><p>eyes that is off set by high cheekbones suggesting a perpetual halfsmile.</p><p>I wait while he meticulously changes out of his work clothes&#x2014;</p><p>button-down oxford shirt and slacks&#x2014;and into a T-shirt and jeans.</p><p>Climbing into my diminutive white rental car and tossing a baseball</p><p>cap on top of his backpack in the backseat, he patiently directs me</p><p>out of the labyrinthine metropolis. Navigating Panama City&#x2019;s congested</p><p>streets, past shiny skyscrapers and packed cafï¿½s, is a task that</p><p>challenges even my well-honed Boston driv ing skills.</p><p>After twenty minutes heading east out of the city, the road turns</p><p>quiet. It&#x2019;s a lovely drive, with hills in the distance, verdant pasture</p><p>and scrub unbroken save for a few elaborately gated houses set far</p><p>back from the road. Colombian drug lords, Calzada says, by way of </p><p>explanation. Another hour passes, and the road rises, a glittering</p><p>lake coming into view, just visible through a tangle of jungle. As we</p><p>near the water, the pavement ends, and we pull over.</p><p>Here, at the end of the road, is the town of Chepo. From what I</p><p>can see, it consists of a wooden lean-to facing a sleepy roadside cafï¿½.</p><p>Two police officers amble out of the lean-to, which turns out to be a</p><p>checkpoint. They take my passport and vanish, leaving Calzada and</p><p>me to buy a cold drink at the near-empty cafï¿½. As we sit, I can just</p><p>make them out in the murk within the lean-to, inspecting the blue</p><p>passport with great care, turning it over and over in their hands as if</p><p>for clues to some baffling mystery.</p><p>Inspection completed, Calzada leads us on foot behind the road.</p><p>Th e hillside is green and lush, with a slick red clay track leading to</p><p>the crest. He heads up and I follow gingerly.</p><p>At the top of the hill lies an improb able settlement. Packed</p><p>together, not ten feet apart, are dozens of hand-built ranchos, their</p><p>thatched roofs sitting on top of roughly hewn wooden poles. More</p><p>arbor than hut, some of the structures rest on concrete slabs, with</p><p>airy wooden-slat walls on three sides, but most are fully open-air,</p><p>situated directly on the packed dirt. Inside the ranchos, smoldering</p><p>fi res are encircled by battered metal cooking vats, parrots sit on overturned</p><p>baskets, and hammocks sway from high rafters.</p><p>From the road, Chepo seems abandoned, but in fact, three hundred</p><p>of Panama&#x2019;s indigenous Kuna people live here, tucked away.</p><p>It starts to rain, and we duck under the eaves of a rancho. Women</p><p>pass to and fro in bright puff ed-sleeve cotton blouses with patterned </p><p><em>molas </em>tied around their waists and elaborate beaded anklets that</p><p>reach up to their calves. They are cutting plantains, carrying plump</p><p>naked children. One puts out a giant metal vat to collect the rainwater</p><p>sliding off the thatch. A rooster strides by purposefully.</p><p>A half-dozen boys clad in saggy cotton underwear and wearing</p><p>shell necklaces happily kick a defl ated green soccer ball. One boy,</p><p>around eight years old and wearing cracked red plastic flip-flops,</p><p>gnaws on a green mango pit while absentmindedly pulling on his </p><p>penis. A little girl walks by holding a baby covered in a rash, whom</p><p>she hands to me easily. It is a tranquil scene, earthy and ripe, this</p><p>hidden place at the end of the road.</p><p>It is soon apparent that most of the residents are in one of the</p><p>larger ranchos, sitting around a smoky fire. Peeking in, we see them</p><p>singing softly and dancing. A few are sprawled on the clay floor,</p><p>facedown, passed out. We&#x2019;ve arrived in the midst of a fiesta, Calzada</p><p>whispers to me. A local girl has recently menstruated for the fi rst</p><p>time, and so the community has spent the day drinking <em>chicha fuerte</em>,</p><p>a brew made from fermented corn. As we watch, a woman and a</p><p>boy lift a comatose mud-caked man off the ground and drag him</p><p>home. Two women from inside the rancho follow them to the doorway,</p><p>smiling. Aside from a few furtive looks, they ignore us almost</p><p>entirely.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t like this the year before, when Calzada first came here.</p><p>There is no En glish-language record of what happened to Chepo&#x2019;s</p><p>Kuna community in 2005, save the one you are reading now. The</p><p>mosquitoes that hatched from Chepo&#x2019;s stagnant puddles, the edges</p><p>of the lake below, in the open-water cisterns, had gone on a rampage.</p><p>Contaminated with the most malevolent malaria parasites known to</p><p>humankind in their spittle, they alit on the exposed and unclad Kuna</p><p>around them. By the time Calzada and his team arrived, nearly half</p><p>of the settlement was fevered, terrified, immobilized in their hammocks.</p><p>After days of triage, Calzada brought samples of the Kuna&#x2019;s infected</p><p>blood back to his lab at the Gorgas Institute to analyze. The</p><p>most common malaria in this part of Panama is the relativ...</p></p><h2>The Great Migration: Journey to the North</h2><p><p><em>We were one family among the many thousands.

And yet thousands of years later Christians continue to disagree on what this involves. Some believe that the focus of Christian mission is evangelizing and "saving souls." Others emphasize global justice issues or relief and development work. Is either view correct on its own? John Stott's classic book presents an enduring and holistic view of Christian mission that is just as needed today. Newly updated and expanded by Christopher J. H. Wright, <em>Christian Mission in the Modern World</em> provides a biblically based approach to mission that addresses both spiritual and physical needs. With his trademark and unparalleled clarity and conviction, Stott illuminates how the Great Commission itself not only assumes the proclamation that makes disciples, but also teaches obedience to the Great Commandment of love and service. Wright has expertly updated the original book and demonstrates the continuing relevance of Stott's prescient thinking. This balanced approach to mission offers timeless guidance for current and future Christians to embrace Jesus' unconflicted and holistic model of ministry.</p><p>John R. W. Stott (1921-2011) has been known worldwide as a preacher, evangelist and communicator of Scripture. For many years he served as rector of All Souls Church in London, where he carried out an effective urban evangelistic and pastoral ministry. A leader among evangelicals in Britain, the United States and around the world, Stott was a principal framer of the landmark Lausanne Covenant (1974). His many books, including <em>Why I Am a Christian</em> and <em>The Cross of Christ</em>, have sold millions of copies around the world.<br><br>Christopher J. H. Wright is the international ministries director of the Langham Partnership, providing literature, scholarships and preaching training for pastors in Majority World churches and seminaries. He has written several books including <em>Old Testament Ethics for the People of God</em>, <em>The Mission of God</em> and <em>Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament</em>. He was chair of the Lausanne Theology Working Group from 2005 to 2011 and the chief architect of The Cape Town Commitment from the Third Lausanne Congress (2010). An ordained pastor in the Church of England, Wright also serves on staff at All Souls Church."John Stott's <em>Christian Mission in the Modern World</em> is a small classic and remains surprisingly relevant for today. And no one is more qualified than Chris Wright to bring the discussion up-to-date&#x2015;to expand, reframe and even sometimes disagree with Stott's work on certain issues within the evangelical and biblical commitment shared by both. This will prove to be an excellent basic introduction to mission and evangelism, along with providing a biblical understanding of salvation, dialogue and conversion for Christian mission. But it will also be a helpful guide to how evangelical thinking on mission has developed in the past four decades by two of its premier exponents." (Michael W. Goheen, author of Introducing Christian Mission Today and A Light to the Nations)<br><br>"This Stott classic has been ably updated and expanded by Christopher J. H. Wright. In fact, this volume is double the size of the old edition as Wright follows each Stott chapter with one of his own. . . . This is top flight title on Christian Mission and I recommend it."

They take over the sky and hide that pulsing swollen moon that is clearing its throat above them. The slow trickle of its light is there&#x2014;but any possible glimmer is hidden, invisible behind the clouds that have rolled in low and bloated and so very full. Soon the clouds will open up and pour down a heavy summer rain, so very soon, because they, too, are full of what they must do, full to the point of bursting, so very full that they, too, must work to hold back the flood that absolutely must come, and soon.<br> &nbsp;<br> Soon&#x2014;but not now, not yet. They must wait, too, swelling with the power of all that is growing in them, the true and blinding cur- rent of what will come, of what must come when it is right, when it is beyond necessary and into the true shape of this moment, when it forges the real and necessary skeleton of <i>now</i>&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> But that time is not yet here, not yet. And so the clouds glower and bunch and wait, letting the need build, and the tension grows with it. It will be soon; it has to be soon. In only a few moments these dark and silent clouds will shatter the silence of the night with the unbearable bright omnipotence of their might and blast the darkness into flickering shards&#x2014;and then, only then, the release will come.<br> &nbsp;<br> The clouds will open up and all the tension of holding in so much weight will flow out in the pure bliss of letting go, and the clean joy of it will pour out and flood the world with its oh-so-happy gift of light and liberation.<br> &nbsp;<br> That moment is near, so tantalizingly close&#x2014;but it is not yet. And so the clouds wait for that just-right moment, growing their darkness, swelling even bigger and heavier with shadow, until they absolutely must let go.<br> &nbsp;<br> And here below, in the lightless night? Here on the ground, in the stark pool of shadow these clouds have made with their moon-sheltering sky-hogging sulkiness? What can this be, over there, skyless and dark, sliding through the night so very full and ready and waiting, just like the clouds? And it is waiting, whatever its dark self might be; it waits tense and coiled and watching for that perfect moment to do what it will, what it must, what it has always done. And that moment skitters closer on little mice feet as if it too knows what must come and fears it, and feels the terror of the stalking moment of rightness that is even now pattering up close, closer&#x2014;until it is right there behind you, looking at your neck and nearly tasting the warm flutter of those tender veins and thinking, <i>Now</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> And a shattering blast of lightning shreds the dark night and shows a large and soft-looking man scuttling across the ground, as if he, too, has felt the dark breath so close behind. Thunder booms and lightning flashes again and the figure is closer, juggling a laptop and a manila folder as he fumbles for keys and disappears into darkness again as the lightning ends. One more burst of lightning; the man is very close now, clutching his burden and holding a car key in the air. And he is gone again in black stillness. There is sudden silence, a complete hush, as if nothing anywhere is breathing and even the darkness is holding its breath&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> And then there comes a sudden rush of wind and a last hammer of thunder and the whole world cries out, <i>Now</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Now</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> And all that must happen in this dark summer night begins to happen. The skies open up and let go of their burden, the world begins to breathe again, and here in the newly wet darkness other tensions flex and uncoil so very slowly, carefully, reaching their soft sharp tendrils out toward the fumbling, clownlike figure now scrabbling to unlock his car in this sudden rain. The car&#x2019;s door swings open, the laptop and folder thump onto the seat, and then the soft and doughy man slides in behind the wheel, slams the door, and takes a deep breath as he wipes the water from his face. And he smiles, a smile of small triumph, something he does a lot these days. Steve Valentine is a happy man; things have gone his way a lot lately and he thinks they have gone his way again tonight. For Steve Valentine, life is very good.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is also almost over.<br> &nbsp;<br> Steve Valentine is a clown. Not a buffoon, not a happy caricature of inept normality. He is a real clown, who runs ads in the local papers and hires out for children&#x2019;s parties. Unfortunately, it is not the bright laughter of childish innocence that he lives for, and his sleight of hand has gotten somewhat out of hand. He has been arrested and released twice when parents pointed out to the police that you don&#x2019;t really need to take a child into a dark closet to show him balloon animals.<br> &nbsp;<br> They had to let him go both times for lack of evidence, but Valentine took the hint; from that point on nobody has complained&#x2014;how could they? But he has not stopped entertaining the children, certainly not. Leopards do not change their spots, and Valentine has not changed his. He just got wiser, darker, as wounded predators do. He has moved on into a more permanent game and he thinks he has found a way to play and never pay.<br> &nbsp;<br> He is wrong. <br> Tonight the bill comes due. <br> Valentine lives in a run-down apartment building just north of Opa-locka airport. The building looks at least fifty years old. Abandoned cars litter the street in front, some of them burned-out. The building shakes slightly when corporate jets fly low overhead, landing or taking off, and that sound interrupts the constant white noise of traffic on the nearby expressway.<br> &nbsp;<br> Valentine&#x2019;s apartment is on the second floor, number eleven, and it has a very good view of a rotting playground with a rusting jungle gym, a tilting slide, and a basketball hoop with no net. Valentine has put a battered lawn chair on the balcony of his apartment, placed so he has a perfect view of the playground. He can sit and sip a beer and watch the children play and think his happy thoughts about playing with them.<br> &nbsp;<br> And he does. He has played with at least three young boys that we know about and probably more. In the last year and a half small bodies have been pulled from a nearby canal on three occasions. They had been sexually abused and then strangled. The boys were all from this neighborhood, which means that their parents are poor and probably in this country illegally. That means that even when their children were killed they had very little to say to the police&#x2014;and that makes their children perfect targets for Valentine. Three times, at least, and the police have no leads.<br> &nbsp;<br> But we do. We have more than a lead. We <i>know</i>. Steve Valentine watched those little boys at their games on the playground, and then he followed them away into the dusk and taught them his own very final games and then he put them into the murky trash-filled water of the canal. And he went satisfied back to his decrepit lawn chair, opened a beer, and watched the playground for a new little friend.<br> &nbsp;<br> Valentine thought he was very clever. He thought he had learned his lesson and found a better way to live out his dreams and make a home for his alternative lifestyle and there was nobody smart enough to catch him and make him stop. Until now he has been right.<br> &nbsp;<br> Until tonight.<br> &nbsp;<br> Valentine had not been in his apartment when the cops came to investigate the three dead boys, and that was not luck. That was part of his predator&#x2019;s cleverness; he has a scanner for listening to police radio traffic. He knew when they were in the area. It would not be often. The police did not like to come to neighborhoods like this one, where the best they could hope for was hostile indifference. That is one reason Valentine lives here. But when the cops do come, he knows about it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The cops come if they have to, and they have to if Somebody calls 911 to report a couple fighting in apartment eleven on the second floor, and if Somebody says the fight ended suddenly with the sound of screaming terror followed by silence, they come quickly.<br> &nbsp;<br> And when Valentine hears them on his scanner, coming to his address, to his apartment, he will naturally want to be sure he is somewhere else before they get here. He will take any material he has that hints at his hobby&#x2014;and he will have some material, they always do&#x2014;and he will hurry downstairs and out into the darkness to his car, thinking that he can drive away until the radio tells him that things have calmed down again.<br> &nbsp;<br> He will not think that Someone would bother to look up his car&#x2019;s registration and know that he drives a light blue twelve-year-old Chevrolet Blazer with <i>Choose Life!</i> plates on it and a magnetic sign on the door that says, <i>Puffalump the Clown</i>. And he will not think that Something might be waiting for him in the backseat of this car, hunched down carefully into the shadows.<br> &nbsp;<br> He will be wrong about both of those things. Someone does know his car, and Something does wait silently hunkered down on the floor of the dark backseat of the old Chevy, waits while Valentine finishes wiping his face and smiling his secret smile of small triumph and finally&#x2014;<i>finally</i>&#x2014;puts the key in the ignition and starts the engine.<br> &nbsp;<br> And as the car sputters into life, the moment comes, suddenly, <i>finally</i>, and Something roars up and out of the darkness and snakes a blinding-fast loop of fifty-pound-test nylon fishing line around Valentine&#x2019;s doughy neck and pulls it tight before he can say anything more than, &#x201c;Guck&#x2014;!&#x201d; and he begins to flail his arms in a stupid, weak, pitiful way that makes Someone feel the cold contemptuous power running up the nylon line and deep into the hands holding it. And now the smile has melted from Valentine&#x2019;s face and flowed instead onto ours and we are there so close behind him that we can smell his fear and hear the terrified thumping of his heart and feel his lack of breath and this is <i>good</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You belong to us now,&#x201d; we tell him, and our Command Voice hits him like a jolt of the lightning that crackles outside now to punctuate the darkness. &#x201c;You will do just what we say and you will do it only when we say it.&#x201d; And Valentine thinks he has something to say about that and makes a small wet sound and so we pull the noose tight, very tight, just for a moment, so he will know that even his breath belongs to us. His face goes dark and his eyes bulge out and he raises his hands to his neck and his fingers scrabble madly at the noose for a few seconds until everything goes dark for him and his hands slide down into his lap and he slumps forward and begins to fade away and so we ease up on the noose because it is still too soon, much too soon for him.<br> &nbsp;<br> His shoulders move and he makes a sound like a rusty ratchet as he takes in one more breath, one more in the quickly dwindling number of breaths he has left to him, and because he does not yet know that the number is so very small he takes another quickly, a little easier, and he straightens up and wastes his precious air by croaking, &#x201c;What the fuck!&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> A string of nasty mucus drips from his nose and his voice sounds cramped and raspy and very irritating and so we pull once more on the noose, a little more gently this time, just enough so he will know that we own him now, and he very obediently gapes and clutches at his throat and then goes silent. &#x201c;No talking,&#x201d; we say. &#x201c;Drive.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He looks up and into the rearview mirror and his eyes meet ours for the very first time&#x2014;only the eyes, showing cool and dark through the slits cut in the sleek silk hood that covers our face. For just a moment he thinks he will say something and we twitch the noose very gently, just enough to remind him, and he changes his mind. He looks away from the mirror, puts the car in gear, and drives.<br> &nbsp;<br> We steer him carefully south, encouraging him now and then with small tugs on the noose, just to keep that one thought in his mind that even breathing is not automatic and will not happen unless we say so, and he is very good for most of the trip. Only one time at a stoplight does he look back at us in the mirror and clear his throat and say, &#x201c;What are you&#x2014;where are we going?&#x201d; and we pull very hard on his leash for a long moment and let his world go dim.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We are going where you are told to go,&#x201d; we say. &#x201c;Just drive, and do not talk, and you might live a little longer.&#x201d; And that is enough to make him behave, because he does not yet know that soon, so very soon, he will not <i>want</i> to live a little longer, because living as he will come to know it is a very painful thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> We steer him carefully along side streets and into an area of battered newer houses. Many of them are empty, foreclosed, and one of them in particular has been selected and prepared and we drive Valentine to this place, down a quiet street and under a broken streetlight and into an old-fashioned carport attached to this house and we make him park the car at the back of the carport, where it cannot be seen from the road, and turn off the engine.</p><h2>500 Years of Chicana Women&#39;s History / 500 Aï¿½os de la Mujer Chicana: Bilingual Edition</h2><p>Named the 2009 AAUP Best of the Best - Outstanding Book Distinction<br><br>The history of Mexican Americans spans more than five centuries and varies from region to region across the United States. Yet most of our history books devote at most a chapter to Chicano history, with even less attention to the story of Chicanas. <br><br><i>500 Years of Chicana Women&#x2019;s History </i>offers a powerful antidote to this omission with a vivid, pictorial account of struggle and survival, resilience and achievement, discrimination and identity. The bilingual text, along with hundreds of photos and other images, ranges from female-centered stories of pre-Columbian Mexico to profiles of contemporary social justice activists, labor leaders, youth organizers, artists, and environmentalists, among others.&nbsp; With a distinguished, seventeen-member advisory board, the book presents a remarkable combination of scholarship and youthful appeal. <br><br>In the section on jobs held by Mexicanas under U.S. rule in the 1800s, for example, readers learn about flamboyant Doï¿½a Tules, who owned a popular gambling saloon in Santa Fe, and Eulalia Arrilla de Pï¿½rez, a respected curandera (healer) in the San Diego area. Also covered are the &#x201c;repatriation&#x201d; campaigns&#x201d; of the Midwest during the Depression that deported both adults and children, 75 percent of whom were U.S.&#x2013;born and knew nothing of Mexico. Other stories include those of the garment, laundry, and cannery worker strikes, told from the perspective of Chicanas on the ground.<br><br>From the women who fought and died in the Mexican Revolution to those marching with their young children today for immigrant rights, every story draws inspiration. Like the editor&#x2019;s previous book, <i>500 Years of Chicano History</i> (still in print after 30 years), this thoroughly enriching view of Chicana women&#x2019;s history promises to become a classic.</p><p>Elizabeth "Betita" Martï¿½nez is a widely known Chicana writer, activist, and lecturer.

According to the U.N., every human&#x2013;just by virtue of being human&#x2013;is entitled to freedom, a fair government, a decent standard of living, work, play, and education, freedom to come and go as we please and to associate with anyone we please, and the right to express ourselves freely. <i>Every Human Has Rights</i> offers kids an accessibly written list of these rights, commentary&#x2013;much of it deeply emotional&#x2013;by other kids, and richly evocative photography illustrating each right.

Gut Feelings delivers the science behind Malcolm Gladwell's <i>Blink.</i></b><br><br> Reflection and reason are overrated, according to renowned psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer. Much better qualified to help us make decisions is the cognitive, emotional, and social repertoire we call intuition, a suite of gut feelings that have evolved over the millennia specifically for making decisions. Gladwell drew heavily on Gigerenzer's research. But Gigerenzer goes a step further by explaining just why our gut instincts are so often right. Intuition, it seems, is not some sort of mystical chemical reaction but a neurologically based behavior that evolved to ensure that we humans respond quickly when faced with a dilemma (<i>BusinessWeek</i>).</p><p><b>Gerd Gigerenzer</b> is the author of <i>Gut Feelings</i>. He is currently the director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, Germany, and lectures around the world on the importance of proper risk education for everyone from school-age children to prominent doctors, bankers, and politicians.GUT FEELINGS is a fascinating analysis of how human beings make choices and judgments based on instincts. Author Gerd Gigerenzer explains where these gut feelings come from and talks about the role they play in our decisions about everything from business investments to choosing a mate. The text is peppered with plenty of anecdotes that keep it interesting and relevant. Dick Hill reads these examples with perfect inflection, and he reads the more scientific passages clearly and evenly, making complicated concepts easy to follow. This is a great narration because Hill remains unobtrusive, drawing the listenerï¿½s attention to the subject matter rather than his performance. With no apparent effort, he makes this book an entertaining and informative listen.

Much as I&#x2019;d like to be able to consult Charles Dickens regarding a plot twist or summon F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x2019;s advice about a turn of phrase, it&#x2019;s just me shining the light, digging with the pick. Some nights, many nights, the gold I mine is fool&#x2019;s gold that floats to the surface and is washed away the next morning; other nights, better nights, it glitters from the bedrock upon which the story is built.</p><p>In this manner of working I have never flattered myself as being much different from anyone else. The acknowledgment sections of a few novels to the contrary&#x2014;so many mentions that one would believe producing a book is a collaboration requiring the manpower of the Normandy Invasion&#x2014;writing remains a solitary, constantly humbling affair that comes down to one person aspiring to unearth fundamental human truths, or at least tell a compelling story, while stringing together lies summoned from the ether. There&#x2019;s a measure of irony in the fact that one shuts the door on his fellow man in order to write about him, but recognizing the predicament you have put yourself in doesn&#x2019;t seem to alleviate the difficulties.</p><p>Those who are truly important in a writer&#x2019;s development belong to a short list indeed, at the top of which is the person who bestows upon him or her the magic of the written word. In my case that is my mother, Beverly McCafferty, whose voice, as she read aloud to me a children&#x2019;s book about a little snake titled <i>Slim Green</i>, is among my very first memories. Then came the writers whose books first compelled me to turn the pages myself. They include Mark Twain, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and Jim Corbett. I was nine years old when our car broke down and I found myself with two hours to read in a Denver public library, where I chose a story called &#x201c;The Talla Des Man-eater&#x201d; in <i>The Temple Tiger and More Man-eaters of Kumaon</i>. I opened the book wanting to lead a life of adventure. I closed it wanting to write about it. Rounding out the most important influences are those people who provide the necessary support for the realization of the writer&#x2019;s dream, and so are not among the well-wishers from afar (nice as it is to have them), but loved ones who not only share the infrequent celebration, but far too often suffer the doubts and fear of failure that plague all writers. My wife, Gail Schontzler, who also is my first and most trusted editor, deserves all the credit for keeping body and soul together.</p><p>On the professional side of the ledger, I wish to recognize my literary agent, Dominick Abel, as well as the team at Viking/Penguin who help me polish, publish and promote the final effort. They include Kathryn Court, Tara Singh, Scott Cohen, Beena Kamlani, Mary-Margaret Callahan and Rebecca Lang. Independent bookstore owners remain crucial to bringing writers to the attention of the reading public. None has been more helpful to me than Barbara Peters at the Poisoned Pen in Scottsdale, Arizona, and Ariana Paliobagis at the Country Bookshelf in Bozeman, Montana. I&#x2019;d also like to thank Hurricane Isaac, which caused an electrical outage in New Orleans that led to Nevada Barr picking up my second novel, <i>The Gray Ghost Murders</i>, to while away a few powerless hours. For her irreverence and encouragement, both personally and professionally, I&#x2019;m grateful. <i>Dead Man&#x2019;s Fancy</i> demanded I have a thorough understanding of the wolf reintroduction effort in the Rockies and its ramifications for those who live among these great predators. Many thanks to all those I have interviewed over the past several years, on both sides of this controversial issue. In particular I&#x2019;d like to recognize Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks biologists Julie Cunningham, Justin Gude and Ken Hamlin, and wolf specialist Mike Ross. Special thanks to Robert Millage.</p><p>There are winter days in Montana when the office feels cold even with a wood fire and I need more warmth than Rhett, my adopted feral cat, can provide. On these mornings I bicycle through the snow on studded tires to Wild Joe&#x2019;s Coffee Shop, where baristas Marissa Grinestaff, Jenalyn Lorilla, Adam Golder, Corissa Hannemann and Melissa Hoard, along with writer pal Sarah Grigg, make me feel at home, and a little less lonely in a lonely line of work.</p><p>Finally, there are the remarkable individuals who inspire my best effort simply because I look up to them in life and don&#x2019;t dare let them down. These include my children, Jessie and Thomas McCafferty, my brother, Kevin McCafferty, and my life-long friend, Karen Basil. And my aunt Jackie Bailie&#x2014;matchmaker, dog boarder, and doctor of dubious mail-order degrees&#x2014;who mended spiritually broken children with a wave of her fairy godmother wand, or, when the body needed more succor than a seventy-year-old woman wearing a prom dress and face glitter could provide, passed herself off as a physician and cajoled specialists into seeing patients they otherwise would never have seen.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just whirring away in there, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Jackie once told a little boy whose thoughts were so jumbled he found it hard to talk. &#x201c;Some day you&#x2019;ll be a writer, and I will say I knew you when.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Where Trees Grow Close Together</p><p><b>A</b>t the sound, Martha Ettinger glanced from the trail, the brim of her hat rising to uncover the early stars. In the foredistance loomed the indigo silhouette of Papoose Mountain.

She told Walt while the horses blew from the climb.</p><p>He made a sound like <i>puh</i>. &#x201c;That story don&#x2019;t make no sense &#x2019;t all,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s called folklore.

Children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) require specialized instruction and behavior support to teach them critical skills and establish a meaningful quality of life. However, these objectives can only be achieved if professional and paraprofessional service providers have access to the most effective evidence-based and empirically supported methods for teaching children with autism. Similarly, practitioners must know about effective intervention methods that can be implemented to reduce and eliminate problem behaviors frequently displayed by people who have ASD. This guide is an indispensible asset, appropriate for any behavioral specialist, on all aspects of this increasingly prevalent disorder. Teaching and Behavior Support for Children and Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder brings together contributed chapters on assessment, instruction, and behavioral intervention procedures unique to the autism population. Each chapter covers a single topic according to a uniform format, which will ease comprehension and facilitate procedural adaptation in &#34;real world&#34; settings such as school, home, and the community. Usable advice and methods for teaching difficult skills, such as self-care, verbal language, and communication, are provided. Authored by recognized experts, the concise and readable chapters also feature forms, illustrations, summary tables, and resource lists to further guide practitioners in selecting &#34;best practice&#34; methods. Taking into account specific settings, different age groups, and practitioner experience, this book will serve as a resource for educators, psychologists, and behavior specialists in the field of autism education</p><p><br><strong>James K.

It is grounded in an extensive study of rare and primary sources and represents a landmark revisionist history of how the breeders of money gained dominion over the West. </p><p>For most of the first 1500 years of Christianity usury, the lending of money at interest, was unanimously condemned by the Fathers of the Early Church, and by popes, councils and saints, as a damnable sin equivalent to robbery and even murder. Any interest on loans of money, not just exorbitant interest, was defined <i>de fide</i> as a grave transgression against God and man.</p><p>Hoffman confronts the reader with a startling datum: the overthrow of magisterial dogma and the approval of scripture-twisting heresy occurred inside the Church centuries before the Enlightenment and the dawn of the modern era, culminating in the overthrow of divine truth; an epochal act of nullification.</p><p><i>Usury in Christendom: The Mortal Sin that Was and Now is Not</i> resurrects the suppressed biblical, patristic and medieval Catholic doctrine on interest on money, provides new information on the record of early Protestant resistance to the usury revolution, and the discernment, by Dante and other visionaries, of the sub-rosa connection between usury and a host of abominations that continue to plague us today.</p><p>Western civilization was profoundly disfigured by the ecclesiastic exculpation of the charging of interest on debt. The result has been a pursuit of usurious profit unconstrained by the Word of God, the dogma of His true Church, and the <i>consensus patrum</i> of fifteen centuries.</p></p><p>Michael Hoffman is an independent scholar and a former reporter for the New York bureau of the Associated Press. He is the author of eight books and the editor of the newsletter, <i>Revisionist History.</i>Michael Hoffman is undoubtedly one of the leading thinkers on the Money Power....Hoffman does not mince words, is a formidable academic...his latest book is called <i>Usury in Christendom</i> and is a virulent attack against Usury, the Money Power and Christians going along. He is forceful, scathing, to the point and incredibly well informed. --Anthony Migchels, <i>Usuryfree.blogspot.com</i></p><h2>Liam Charles Cheeky Treats: 70 Brilliant Bakes and Cakes</h2><p><br>When you bake you want the results to be mouth-watering and jaw-droppingly good.

Now, the man once called the Red Hood is looking for a fresh start.<br> &nbsp;<br> But dark forces are looking for <i>him</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> The nameless entities of evil called the Untitled are massing their power, ready to plunge the world into darkness.

These planets are in different signs and modes and are deeply significant, for they usually symbolize patterns in families that have lasted for generations. This is what Hamaker-Zondag discovered when she started to research the inconjunct aspect as it related to a yod. Also included in this book is a complete discussion of how the energies of unaspected planets, and planets in duet (that only aspect each other) are expressed in a person's birth chart. Hamaker-Zondag says that people with a yod are often insecure, or have trouble expressing themselves, and there is an emphasis on stalemates or unusual situations. She analyzes the background and places it in a broader perspective, including how she works with elements, modes, orbs, and other astrological factors when interpreting this aspect. All in all, this is one of the most exciting books on aspect interpretation published in recent years!</p><p>Included are great case histories: you have a chance to examine the Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp, Kenneth Starr, Bill Clinton scenario and see it with new eyes. And Princess Diana, Prince Charles, and Prince William are not without these family patterns. The stories are profound. These aspects work in the lives of people who change the world, people who have lived the unpopular position of stalemate, delay, and social change indicated by the presence of a yod in their natal chart, by transit, or by progression. She uses the examples of Gandhi, Vaclav Havel, Khomeini, Solzhenitsyn, Willy Brandt, C. G. Jung, Jim Jones, and others. To help you work with your own clients, Hamaker-Zondag brings in the charts of her personal clients and explains them in depth.</p><p>When you've read this book, you'll want to check out the charts of everyone you know!</p></p><p><p>Karen Hamaker-Zondag is the author of fifteen books, including The Twelfth House and Tarot as a Way of Life.

Yonas kneels in his mother&#x2019;s prayer room, pleading to his god for an end to the violence that has wracked his family and country. His father, Hailu, a prominent doctor, has been ordered to report to jail after helping a victim of state-sanctioned torture to die.

Dwelling upon de Kooning's use of preparatory sketches and recycled pictorial elements, the author deflates the rhetoric of action painting that has oversimplified the artist's work. Subsequent essays by Elderfield, Mahony, and Jennifer Field offer erudite studies of everything from the WPA works and the "Woman" series to de Kooning's "full arm" "urban landscapes" and the torqued ribbons of his late canvases. This is a catalogue about biography, sources (many of them from pre-modern painting), process, form, and-particularly in the studies of major works by conservationists Jim Coddington and Susan F. Lake-materials...the many reproductions are invaluable, and Delphine Huisinga's meticulous chronologies are a boon to researchers. (S. K. Rich <i>Choice</i>)<br><br>This volume magnifies and clarifies the great exhibition's many facets, honoring the complexity of de Kooning's historical presence and his work's lasting fascination. Short essays examine various aspects of nine distinct phases of his career; to each phase is appended a detailed chronology and an analysis of materials and methods used in a single representative canvas. In his idiosyncratic syntax, de Kooning once described himself as a "slipping glimpser," referring to his preference for the incomplete or provisional information that a dynamic viewpoint affords, and this teeming book aptly provides slipping glimpses of one of the giants of 20th-century painting. (Maine Stephen <i>Art in America</i>)<br><br>"De Kooning: A Retrospective" is a superlative exhibition. (Its catalogue is equally fantastic.) (Tyler Green <i>Modern Art Notes/ARTINFO</i>)<br><br>Bring open eyes and an open mind, for if you cherish the ox of any aesthetic of ideological bias, de Kooning will gore it. (Peter Schjeldahl <i>The New Yorker</i>)<br><br>The Museum of Modern Art's generous, even prodigal De Kooning retrospective is the most ambitious show New York has seen in a long time - a lavish, knotty and definitive tribute to a tricky and alloyed genius. (Ariella Budick <i>Financial Times</i>)<br><br>"...the first comprehensive look at de Kooning's work in nearly 30 years..." (Carol Vogel <i>The New York Times</i>)<br><br>"De Kooning: A Retrospective," at the Museum of Modern Art, is the most piercing, inexhaustible, and relentlessly intense full-on career survey I have ever seen in this country. (Jerry Saltz <i>New York Magazine</i>)<br><br>If you are looking for something jaw-dropping, then look no further than this sprawling retrospective devoted to one of the most important figures in 20th century American painting. (Carolina Miranda <i>WNYC Culture</i>)<br><br>Predictably awe-inspiring... In its scale, crï¿½me-de-la-crï¿½me editing and processional sweep, it's MoMA in excelsis, and for many people it will probably represent this institution's history-writing at its best. (Holland Cotter <i>The New York Times</i>)<br><br>The first retrospective since de Kooning's death in 1997, it will give us our first opportunity to experience the artist from start to almost-finish.

Loyal DT fans and new readers alike will appreciate this revised edition of <i>The Gunslinger</i>, which breathes new life into Roland of Gilead, and offers readers a "clearer start and slightly easier entry into Roland's world."<p> King writes both a new introduction and foreword to this revised edition, and the ever-patient, ever-loyal "constant reader" is rewarded with secrets to the series's inception. That a "magic" ream of green paper and a Robert Browning poem, came together to reveal to King his "ka" is no real surprise (this is King after all), but who would have thought that the squinty-eyed trio of Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach would set the author on his true path to the Tower? While King credits Tolkien for inspiring the "quest and magic" that pervades the series, it was Sergio Leone's <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</i> that helped create the epic proportions and "almost absurdly majestic western backdrop" of Roland's world.</p><p> To King, <i>The Gunslinger</i> demanded revision because once the series was complete it became obvious that "the beginning was out of sync with the ending." While the revision adds only 35 pages, Dark Tower purists will notice the changes to Allie's fate and Roland's interaction with Cort, Jake, and the Man in Black--all stellar scenes that will reignite the hunger for the rest of the series. Newcomers will appreciate the details and insight into Roland's life. The revised Roland of Gilead (nee Deschain) is embodied with more humanity--he loves, he pities, he regrets. What DT fans might miss is the same ambiguity and mystery of the original that gave the original its pulpy underground feel (back when King himself awaited word from Roland's world). <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p>Stephen King is the bestselling author of more than fifty books.

Morrison thanked Fowlie for producing an English translation of the complete poems of Rimbaud. He needed the translation, he said, because, "I don&#x2019;t read French that easily. . . . I am a rock singer and your book travels around with me." Fourteen years later, when Fowlie first heard the music of the Doors, he recognized the influence of Rimbaud in Morrison&#x2019;s lyrics.<br><br> In <i>Rimbaud and Jim Morrison</i> Fowlie, a master of the form of the memoir, reconstructs the lives of the two youthful poets from a personal perspective. In their twinned stories he discovers an uncanny symmetry, a pattern far richer than the simple truth that both led lives full of adventure and both made poetry of their thirst for the liberation of the self. The result is an engaging account of the connections between an exceptional French symbolist who gave up writing poetry at the age of twenty, died young, and whose poems are still avidly read to this day, and an American rock musician whose brief career ignited an entire generation and has continued to fascinate millions around the world in the twenty years since his death in Paris. In this dual portrait, Fowlie gives us a glimpse of the affinities and resemblances between European literary traditions and American rock music and youth culture in the late twentieth century.<br><br> A personal meditation on two unusual, yet emblematic, cultural figures, this book also stands as a summary of a noted scholar&#x2019;s lifelong reflections on creative artists.</p></p><p>&#34;I have little doubt Jim Morrison would be both flattered by and proud of Wallace Fowlie&#39;s analytic literary analysis of his poetry and lyrics. It was a 19-year-old Jim Morrison who wrote Mr. Fowlie to thank him for translating his hero Arthur Rimbaud into English from French and it would be a grateful Jim Morrison who would thank Wallace Fowlie today for tracing and linking his work with such a distinguished poetic heritage.&#34;--Danny Sugerman, author of &#34;Wonderland Avenue&#34; and co-author of &#34;No One Here Gets Out Alive.&#34;<p>At the time of his death, Wallace Fowlie was James B. Duke Professor Emeritus of French Literature at Duke University. He is the author and translator of thirty books, including <i>Rimbaud: A Critical Study </i>and <i>The Complete Works of Rimbaud</i>, a translation. This is the fifth volume in a series of memoirs, <i>Memory</i>, <i>Sites</i>, <i>Aubade</i>, and <i>Journal of Rehearsals,</i> all published by Duke University Press.</p></p><h2>The Darkest Kiss</h2><p>Danger turns her on.<br>Desire turns her dangerous...<br><br>Riley Jenson hunts evildoers&#x2014;and does it with a style all her own.

Not easily, anyway. I was dhampire&#x2014;the offspring of a newly turned vampire whose dying seed somehow created life in the werewolf who raped and then killed him&#x2014;and my bones were extraordinarily strong.<br><br>Being pushed from a tree couldn't kill me like it did those countless nestlings. But God, it could still <i>hurt</i>.<br><br>I mean, werewolves weren't designed to fly, and muscles used to being either a wolf or a woman were having trouble with the mechanics of being a bird.<br><br>Not that I particularly <i>wanted</i>&nbsp;to be a bird. And particularly not the type of bird I could now become. I mean, a seagull? A rat of the sea? Why that? Why not something more dignified and fearsome&#x2014;like a hawk or an eagle? Something with useful weapons like talons and a hooked beak built for tearing?<br><br>But no. Fate had thrown me a seagull. I'm sure she was up there laughing at me right now.<br><br>Of course, I probably <i>could</i> become something else. The drug in my system that had caused the initial change into a gull would probably allow me to take other forms, but I wasn't about to risk it. The other half-breeds who'd been injected with ARC1-23 had changed into so many different forms that they'd lost the ability to become human again, and that wasn't a problem I was willing to face. Especially not when I'd already felt that moment of confusion, right after I'd first attained gull shape, when the magic that allowed me to shift shape had seemed to hesitate, as if it couldn't remember my human form.<br><br>That had terrified me.<br><br>So, much as I hated being a gull, I was going to stick with it, practice its form, until being a gull was as natural and as ingrained into my psyche as the wolf and the woman.<br><br>Maybe then I would play with other shapes.<br><br>Maybe.<br><br>"Riley, you cannot stay on the ground forever," a deep voice rumbled from above. "Learning to fly is a matter of perseverance. And height."<br><br>I muttered something unpleasant under my breath and rolled onto my back. A dozen different aches assaulted the muscles along my shoulders, spine, and arms, and made me long for the heat of a nice, deep bath. Though even a bath wouldn't do much for all the bruises I was beginning to collect.<br><br>Not that a bath was in my immediate future anyway, if old Henry had his way.<br><br>He was sitting in one of the top forks of the gum tree high above me, his bright red shirt contrasting sharply against the cheery yellow flowers that dotted the tree. His silver hair gleamed like ice in the dappled sunlight, and his nut-brown skin was as weathered and worn as the bark of the tree itself.<br><br>He wasn't Directorate personnel, but rather a friend of Jack's. He was also a hawk-shifter, and his family apparently had ties with Jack's that went way back. I'd tried some gentle questioning in an effort to glean something useful about my boss, but Henry had so far proved an unwilling gossiper.<br><br>"Riley," he warned again.<br><br>"Henry," I said, mimicking his cross tone. "I'm not going to have an inch of white skin left if you keep this up."<br><br>"Jack says you must learn as quickly as possible."<br><br>"Jack hasn't been thrown out of a tree a million times."<br><br>He laughed&#x2014;a rich, merry sound that had a smile tugging at my lips despite my grumpiness.<br><br>"It's only twenty today. It took Jack a good thirty or so times a day&#x2014;for a week&#x2014;before he got it."<br><br>Jack might be a vampire now&#x2014;thanks to the blood ceremony he'd taken over eight hundred years ago&#x2014;but he'd been born a hawk-shifter and had the advantage of coming from a family of shifters. If it had taken <i>him</i> so long to learn, then heaven help me.<br><br>I raised my eyebrows and pushed up into a sitting position. "You taught Jack?"<br><br>&nbsp;"I am not that old, little wolf. No, it's just something of a legend in our roost. Few hawks are so slow to learn." He laughed again. "There are some who say that's why he's bald. He lost his hair because he landed on his head too often."<br><br>I grinned. "Well, I'm glad to know it's not just us seagulls."<br><br>"You have spent most of your life as a wolf. It's natural that you would find the ways of flying difficult." He shook the rope tied to the branch near his legs. "Come."<br><br>"If it was as easy as coming, I'd be a natural." I rose, and bit back a groan as a dozen fresh aches erupted across my torso and legs. Damn, I was going to be black and blue by tonight. Not that it really mattered. It wasn't like I had anyone to go home to anymore.<br><br>Pain rose like an old ghost. I quickly shoved any thoughts of Kellen back into the box labeled "do not think about," then reached for the rope and began to climb. It had been two months since we'd split. I should be getting over it by now. Should be getting over him.<br><br>But I wasn't, and I wasn't actually sure I ever would. I'd loved him, and he'd walked away. And not for the reason I'd most expected&#x2014;the fact that I was infertile, and a half-breed. No, he'd walked away because I was a guardian and wouldn't give it up. And the fact that I <i>couldn't</i>, thanks to the drug and the havoc it was still wreaking on my system, hadn't made a difference.<br><br>He'd walked away. Become just another man who couldn't accept what I was. Another man who'd managed to smash my heart.<br><br>I'd had just about enough of the whole damn "love and relationships" thing. So much so that, since our split, I'd been keeping pretty much to myself. Of course, I was a werewolf, so the moon heat would always ensure sex was a part of my life. But that one week was about it for me and men. It seemed that love and I were never going to find a happy medium, and as much as I still wanted the whole picket fence ideal, I just wasn't up to coping with the whims and foibles of men right now.<br><br>Chocolate, coffee, and ice cream were far more reliable when it came to providing a good time, and at least <i>they</i> would never disappoint me.<br><br>I just had to thank the fast metabolism of a wolf for the fact that I hadn't put on any weight over the last few months. If I were human, I'd be the size of a house.<br><br>I reached Henry's branch and edged carefully past, sitting down and letting my feet dangle. My fingers were clamped around the branch tightly and I avoided looking down. Since my last fall off a cliff&#x2014;the same one in which I'd gained my gull shape&#x2014;my stomach had been getting a mite queasy at even the slightest hint of a drop. Though I suppose that jumping repeatedly out of this tree and landing face-first on the ground below&#x2014;and not breaking any bones&#x2014;was going a long way toward curing a little of my unease.<br><br>I took a deep breath and blew it out softly. "So, explain it all to me one more time."<br><br>"A bird does not fly by simply flapping its wings," he said patiently. "Hold your arms out now, and try moving them really fast."<br><br>I did, feeling like a fool. Luckily, we were on Henry's estate up in the Dandenong hills, and well out of the way of curious passersby.<br><br>"Now, try turning your arms as you move them. More air motion happens as you twist your arms, does it not?"<br><br>I nodded, though to be honest, the difference was negligible. But then, maybe I'd hit the ground one too many times and my skin just wasn't up to feeling anything anymore.<br><br>"This is how it works with a bird. On the downstroke of the wing, the leading edge must be lower than the rear edge. And it doesn't just move down, it moves down and back, providing lift and forward movement."<br><br>"Yep, got that totally." Not.<br><br>He clipped me lightly over the ear. "Enough of the smart mouth, young woman. You can do this. You just need to think."<br><br>"All the thinking cells are either too bruised or knocked senseless," I muttered, edging a little farther along the branch so he couldn't hit me harder.<br><br>Anyone would have thought I was a teenager back at school again. I used to get clips over the ear for my smart mouth then, too.<br><br>"Think," he said. "Down, back, then up. Not up and down. Now change."<br><br>I blew out a breath, then shifted position and called to the magic that lay in my soul&#x2014;the magic that had been altered to supply the form of the gull as well as the wolf. Power swept through me, around me, changing my body, changing my form, sweeping me from human to gull in the blink of an eye.<br><br>"Go," Henry said.<br><br>I spread my wings, closed my eyes, and jumped. Felt myself falling, felt the old familiar sense of panic roll through me, threatening to overwhelm. To freeze.<br><br>So I tried to concentrate on moving my wings instead. <i>Down, back, up, down, back, up.</i><br><br>And miraculously, I was no longer falling. I squeezed open an eye, saw the ground sweeping past underneath me, and opened the other eye. I was <i>flying</i>.<br><br>"That's it," Henry said. "You've got it, my girl!"<br><br>"Woohoo!" The sound came out as a harsh-sounding squawk rather than any actual word, but for once I didn't care. I was <i>flying</i>. And it was such an amazing, powerful feeling.<br><br>Unfortunately, it didn't last long enough. Maybe I was so wrapped up in the sensation of flying that I actually forgot to fly, because suddenly the ground was approaching at the rate of knots and I was tumbling through the grass and twigs and dirt again.<br><br>I shifted to human shape and spat out a mouthful of earth. "Well, crap."<br><br>Henry laughed. He was lucky that I wasn't up there with him, because I would have damn well pushed him off the branch.<br><br>"It's not funny, Henry."<br><br>"No, it's hysterical. Most fledglings at least learn to land with some dignity by this time. I fear you and Jack are two peas in a pod."<br><br>I rolled onto my back and stared up at the blue sky that seemed as impossible to reach as ever. "If all this makes me go bald like him, I will not be happy."<br><br>"You flew, Riley," he said, amusement still evident in his voice. "It might not have been for long, but you flew. Soon you'll get a grip on the mechanics of it all."<br><br>"Even with my coordination? Or lack thereof?"<br><br>"Even with."<br><br>I grunted and hoped like hell he was right. When I glanced at my watch, I saw it was nearly three. I'd been at this whole falling thing for nearly six hours, and I'd just about had enough.<br><br>Of course, a crash course in flying was the least of my problems. Jack wasn't happy that I'd waited so long before telling him about the change, and lately he'd been taking every opportunity to chew me out. According to him, a broken heart was no reason for stupidity. I was beginning to think he'd never been in love. Or that it had happened so long ago that he'd forgotten the pain of it.<br><br>"I think I'll call it quits for the day, Henry. My bones are feeling a little battered."<br><br>"Go on up and help yourself to a shower, then. I think I'll go for a fly myself, stretch some of the kinks out of my wings."<br><br>"I'll see you tomorrow?"<br><br>"You will, my girl, you will."<br><br>He shifted shape and stepped off the branch, swooping low past my head before soaring up into the blue. I watched his brown and gold form until it disappeared, and couldn't help the touch of jealousy. I wanted to fly like that, I really did, but I was beginning to doubt it would ever happen.<br><br>With a sigh, I dragged my battered body to its feet and walked over to the tree to retrieve my clothes. The magic that allowed us to shift shape didn't always take the best care of the clothes we were wearing, so I tended to shed my outer layer for these lessons and just wear strong cotton undies and a T-shirt. Of course, that meant more scrapes and bruises than I would have gotten if I'd worn jeans and thicker tops. But, like most weres and shifters, I healed extraordinarily fast. Jeans and tops weren't as easy to fix or replace. Not when I had a brother who kept blowing the family budget.<br><br>I grabbed the bundle of clothes and headed back to Henry's tree house. Not that it was actually a tree house&#x2014;just an old wooden house built on stilts, so that the living areas were high in the canopy of the surrounding trees. The light that filtered in through the windows had a pale, green-gold look, and the air was always rich with the smell of eucalyptus and the songs of birds. I loved it, despite my fear of heights. It had to be heaven for a bird-shifter.<br><br>I rattled up the stairs and made my way to the bathroom, taking a quick hot shower before getting dressed. Brushing my hair took a little longer than usual. It had grown amazingly fast in the last few months, and now streamed in thick red layers to well past my shoulders. The only trouble was it tended to get horribly knotted, especially when falling out of trees onto leaf-littered ground.<br><br>Once it was tangle-free, I swept it into a ponytail to keep it that way, then collected my purse and car keys and headed out. But I'd barely made it back to my car when my cell phone rang.<br><br>I knew, without a doubt, that it would be Jack. And it wasn't my strengthening skill of clairvoyance that told me that.<br><br>It was experience.<br><br>Jack always tended to ring when I least wanted or needed to work.<br><br>I dug through the mess of my purse until I found my vid-phone. "You gave me a week to learn to fly," I said, by way of greeting. "It's only been three days."<br><br>"Yeah, well, tell it to the bad guys." Jack's voice was etched with a tiredness that matched the dark bags under his eyes. "The bastards seem to be going out of their way to be pains in the asses lately. Just like some guardians I know."</p><h2>Little Crow: Spokesman for the Sioux</h2><p>Government officials and missionaries wanted all Sioux men to become self-sufficient farmers, wear pants, and cut their hair. The Indians, confronted by a land-hungry white population and a loss of hunting grounds, sought to exchange title to their homeland for annuities of cash and food, schools and teachers, and farms and agricultural knowledge. By 1862 the Sioux realized that their extensive kinship network and religion were in jeopardy and that the government would not fulfill its promises.<br><br>With their way of life endangered, the Sioux turned to Little Crow to lead them in a war for self-preservation, a war that Little Crow had tried to avoid during most of his adult life. Within a year, the Sioux had been evicted from Minnesota, Little Crow was dead, and a way of life had vanished. Through his life-his biography-the complex interrelationship of Indian and white can be studied and, in some measure, understood.</p><p>"Little Crow makes a major contribution to our understanding of an Indian tribe that profoundly influenced the course of history in the upper Mississippi Valley, partly at least through the personal role played by its most famous leader." -- <i>New Mexico Historical Review</i></p><h2>Dark Debt (Chicagoland Vampires)</h2><p><b>"[A] WONDERFULLY COMPELLING RELUCTANT VAMPIRE HEROINE."-- <i>USA Today </i>Bestselling Author Julie Kenner</b> <br> <br> A vampire never gets old.

If it wasn&#x2019;t snowing, orange cones narrowed the Dan Ryan, or lower Wacker was closed. Snow and traffic defined our lives as Chicagoans.</p><p>Nested within those seasons were the other activities that defined life for many in Chicago. During baseball season, it was Cubs versus Sox. During tourist season, you served them, you screamed at them, or, if you worked at Billy Goat&#x2019;s, both. During summer, the beaches were open. And for a few spare weeks, the water of Lake Michigan was even warm enough for a dip.</p><p>Not that I&#x2019;d had much occasion to sunbathe or swim recently. They didn&#x2019;t make sunscreen strong enough for vampires.</p><p>But when spring rolled around and construction cones popped onto asphalt like neon flowers, even vampires shook off winter. We exchanged quilted jackets, electric blankets, heavy boots, and balaclavas for tanks, sandals, and nights in the warm spring air.</p><p>Tonight, we sat on a blanket on the grass at Milton Lee Olive Park, an expanse of green and fountains near Navy Pier honoring a soldier who&#x2019;d given his life to save others, and won a Medal of Honor for his sacrifice. A burst of spring air had warmed the city, and we&#x2019;d taken advantage, finding a quiet spot for a picnic to celebrate the end of a long, cold winter. At two o&#x2019;clock in the morning, the park was definitely quiet.</p><p>Ethan Sullivan, Master of Cadogan House and now one of twelve members of the newly established Assembly of American Masters, sat beside me on a piecework quilt, one knee bent, one leg extended, his hand at the small of my back, rubbing small circles as we watched the lights of Chicago blink across the skyline in front of us.</p><p>He had a tall and rangy body of hard planes and sculpted muscle, and golden blond hair that just reached his shoulders and surrounded honed cheekbones, a straight nose, deep-set green eyes, and imperious eyebrows. I was his Novitiate and the Cadogan&#x2019;s Sentinel, and I was utterly relieved that winter had finally weakened its grip on the city.</p><p>&#x201c;This is not a bad way to spend an evening,&#x201d; said the girl on the blanket beside ours, her striking blue hair drawn in a complicated braid that lay across her shoulder. Her Cupid&#x2019;s bow mouth was drawn into a smile, her hand clasped in the long fingers of her boyfriend&#x2019;s. He was well built and shaved-headed, with piercing green eyes and a generous mouth. And, like her, he was a sorcerer. He had a thing for snarky T-shirts, and tonight&#x2019;s gem was black, with KEEP CALM AND FIREBALL in clean white text across the front.</p><p>Mallory Carmichael was my oldest friend, and Catcher Bell was her live-in beau. Catcher worked for my grandfather Chuck Merit, the city&#x2019;s Supernatural Ombudsman.</p><p>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s not,&#x201d; I agreed. &#x201c;This was a very good idea.&#x201d; I sipped from a bottle of Sweet Summer Blood4You, a blend of blood and lemonade that I enjoyed against my own better judgment. The drink was good, and the air was sweet with spring and the scent of white flowers that drifted down from the trees like snow, forming constellations on the new grass. Ethan&#x2019;s hand warmed the skin on my back. This was as close to a day at the beach as I was ever likely to get. And it was a pretty good substitute.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought some fresh air could do us good,&#x201d; Mallory said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a long winter.&#x201d;</p><p>That was the understatement of all understatements. There&#x2019;d been murder, magic, mayhem, and too much mourning to go around, including episodes that had put Mallory in the hands of a serial killer and nearly cost Ethan his life. He was fine and she was recovering, and the incident had seemed to bring her and Catcher even closer together.</p><p>Even the vacation Ethan and I had just taken&#x2014;a trip to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado that should have been filled with relaxation, elk watching, and plenty of sex&#x2014;had been interrupted by a century-old feud between vampires and shape-shifters.</p><p>We&#x2019;d needed a break from our break, so we&#x2019;d sipped and snacked with Mallory and Catcher on the goodies Margot, the House chef, had packed. Grapes, cheese (both regular and almost preternaturally stinky), thin crackers, and small cookies coated in lemony powdered sugar with just the right balance of sweet and pucker. </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been eyeing that last lemon cookie for seven minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>I glanced back at Ethan, gave him a dour look. &#x201c;I have not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Seven minutes and forty-three seconds,&#x201d; Catcher said, glancing at his watch. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d grab it for you, but I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;d lose a finger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop torturing her,&#x201d; Mallory said, carefully picking up the cookie, handing it gingerly to me, then dusting powdered sugar from her hands. &#x201c;She can&#x2019;t help her obsession.&#x201d;</p><p>I started to argue, but by then my mouth was full of cookie. &#x201c;Not an obsession,&#x201d; I said when I was done. &#x201c;Fast metabolism and rigorous training schedule. Luc has us on two-a-days now that Ethan&#x2019;s been upgraded.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ooh, Ethan two-point-oh,&#x201d; Mallory said.</p><p>&#x201c;I think technically we&#x2019;re now at Ethan four-point-oh,&#x201d; Catcher pointed out. &#x201c;Human, vampire, resurrected vampire, AAM member.&#x201d;</p><p>Ethan snorted, but even he didn&#x2019;t argue with the timeline. &#x201c;I prefer to think of it as a promotion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You get a raise out of it?&#x201d; Catcher asked.</p><p>&#x201c;In a manner of speaking. I&#x2019;ll nearly be able to afford to keep Merit in the culinary style to which she&#x2019;d like to become accustomed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one with the expensive taste.&#x201d; I gestured to the bottle of wine. &#x201c;Do I even want to know how much that cost?&#x201d;</p><p>Ethan opened his mouth, closed it again. &#x201c;Likely not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And there you go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A vampire cannot survive on Italian hot beefs and Mallocakes alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Speak for yourself, fancy pants.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not fancy,&#x201d; Ethan said imperiously. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m particular. Which is actually a compliment to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He did pick you after four hundred years of wild-oat sowing,&#x201d; Catcher said, earning an elbow from Mallory. He grunted, but he was smiling when he lay back on the blanket, hands crossed behind his head.</p><p>&#x201c;You make it sound like Ethan picked her up at a farmers&#x2019; market,&#x201d; Mallory complained.</p><p>&#x201c;That would require Merit to eat vegetables,&#x201d; Ethan said, grinning at me. &#x201c;Could you differentiate between a rutabaga and rhubarb?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but only because my grandmother made the best strawberry-rhubarb pie I&#x2019;ve ever tasted.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that counts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, it counts,&#x201d; I said with a nod. &#x201c;That pie was sublime. I&#x2019;ve got solid culinary chops.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My culinarily chopped vampire missed a spot of powdered sugar,&#x201d; Ethan said, leaning forward, swiping his thumb across my lips just slowly enough to heat my blood.</p><p>&#x201c;Get a room,&#x201d; Catcher groused. He was grouchy but loyal, and had followed Mallory through her stint as a Maleficent wannabe and on to the other side. He was also unfailingly dedicated to my much-beloved grandfather, which gave him points in my book.</p><p>But I still gave him the much-deserved stink eye. &#x201c;Do you know how many times I&#x2019;ve seen you naked? You and Mallory considered the entire house your personal love shack.&#x201d; Mallory and I had been roommates once upon a time, before Catcher had moved into the town house we&#x2019;d shared, and I&#x2019;d moved into Cadogan House to escape the nudity.</p><p>&#x201c;Your&#x201d;&#x2014;I waved my hand at his body&#x2014;&#x201c;rod and tackle touched pretty much everything in the place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My body is a wonderland&#x201d; was his only response.</p><p>&#x201c;Be that as it may,&#x201d; Ethan said, &#x201c;Merit is not your Alice. I&#x2019;ll thank you to keep your rod and tackle away from her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nowhere near my agenda,&#x201d; Catcher assured him.</p><p>Ethan&#x2019;s phone beeped, and he pulled it out quickly, checked the screen.</p><p>&#x201c;Just a media inquiry,&#x201d; he said, tucking it away again.</p><p>Every phone call put us on high alert, because a ghost&#x2014;or someone pretending to be one&#x2014;had staked a claim on our lives. That ghost was Balthasar, the vampire who, on a battlefield nearly four hundred years ago, had made Ethan immortal and nearly turned him into a monster in his own image. Ethan had escaped his maker, made a new life for himself, and believed Balthasar had died shortly after he had escaped. Ethan hadn&#x2019;t yet told me the details, but he hadn&#x2019;t indicated any doubts about Balthasar&#x2019;s death.</p><p>And yet, three weeks ago, a note had been left in our top-floor apartments in Cadogan House. A note purporting to be from Balthasar, who was alive and excited to see Ethan again.</p><p>A note&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then nothing.</p><p>He&#x2019;d made no contact since then, and we&#x2019;d found no evidence he was alive, much less in Chicago and waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc, to wage war, to exert control over Ethan once again.</p><p>So we waited. Every phone call could be <i>the</i> call, the one that would change the life we&#x2019;d begun to make together. And there were so many more calls these days. The AAM was still working out the operational details, but that hadn&#x2019;t kept vampires from lining up outside Cadogan House like vassals, seeking protection, requesting Ethan&#x2019;s intervention in some city dispute, or offering fealty.</p><p>And vampires weren&#x2019;t the only ones interested. Chicago was home to twenty-five percent of the country&#x2019;s AAM members, and humans&#x2019; fascination with Ethan, Scott Grey, and Morgan Greer, who headed Grey House and Navarre House, had ballooned again.</p><p>It was a strange new world.</p><p>&#x201c;So, not to interrupt the mirth making,&#x201d; Mallory said, &#x201c;but there&#x2019;s actually a reason we asked you guys to come out tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who says &#x2018;mirth making&#x2019;?&#x201d; Catcher asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I do, Sarcastasaurus.&#x201d; She elbowed him, with a grin. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;re here for a reason?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, okay,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m going to need that on a T-shirt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was just thinking that,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re making me nervous. What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;</p><p>Catcher nodded. &#x201c;Well, as it turns out&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>As it turned out, Catcher was interrupted by an explosion of noise, our phones beeping wildly in obvious warning.</p><p>I got to mine first, saw Luc&#x2019;s number, switched it to speaker. &#x201c;Merit.&#x201d;</p><p>Luc&#x2019;s nose loomed on the screen. &#x201c;Sorry to interrupt date night.&#x201d;</p><p>I grimaced at the image. &#x201c;Step back from the camera. We don&#x2019;t need to see your sinuses.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said, leaning back so his nose moved back into proper perspective, right in the middle of his very charming face, which was surrounded by tousled blond-brown curls. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re alone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re with Catcher and Mallory,&#x201d; I said, then glanced around to ensure that no curious humans were eavesdropping. &#x201c;We can talk. What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Media vans at the House. Four of them. Mess of reporters, all gathered at the gate, ready and waiting.&#x201d; Luc&#x2019;s pause, matched with his drawn expression, made me nervous. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re asking questions about Balthasar.&#x201d;</p><p>We went quiet enough to hear the strains of a lone saxophone being played near the pier, probably a song being sold for tourists&#x2019; cash.</p><p>&#x201c;What questions?&#x201d; Ethan asked.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re asking about a supposed reunion,&#x201d; Luc said. The answer made T. S. Eliot echo alarmingly in my head.<i> This is the way the world ends.</i></p><p>Ethan&#x2019;s reaction was as hot and fast as Luc&#x2019;s had been cautious.</p><p>&#x201c;Double the guards on the gate,&#x201d; Ethan said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re on our way.&#x201d;</p><p>I wanted to argue with him, to tell him he&#x2019;d be safer staying put than running toward whatever reunion this Balthasar had planned. But Ethan was a stubborn and careful man. He wouldn&#x2019;t leave the House to face danger without him, and certainly not when the danger was a monster from Ethan&#x2019;s own past. Ethan still hadn&#x2019;t forgotten the things he&#x2019;d done when he was with Balthasar, or forgiven himself for his own complicity. He was still looking for redemption. And he&#x2019;d meet that opportunity head-on.</p><p>We said our good-byes, and I tucked the phone into my pocket again, tried to mentally prepare myself for what we might face&#x2014;what Ethan might have to face, and the emotional storm that might rip through both of us.</p><p>And then I looked at Mallory and Catcher, remembering they&#x2019;d been on the verge of making their own announcement.</p><p>&#x201c;Go,&#x201d; Catcher said, even as Mallory began stuffing food back into the picnic basket. She was playing the trouper, but I could see the frustration in her eyes. &#x201c;You want us with you?&#x201d;</p><p>Ethan shook his head. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no point in dragging you into this debacle. Balthasar is dead; this is someone else&#x2019;s ploy for attention.&#x201d;</p><p>Catcher nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell Chuck, put him on alert just in case.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Be careful,&#x201d; Mallory said, and squeezed me into a hug.</p><p>&#x201c;I will,&#x201d; I said, searching her gaze for answers, and finding none. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. We can talk about this later. Take care of your House first. <i>Go</i>,&#x201d; she said when I hadn&#x2019;t moved, and turned me toward the street.</p><p>We went, jogging back toward Grand and the tall man with blond hair who waited for us in front of a glossy black Range Rover with a license plate that read CADOGAN. He wore a trim black suit and a sleek black tie, hands clasped in front of him.</p><p>&#x201c;Sire,&#x201d; he said, bowing his head. Brody was a Cadogan House guard who&#x2019;d been appointed Ethan&#x2019;s official driver. Luc had outfitted Ethan with all the necessary perks, including the car, which was equipped with a complete security system, a small arsenal, and a comm center.</p><p>&#x201c;Luc called,&#x201d; Brody said, pivoting smoothly to open the door, one hand on his tie as he waited for Ethan and me to climb into the backseat. He closed the door with a solid thud, then rounded the car and slid inside onto the driver&#x2019;s seat.</p><p>The car was comfortable, and I appreciated that Ethan had extra security, but I missed Moneypenny, my vintage Mercedes convertible. She was currently parked in the basement of Cadogan House, weeping from neglect. I missed the freedom, the quiet, the solitude of a good long drive&#x2014;as most drives anywhere in Chicago tended to be.</p><p>Unless Brody was driving.</p><p>&#x201c;May I?&#x201d; he asked, meeting Ethan&#x2019;s gaze in the rearview mirror, not doing a very good job of fighting back a smile. Brody had been a new guard, and he was still pink around the edges. But he did have one particularly enviable skill.</p><p>The boy could handle a car.</p><p>He was Chicago&#x2019;s version of the Transporter&#x2014;master of the smooth ride, but equally adept at weaving and dodging through Chicago&#x2019;s gnarly traffic. Luc had given Brody a dressing-down the first time he&#x2019;d ridden with him. But when the time came to assign Ethan a driver, he turned to Brody first.</p><p>&#x201c;If you can get us there in one piece,&#x201d; Ethan said, and managed not to flinch when Brody dashed into traffic like a cheetah in pursuit.</p><p>Brody just avoided nicking a cab, then slipped smoothly into a gap in the other lane.</p><p><i>I&#x2019;m not sure when I&#x2019;m going to get used to this,</i> Ethan said silently, using the telepathic connection between us.</p><p><i>You&#x2019;re just irritated you aren&#x2019;t the one driving.</i></p><p><i>I have a Ferrari for just such occasions. And speaking of occasions, what was Mallory&#x2019;s and Catcher&#x2019;s production about?</i> <i>She&#x2019;d looked upset.</i></p><p><i>I&#x2019;m not sure,</i> I admitted. <i>But if it was really bad news, I don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;d have arranged a picnic. </i>There were plenty of milestones that might merit a picni...</p></p><h2>The Babar Collection: Four Classic Stories</h2><p>Jean de Brunhoff&#x2019;s tales of Babar have charmed readers around the world for 80 years.

D. 121, and assumed the name of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, by which he is known to history, on his adoption by the Emperor T. Aurelius Antoninus. M. Aurelius was educated by the orator Fronto, but turned aside from rhetoric to the study of the Stoic philosophy, of which he was the last distinguished representative. The &#34;Meditations,&#34; which he wrote in Greek, are among the most noteworthy expressions of this system, and exhibit it favorably on its practical side. The &#34;Meditations&#34; picture with faithfulness the mind and character of this noblest of the Emperors. Simple in style and sincere in tone, they record for all time the height reached by pagan aspiration in its effort to solve the problem of conduct; and the essential agreement of his practice with his teaching proved that &#34;Even in a palace life may be led well.&#34;</p><p>One measure, perhaps, of a book's worth, is its intergenerational pliancy: do new readers acquire it and interpret it afresh down through the ages? The <i>Meditations</i> of Marcus Aurelius, translated and introduced by Gregory Hays, by that standard, is very worthwhile, indeed. Hays suggests that its most recent incarnation--as a self-help book--is not only valid, but may be close to the author's intent. The book, which Hays calls, fondly, a "haphazard set of notes," is indicative of the role of philosophy among the ancients in that it is "expected to provide a 'design for living.'" And it does, both aphoristically ("Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly.") and rhetorically ("What is it in ourselves that we should prize?"). Whether these, and other entries ("Enough of this wretched, whining monkey life.") sound life-changing or like entries in a teenager's diary is up to the individual reader, as it should be. Hays's introduction, which sketches the life of Marcus Aurelius (emperor of Rome A.D. 161-180) as well as the basic tenets of stoicism, is accessible and jaunty. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i>The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus embodied in his person that deeply cherished, ideal figure of antiquity, the philosopher-king. His Meditations, written in moments snatched from military campaigns and the rigors of politics, reveal a mind of exceptional clarity and originality, and a spirit attuned to both the particulars of human destiny and the vast patterns which underlie it.</p><h2>The Crystal Variation (2) (Liaden Universeï¿½)</h2><p>#2 in our &#x201c;Omni&#x201d; three-volume compilations of Liaden Universeï¿½ novels.&nbsp; These are the &#x201c;origin&#x201d; novels in the&nbsp; breakthrough, hugely-popular Liaden Universeï¿½ space opera series!&nbsp; Across a fallen galaxy, the Liaden have risen to take on the challenge of bringing trade and civilization to the stars and, in the process, made themselves the aristocrats of known space.&nbsp; Adventure, intrigue, romance &#x2013; on an interplanetary scale!<br><br>The three Liaden Universeï¿½ universe &#x201c;origin&#x201d; novels collected together for the very first time in one omni edition!&nbsp; Across a fallen galaxy, the Liaden have risen to take on the challenge of bringing trade and civilization to the stars and, in the process, made themselves the aristocrats of known space.&nbsp; Bred to scout, to pilot and to trade, Clan Korval is ascendant among other families arrayed within the incredibly intricate and formal Liad social structure.&nbsp; But along the way Korval makes powerful enemies.&nbsp; Lee and Miller quite simply set the modern standard for full-on, audacious space opera.&nbsp; <br><br><i>Crystal Soldier</i><br>The galaxy is in danger.&nbsp; A mysterious alien race of energy being called the <i>shereika</i> is rapidly unmaking &#x2013; dissipating, lock, stock and quark -- entire star systems.&nbsp; Humans are making their last stand.&nbsp; M.

He had a registration number&#x2014;657-2929-04, Human/Terra&#x2014;and he had a class, salvage tug, but he didn&#x2019;t have a name.<br> <br>Officially.<br> <br>We called him Singer. If Singer had an opinion on the issue, he&#x2019;d never registered it&#x2014;but he never complained. Singer was the shipmind as well as the ship&#x2014;or at least, he inhabited the ship&#x2019;s virtual spaces the same way we inhabited the physical ones&#x2014;but my partner Connla and I didn&#x2019;t own him. You can&#x2019;t own a sentience in civilized space.<br> <br>Singer was a sliver of a thing suspended electromagnetically at the center of a quicksilver loop as thin in cross section as an old-fashioned wedding band, but a hundred and fifty meters across the diameter and ten meters from edge to edge. In any meaningful gravity, the ring would have crumpled and sagged like a curl of wax arched over the candleflame. But here in space, reinforced with electromagnetic supports, it spanned the horizon of the viewport in a clean arc.<br> <br>I held on to a rail with one afthand, lazily comfortable as I watched the light sliding in Doppler-watered bands across the silver surface of the white coils. The concentrated colors of the ring moved across a background that looked like a dilute version of the same pattern, as the action of the white drive changed what would have been a gorgeous starfield into twisting blue and red light that glided like the colors on heated titanium.<br> <br>Those ripples of light were messages written in physics and perception. The information they offered would have seemed cryptic to most people. They would have seemed cryptic to me, twenty ans ago when I was but a wee slip of a person freshly skinned out and free of the clade I grew up in, Nyumba Yangu Haina Mlango. But I had a lot of practice reading their frequency and patterns now. Singer was . . . well, slowing wasn&#x2019;t exactly the right word, but it would do. We were, to coin a phrase, getting there.<br> <br>Singer couldn&#x2019;t navigate in white space. He could only follow the course planned and programmed beforehand, coasting like a surfer on a wave of space contracting before him and stretching out behind. He&#x2014;we&#x2014;were not even, technically speaking, moving, let alone moving particularly fast. The universe was just rearranging itself around us, invisible to those outside the bubble of the white field.<br> <br>Soon we would fold ourselves out of white space and into the normal universe. We were looking for a scar in space-time, the tiny ripple of radiation left by the passage of a ship whose course hadn&#x2019;t been tracked by any authority, and so when it had been lost, its loss had gone unnoticed for&#x2014;well, nobody could actually say how long. We were going there on purpose, and we planned to stay a while. Because somewhere down that Alcubierre-White rabbit hole in space-time there was&#x2014;or at least had been&#x2014;a ship. A lost ship.<br> <br>A misplaced one, anyway. We&#x2019;d taken on obligation for an information broker who provided us with scans and imaging they&#x2019;d obtained from the captain who had noticed the anomaly. They&#x2019;d also provided the anomaly&#x2019;s coordinates.<br> <br>The coordinates we&#x2019;d bid on were off the beaten path, perpendicular by a good distance from the inhabited and regularly traveled space lanes of the Milky Way. But we&#x2019;d been out this far before, and space was vast. Ships still got lost now and then, but they were usually better tracked these diar, and in the centuries since the white drive had turned space from an empty, intractable void permeated by loneliness and existential dread into a teeming, boisterous, and mostly peaceful community of species . . . much of the older salvage in the plane of the Milky Way had been picked clean.<br> <br>Bright ripples across the darkness narrowed, sharpened, resolved into bands, then blurs, then points of light. We fell into normal space and began to close the gap on our EMP engines. Through Singer&#x2019;s senso, I got a feel for the scar.<br> <br>It was a big one, and it looked fresh, which meant that the odds of the unlucky vessel that had caused it still being in there were pretty good. That would be nice, because our last two claims had come up empty, and the larder was a little bare. We hadn&#x2019;t even gotten any wreck-driving tourist contracts recently, which were risky&#x2014;especially the ones involving close approach to an event horizon&#x2014;but secretly a lot of fun.<br> <br>Connla liked them even more than I did.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wish I knew what the ship that found this thing was doing way the hell out here. There&#x2019;s literally nothing for light-ans in any direction.&#x201d; Connla, speaking to me through senso. He was up in the control cabin. It was supposed to be my rest shift. Sometimes, despite all the rightminding I can tolerate, I still have nightmares.<br> <br>I answered, &#x201c;If I had a nasty, suspicious mind . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Connla said. &#x201c;Pirates. Me too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know they don&#x2019;t like being called pirates,&#x201d; Singer joked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Freeloaders.&#x201d; Connla came from a world called Spartacus, notorious for its atavistic culture. One reason it was that way was because it sat so close to Freeport strongholds. Border brushfires and the constant threat of raids and one&#x2019;s shipping being picked off contributed to a martial culture. And I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to know this, but Connla had survived a pirate raid on an asteroid settlement when he was a child.<br> <br>I frowned at the scar. Singer&#x2019;s senses were designed for space, and his readouts told me that the scar was fresh. If there was a ship in there, and it was intact, and we could bring it home&#x2014;depending on what it was&#x2014;this whole trip would be worthwhile. We had an obligation to the Synarche that needed to be met, one way or another. We were spending resources to be here; resources the Synarche would want recouped and, ideally, built upon. The prize ship and its cargo were where that replacement value would come from.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be a smuggler,&#x201d; Connla said dourly.<br> <br>A bad outcome for our obligation if it was. Contraband was illegal goods or stolen art. Everything else a civilized galactic Synarche required was so easy to make, or ship, that there was no percentage in dodging around customs. If they were smuggling art, there might be forgiven obligations for recovering lost cultural treasures.<br> <br>There also might not.<br> <br>A pirate would be even more useless to us, beyond any value there might be in the hull. Some find the Galactic Synarche suffocating. And I have a healthy sympathy for the whole avoiding-suffocation thing. But there&#x2019;s asserting a reasonable individuality in the face of social norms, and then there&#x2019;s piracy and murder as an economic model.<br> <br>A hull could bring us some recovery credit. If it were in decent shape. Which pirate ships rarely were. But it wouldn&#x2019;t get us much else, because any cargo would likely be resources that, while valuable to those of us living in space within the Synarche, weren&#x2019;t valuable enough to go ferreting around in space-time pockets after.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;ll be a Wake-Seeker,&#x201d; I sent, cheerfully. Those who followed the Path of the Unfinished Work were always grateful for news of the fate of missing brethren. Even if, as they say, the authentic experience is an illusion.<br> <br>We were both really hoping that we might find a passenger vessel, commercial or private, that had wandered off course and gotten lost with no one the wiser as to its location. Those often offered finder&#x2019;s credit in the form of resource allocation validations to the salvager who retrieved them, both from the shipping line, the owners of registry of any cargo, and the families or clades of any passengers. And if there was unregistered cargo, that could be value along with the hull.<br> <br>Best of all were the packet vessels, which were full of information. And the ancient prizes from early exploration&#x2014;by any race&#x2014;that were treasure troves of archaeological data. That would be worth a few RAVs above the cost of the mission.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t even bother to consider the possibility that the hulk could be an ancient ship from a time long before that remembered by humans, or even any of the older syster species. I&#x2019;d heard about Koregoi ships with salvageable tech. I&#x2019;d never encountered one. Or even encountered anyone who admitted they had. But wouldn&#x2019;t it be nice . . . ?<br> <br>Well, that wouldn&#x2019;t be behind a fresh scar, anyway. So honestly I was just black-sky diadreaming, indulging myself in fantasies of untold wealth. Or of at least buying Singer out of copyright so he would own his own code.<br> <br>I was still on edge, and now it was too close to contact for me to bump my chems and get any restful sleep. Growing up clade&#x2014;and a flirtation with chemical dependency after I broke free&#x2014;had left me wary of the easy out, anyway, so I rarely thought of fixing the problem at the transmitter level when it was possible for me to ride it out.<br> <br>When I remembered, or Singer nagged me into it, I always wondered why I hadn&#x2019;t bumped earlier. Why I&#x2019;d been so resistant in the first place. And except for a few permanent mental health adjustments, I always insisted on a limited adjustment that would wear off in half a dia or so.<br> <br>Well, if people made sense, we&#x2019;d be like Singer.<br> <br>I turned away from the port. There would be a distraction of some sort in the command cabin, and I could caffeinate. Or bump, and tune for wakefulness since I&#x2019;d missed the shuttle on rest.<br> <br>I slid down the tunnel to the bridge headfirst, pushing off rungs in the tube with my fore- and afthands, avoiding bruising the lettuce and radishes growing along Singer&#x2019;s living walls. The ship&#x2019;s calico cats, Mephistopheles and Bushyasta, were floating in the tube, napping in a cuddle. Bushyasta, like the professional sleeper she was, had one set of claws hooked into the terry cloth of a grab loop. Mephistopheles was floating beside her, a red-and-white leg draped for an anchor over Bushyasta&#x2019;s belly, her black-splashed head cuddled on a mottled flank. Well, at least somebody was getting some rest around here.<br> <br>I glided the last meter or so&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t far: Singer really was a tiny bubble of a thing for frail warm meat to take to space in&#x2014;and found myself gazing at the back of Connla&#x2019;s head.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d anchored himself to a rail with his afthands, and his forehands were buried elbow-deep in the stuff of his console. His ponytail waved lazily behind him as he turned his head. I caught a glimpse of stubborn profile outlined against starfield and suppressed a smile.<br> <br>He started to say something, coughed, and corrected himself. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t sleep?&#x201d;<br> <br>I could have argued&#x2014;couldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;but I knew my unwillingness to tune my chem was opaque to Connla on an emotional level even when he professed to understand it intellectually. I thought he&#x2019;d actually maybe mellow and mature a bit if he didn&#x2019;t bump and tune so much to keep his responses calmed down to Spartacus&#x2019;s stoic ideals. On the other hand, I&#x2019;d have to put up with him finally experiencing adolescence, and that whole thing was such a mess I&#x2019;d turned mine off when it happened. Well, okay, a little bit after it happened. Some people have to learn the hard way, and apparently I am one of them.<br> <br>It was his brain and his chem and his business, so I just said, &#x201c;We should have pulled a permit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And let every other tug in the galaxy know where we were headed?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And have a chance of a rescue operation if we screw it up.&#x201d; I settled near my console, floating with one afthand resting lightly against a rail, and watched out the forward windows as ripples of light gathered and spread.<br> <br>Connla laughed. &#x201c;You put on such a rebel act, but I keep hearing your crï¿½che talking out of your mouth again and again. Anybody raised outside of a clade knows that it&#x2019;s easier to get forgiveness than permission. Besides, a permit isn&#x2019;t strictly legally necessary all the way out here. We&#x2019;re not in anybody&#x2019;s jurisdiction.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was transparent when he was baiting me. His own upbringing had left a few antisocial marks on him, but try to get him to admit that. If he hadn&#x2019;t been such a good guy from the DNA on up, he would have been insufferable. And quite possibly socially dangerous.<br> <br>&#x201c;Forgiveness is not the same thing as retroactive consent, Connla. And the research shows that people are much more altruistic when they&#x2019;re allowed to offer, instead of when something is demanded of them. There will be more red tape on the other end, this way.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t answer, so I said, &#x201c;How much longer?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ninety-seven seconds to the decel.&#x201d;<br> <br>My console felt cool and ready when I touched its carbonglas surface with my fingertips, just enough to stabilize, balance, and get a spherical perspective. I didn&#x2019;t bury my hands in my console the way Connla had, but I wasn&#x2019;t flying the bus.<br> <br>Well, okay, Singer was flying the bus. But Connla was directing, and he needed to be plugged in to Singer&#x2019;s full senso.<br> <br>A wide arc of stars swung below and behind Singer like the frozen skirts of a flamenco dancer: the Milky Way, seen from . . . not exactly outside, but far to one edge, and an angle. Scuttling fingers tap-danced up my spine at the sight of home, so far away. Which was ridiculous, because it wasn&#x2019;t home to me&#x2014;Singer was. And we were in no more danger here than anywhere else in space. Maybe even a little less than if we were camped in some cluttered, long-inhabited system full of meteors, traffic that couldn&#x2019;t follow a flight plan, and poorly mapped space junk.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a territorial mammal thing, is all. There&#x2019;s a sense of being long and far away from places you know your way around and have resources in that gets right up into the anxiety centers and made me feel lost and out of place.<br> <br>We were off our turf, and my amygdala knew it.<br> <br>Connla was cool and collected. I felt his calm through our link like a lapping sea. He didn&#x2019;t look over at me to roll his eyes, a demonstration of self-control better than I&#x2019;d have been able to manage. He&#x2019;d didn&#x2019;t have to tell me that he thought my resistance to tuning my mood was childish and irresponsible.<br> <br>But he hadn&#x2019;t grown up in a clade. He hadn&#x2019;t escaped a clade. And the hypervigilance was my friend. His friend, too, if he&#x2019;d ever admit it. Sure, it was uncomfortable. But that was a small price to pay for being ready. Getting caught by a disaster is bad enough. Getting caught by a disaster you didn&#x2019;t expect adds that layer of humiliation and stunned goggle-eyed frozenness to the proceedings, and that doesn&#x2019;t benefit you in the long run.<br> <br>All of those memories were stored in my fox, and I would have shared the ayatana with him if he&#x2019;d given me half an excuse. But he had never gotten past his childhood programming that feelings were sticky and somehow slightly revolting. So it was an element of our friendship that remained unexplored.<br> <br>And thus my uneasy feeling could have just been my old friend Uneasy Feeling, dropping by to see how things were shaking. It could have been that territorial fear of not knowing where I was, and where to find food, shelter, water, and my tribe. But it never hurt to be on your guard.<br> <br>Yep. Sleeping with one eye open, that&#x2019;s me. People only think it&#x2019;s ridiculous if they&#x2019;ve never been caught napping by an enemy. And the truth of the universe is that anybody can turn out to be an enemy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s keep the bubble up for now in case we have to move in a hurry,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Connla didn&#x2019;t argue. He cleared his throat and said, &#x201c;Singer, are you awake?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;More awake than you are,&#x201d; the ship replied. Most...</p><h2>St. Seraphim of Sarov</h2><p>Orthodox spirituality has produced many holy and famous men, but none in recent centuries to compare with Seraphim, staretz of the monastery of Sarov. After an initial period as a monk, working with the community, he was led to become a hermit, living deep in the forest in a world of solitude which was only destroyed when he was attacked by brigands. He returned to the community and in 1825, after fifteen years in silence, he began to receive visitors again and to spend his energies in their spiritual direction. By means of his faith and asceticism he performed a number of miracles. His fame and humility brought a steady stream of visitors, religious and royalty alike, to him for advice. His humility and concern for people made Sarov a center of pilgrimage until the events of the 1917 revolution. Zander has constructed this biography from the notebooks of people who knew him, the nuns whose spiritual director he became, the people whose lives he influenced, and the clergy who sought his advice. She adds to this information her own recollections of pilgrimages to Sarov before 1917. The life of the staretz is told with a touching simplicity which allows his life and work to be their own witnesses.All four books help to illumine the spiritual tradition so faithfully embodied in St Seraphim.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>A Slaying in the Suburbs: The Tara Grant Murder (Berkley True Crime)</h2><p><b>The true story of the Tara Grant murder.</b><br><br> To their suburban Detroit neighbors, Stephen and Tara Grant were happy as could be.

Our hero fiddles with some screws, adds a drop of oil, and plants himself on the saddle. He grasps a lever with both hands. He is going on a journey. And by the way so are we. When he throws that lever, time breaks from its moorings.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man is nondescript, almost devoid of features&#x2014;&#x201c;grey eyes&#x201d; and a &#x201c;pale face&#x201d; and not much else. He lacks even a name. He is just the Time Traveller: &#x201c;for so it will be convenient to speak of him.&#x201d; <i>Time </i>and <i>travel: </i>no one had thought to join those words before now. And that machine? With its saddle and bars, it&#x2019;s a fantasticated bicyï¿½cle. The whole thing is the invention of a young enthusiast named Wells, who goes by his initials, H. G., because he thinks that sounds more serious than Herbert. His family calls him Bertie. He is trying to be a writer. He is a thoroughly modern man, a believer in socialï¿½ism, free love, and bicycles. A proud member of the Cyclists&#x2019; Touring Club, he rides up and down the Thames valley on a forty-pounder with tubular frame and pneumatic tires, savoring the thrill of riding his machine: &#x201c;A memory of motion lingers in the muscles of your legs, and round and round they seem to go.&#x201d; At some point he sees a printed advertisement for a contraption called Hacker&#x2019;s Home Bicyï¿½cle: a stationary stand with rubber wheels to let a person pedal for exercise without going anywhere. Anywhere through space, that is. The wheels go round and time goes by.<br> &nbsp;<br> The turn of the twentieth century loomed&#x2014;a calendar date with apocalyptic resonance. Albert Einstein was a boy at gymnasium in Munich. Not till 1908 would the Polish-German mathematician Hermann Minkowski announce his radical idea: &#x201c;Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an indeï¿½pendent reality.&#x201d; H. G. Wells was there first, but unlike Minkowski, Wells was not trying to explain the universe. He was just trying to gin up a plausible-sounding plot device for a piece of fantastic storyï¿½telling.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nowadays we voyage through time so easily and so well, in our dreams and in our art. Time travel feels like an ancient tradition, rooted in old mythologies, old as gods and dragons. It isn&#x2019;t. Though the ancients imagined immortality and rebirth and lands of the dead time machines were beyond their ken. Time travel is a fantasy of the modern era. When Wells in his lamp-lit room imagined a time machine, he also invented a new mode of thought.<br> Why not before? And why now?<br> &nbsp;<br> ###<br> &nbsp;<br> The time traveller begins with a science lesson. Or is it just flummery? He gathers his friends around the drawing-room fire to explain that everything they know about time is wrong. They are stock characters from central casting: the Medical Man, the Psycholoï¿½gist, the Editor, the Journalist, the Silent Man, the Very Young Man, and the Provincial Mayor, plus everyone&#x2019;s favorite straight man, &#x201c;an argumentative person with red hair&#x201d; named Filby.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You must follow me carefully,&#x201d; the Time Traveller instructs these stick figures. &#x201c;I shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, that they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.&#x201d; School geometry&#x2014;Euclid&#x2019;s geometry&#x2014;had three dimensions, the ones we can see: length, width, and height.<br> &nbsp;<br> Naturally they are dubious. The Time Traveller proceeds Socratiï¿½cally. He batters them with logic. They put up feeble resistance.<br> &#x201c;You know of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness <i>nil, </i>has no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That is all right,&#x201d; said the Psychologist.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real existence.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There I object,&#x201d; said Filby. &#x201c;Of course a solid body may exist. All real things&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an <i>instantaï¿½neous </i>cube exist?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t follow you,&#x201d; said Filby [the poor sap].<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real existence?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Filby became pensive. &#x201c;Clearly,&#x201d; the Time Traveller proceeded, &#x201c;any real body must have extension in <i>four </i>directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and&#x2014;Duration.&#x201d;<br><br> ###<br> &nbsp;<br> Aha! The fourth dimension. A few clever Continental mathematiï¿½cians were already talking as though Euclid&#x2019;s three dimensions were not the be-all and end-all. There was August Mï¿½bius, whose famous &#x201c;strip&#x201d; was a two-dimensional surface making a twist through the third dimension, and Felix Klein, whose loopy &#x201c;bottle&#x201d; implied a fourth; there were Gauss and Riemann and Lobachevsky, all thinkï¿½ing, as it were, outside the box. For geometers the fourth dimension was an unknown direction at right angles to all our known directions. Can anyone visualize that? What direction is it? Even in the sevenï¿½teenth century, the English mathematician John Wallis, recognizing the algebraic possibility of higher dimensions, called them &#x201c;a Monï¿½ster in Nature, less possible than a Chimaera or Centaure.&#x201d; More and more, though, mathematics found use for concepts that lacked physiï¿½cal meaning. They could play their parts in an abstract world without necessarily describing features of reality.<br> &nbsp;<br> Under the influence of these geometers, a schoolmaster named Edwin Abbott Abbott published his whimsical little novel <i>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions </i>in 1884, in which two-dimensional creatures try to wrap their minds around the possibility of a third; and in 1888 Charles Howard Hinton, a son-in-law of the logician George Boole, invented the word <i>tesseract </i>for the four-dimensional analogue of the cube. The four-dimensional space this object encloses he called hypervolume. He populated it with hypercones, hyper pyramids, and hyperspheres. Hinton titled his book, not very modestly, <i>A New Era of Thought. </i>He suggested that this mysterious, not-quite-visible fourth dimension might provide an answer to the mystery of consciousness. &#x201c;We must be really four-dimensional creatures, or we could not think about four dimensions,&#x201d; he reasoned. To make mental models of the world and of ourselves, we must have special brain molecules: &#x201c;It may be that these brain molecules have the power of four-dimensional movement, and that they can go through four-dimensional movements and form four-dimensional structures.&#x201d; For a while in Victorian England the fourth dimension served as a catchall, a hideaway for the mysterious, the unseen, the spiritual&#x2014;anything that seemed to be lurking just out of sight. Heaven might be in the fourth dimension; after all, astronomers with their telescopes were not finding it overhead. The fourth dimension was a secret compartment for fantasists and occultists. &#x201c;We are on the eve of the Fourth Dimension; that is what it is!&#x201d; declared William T. Stead, a muckraking journalist who had been editor of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette, </i>in 1893. He explained that this could be expressed by mathematical formulas and could be imagined (&#x201c;if you have a vivid imagination&#x201d;) but could not actually be seen&#x2014;anyway not &#x201c;by mortal man.&#x201d; It was a place &#x201c;of which we catch glimpses now and then in those phenomena which are entirely unaccountable for by any law of three-dimensional space.&#x201d; For example, clairvoyance. Also telepathy. He submitted his report to the Psychical Research Society for their further investigaï¿½tion. Nineteen years later he embarked on the <i>Titanic </i>and drowned at sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> By comparison Wells is so sober, so simple. No mysticism for him&#x2014;the fourth dimension is not a ghost world. It is not heaven, nor is it hell. It is time.<br> &nbsp;<br> What is time? Time is nothing but one more direction, orthogonal to the rest. As simple as that. It&#x2019;s just that no one has been able to see it till now&#x2014;till the Time Traveller. &#x201c;Through a natural infirmity of the flesh . . . we incline to overlook this fact,&#x201d; he coolly explains. <i>&#x201c;There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it.&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> In surprisingly short order this notion would become part of the orthodoxy of theoretical physics.</p><h2>The Twilight Zone Scripts of Earl Hamner</h2><p>The Twilight Zone has evolved from a groundbreaking speculative television series into a cultural phenomenon. The recently revived series on FOX averaged 4.6 million viewers on its first episode. Indeed, the title itself conjures up thoughts of fantastic stories that bridge several forms of fiction to create a unique genre of morality tales with a touch of irony, unlimited by the boundaries of conventional fiction. Broadcast from 1959 to 1964, the show has run ever since in syndication, making it one of the longest running television shows of all time, creating a new genre of shows similar to the X-Files and Twin Peaks. Five writers created the core of the show, and together these men fashioned the bulk of the 156 original episodes: Rod Serling, Richard Matheson, Charles Beaumont, George Clayton Johnson, and Earl Hamner. All went on to other projects in film, television, theater, and print, but their involvement in the Twilight Zone is well known to fans of the series. The Twilight Zone Scripts of Earl Hamner contains reprints of the eight episodes written by Hamner, along with Albarella&#39;s commentary on each story: The Hunt, &#34;&#34; &#34;&#34;A Piano in the House, &#34;&#34; &#34;&#34;Jess-Belle, &#34;&#34; &#34;&#34;Ring-a-Ding Girl, &#34;&#34; &#34;&#34;You Drive, &#34;&#34; &#34;&#34;Black Leather Jackets, &#34;&#34; &#34;&#34;Stopover in a Quiet Town, &#34;&#34; and &#34;&#34;The Bewitchin&#39; Pool.&#34;&#34; Also included is a &#34;&#34;lost&#34;&#34; Twilight Zone short story by Mr. Hamner and an interview with Albarella that covers the background details of how Hamner became involved in the series.&#34;&#34;</p><p>EARL HAMNER is best known as the creator and producer of the Emmy Award-winning series The Waltons.

Then I'll live in squalor in a Bronx tenement, where the toilet is shared by four apartments! My shirts will go unironed, my tie will be perpetually awry. <i>See what you've done to me?"</i></p><p>But when he told Alice about the apartment, she only laughed bitterly and said, "Not anymore, Howard. I won't play those games with you. You win every damn time."</p><p>She pretended not to care about him anymore, but Howard knew better. He knew people, knew what they wanted, and Alice wanted <i>him</i>. It was his strongest card in their relationship--that she wanted him more than he wanted her. He thought of this often: at work in the offices of Humboldt and Breinhardt, Designers; at lunch in a cheap lunchroom (part of the punishment); on the subway home to his tenement (Alice had kept the Lincoln Continental). He thought and thought about how much she wanted him. But he kept remembering what she had said the day she threw him out: If you ever come near Rhiannon again I'll kill you.</p><p>He could not remember why she had said that. Could not remember and did not try to remember because that line of thinking made him uncomfortable and one thing Howard insisted on being was comfortable with himself. Other people could spend hours and days of their lives chasing after some accommodation with themselves, but Howard was accommodated. Well adjusted. At ease. I'm OK, I'm OK, I'm OK. Hell with you. "If you let them make you feel uncomfortable," Howard would often say, "you give them a handle on you and they can run your life." Howard could find other people's handles, but they could never find Howard's.</p><p>It was not yet winter but cold as hell at three A.M. when Howard got home from Stu's party. A must attend party, if you wished to get ahead at Humboldt and Breinhardt. Stu's ugly wife tried to be tempting, but Howard had played innocent and made her feel so uncomfortable that she dropped the matter. Howard paid careful attention to office gossip and knew that several earlier departures from the company had got caught with, so to speak, their pants down. Not that Howard's pants were an impenetrable barrier. He got Dolores from the front office into the bedroom and accused her of making life miserable for him. "In little ways," he insisted. "I know you don't mean to, but you've got to stop."</p><p>"What ways?" Dolores asked, incredulous yet (because she honestly tried to make other people happy) uncomfortable.</p><p>"Surely you knew how attracted I am to you."</p><p>"No. That hasn't--that hasn't even crossed my mind."</p><p>Howard looked tongue-tied, embarrassed. He actually was neither. "Then--well, then, I was--I was wrong, I'm sorry, I thought you were doing it deliberately--"</p><p>"Doing what?"</p><p>"Snub--snubbing me--never mind, it sounds adolescent, just little things, hell, Dolores, I had a stupid schoolboy crush--"</p><p>"Howard, I didn't even know I was hurting you."</p><p>"God, how insensitive," Howard said, sounding even more hurt.</p><p>"Oh, Howard, do I mean that much to you?"</p><p>Howard made a little whimpering noise that meant everything she wanted it to mean. She looked uncomfortable. She'd do anything to get back to feeling right with herself again. She was so uncomfortable that they spent a rather nice half hour making each other feel comfortable again. No one else in the office had been able to get to Dolores. But Howard could get to anybody.</p><p>He walked up the stairs to his apartment feeling very, very satisfied. Don't need you, Alice, he said to himself. Don't need nobody, and nobody's who I've got. He was still mumbling the little ditty to himself as he went into the communal bathroom and turned on the light.</p><p>He heard a gurgling sound from the toilet stall, a hissing sound. Had someone been in there with the light off? Howard went into the toilet stall and saw nobody. Then looked closer and saw a baby, probably about two months old, lying in the toilet bowl. Its nose and eyes were barely above the water; it looked terrified, its legs and hips and stomach were down the drain. Someone had obviously hoped to kill it by drowning--it was inconceivable to Howard that anyone could be so moronic as to think it would fit down the drain.</p><p>For a moment he thought of leaving it there, with the big-city temptation to mind one's own business even when to do so would be an atrocity. Saving this baby would mean inconvenience: calling the police, taking care of the child in his apartment, perhaps even headlines, certainly a night of filling out reports. Howard was tired. Howard wanted to go to bed.</p><p>But he remembered Alice saying, "You aren't even human, Howard. You're a goddam selfish monster." I am not a monster, he answered silently, and reached down into the toilet bowl to pull the child out.</p><p>The baby was firmly jammed in--whoever had tried to kill it had meant to catch it tight. Howard felt a brief surge of genuine indignation that anyone could think to solve his problems by killing an innocent child. But thinking of crimes committed on children was something Howard was determined not to do, and besides, at that moment he suddenly acquired other things to think about.</p><p>As the child clutched at Howard's arm, he noticed the baby's fingers were fused together into flipperlike flaps of bone and skin at the end of the arm. Yet the flippers gripped his arms with an unusual strength as, with two hands deep in the toilet bowl, Howard tried to pull the baby free.</p><p>At last, with a gush, the child came up and the water finished its flushing action. The legs, too, were fused into a single limb that was hideously twisted at the end. The child was male; the genitals, larger than normal, were skewed off to one side. And Howard noticed that where the feet should be were two more flippers, and near the tips were red spots that looked like putrefying sores. The child cried, a savage mewling that reminded Howard of a dog he had seen in its death throes. (Howard refused to be reminded that it had been he who killed the dog by throwing it out in the street in front of a passing car, just to watch the driver swerve; the driver hadn't swerved.)</p><p>Even the hideously deformed have a right to live, Howard thought, but now, holding the child in his arms, he felt a revulsion that translated into sympathy for whoever, probably the parents, had tried to kill the creature. The child shifted its grip on him, and where the flippers had been Howard felt a sharp, stinging pain that quickly turned to agony as it was exposed to the air. Several huge, gaping sores on his arm were already running with blood and pus.</p><p>It took a moment for Howard to connect the sores with the child, and by then the leg flippers were already pressed against his stomach, and the arm flippers already gripped his chest. The sores on the child's flippers were not sores; they were powerful suction devices that gripped Howard's skin so tightly that it ripped away when the contact was broken. He tried to pry the child off, but no sooner was one flipper free than it found a new place to hold even as Howard struggled to break the grip of another.</p><p>What had begun as an act of charity had now become an intense struggle. This was not a child, Howard realized. Children could not hang on so tightly, and the creature had teeth that snapped at his hands and arms whenever they came near enough. A human face, certainly, but not a human being. Howard threw himself against the wall, hoping to stun the creature so it would drop away. It only clung tighter, and the sores where it hung on him hurt more. But at last Howard pried and scraped it off by levering it against the edge of the toilet stall. It dropped to the ground, and Harold backed quickly away, on fire with the pain of a dozen or more stinging wounds.</p><p>It had to be a nightmare. In the middle of the night, in a bathroom lighted by a single bulb, with a travesty of humanity writhing on the floor, Howard could not believe that it had any reality.</p><p>Could it be a mutation that had somehow lived? Yet the thing had far more purpose, far more control of its body than any human infant. The baby slithered across the floor as Howard, in pain from the wounds on his body, watched in a panic of indecision. The baby reached the wall and cast a flipper onto it. The suction held and the baby began to inch its way straight up the wall. As it climbed, it defecated, a thin drool of green tracing down the wall behind it. Howard looked at the slime following the infant up the wall, looked at the pus-covered sores on his arms.</p><p>What if the animal, whatever it was, did not die soon of its terrible deformity? What if it lived? What if it were found, taken to a hospital, cared for? What if it became an adult?</p><p>It reached the ceiling and made the turn, clinging tightly to the plaster, not falling off as it hung upside down and inched across toward the light bulb.</p><p>The thing was trying to get directly over Howard, and the defecation was still dripping. Loathing overcame fear, and Howard reached up, took hold of the baby from the back, and, using his full weight, was finally able to pry it off the ceiling. It writhed and twisted in his hands, trying to get the suction cups on him, but Howard resisted with all his strength and was able to get the baby, this time headfirst, into the toilet bowl. He held it there until the bubbles stopped and it was blue. Then he went back to his apartment for a knife. Whatever the creature was, it had to disappear from the face of the earth. It had to die, and there had to be no sign left that could hint that Howard had killed it.</p><p>He found the knife quickly, but paused for a few moments to put something on his wounds. They stung bitterly, but in a while they felt better. Howard took off his shirt; thought a moment and took off all his clothes, then put on his bathrobe and took a towel with him as he returned to the bathroom. He didn't want to get any blood o...</p></p><h2>Stones to Stains: The Drawings of Victor Hugo</h2><p><b>Focusing on the little-known but remarkable drawings of Victor Hugo, this book sheds light on the novelist, poet, and playwright's artistic practice and creative brilliance.</b><br><br>Accompanying a major exhibition, this book brings together around 120 of the most significant examples of Victor Hugo's works on paper. It features previously unpublished drawings and insightful texts that reveal Hugo's extraordinary talents as a draftsman. Remarkably spontaneous and receptive to the myriad possibilities of medium and materials, Hugo produced experimental and enigmatic compositions, from haunting renditions of castles and ruins to ethereal and abstract forms and stains. This volume includes essays which place Hugo's drawings within the context of artistic movements in 19th-century France, closely examine his cosmic landscapes and visions of the night, delve into Hugo's processing of ideas and imagination, and analyze a central pair of opposing forces in his work--stones and stains. This lavishly illustrated book presents the full breadth of Hugo's talent. Hugo's drawings afford a greater insight into the creative brilliance that brought forth some of the most indelible stories of all time.<br><b>Copublished by the Hammer Museum and DelMonico Books</b></p><p>CYNTHIA BURLINGHAM is Deputy Director of Curatorial Affairs at the Hammer Museum.

It is difficult to know what is important and what is not, and when specific knowledge is vital, or when a more general understanding is sufficient. Tragically often, once the opening is over, a player won't know what plan to follow, or even understand why his pieces are on the squares on which they sit.<br> <br>In this highly-acclaimed and popular series, John Watson helps chess-players achieve a more holistic and insightful view of the openings. He explains not only the ideas and strategies behind specific openings, but also the interconnections of chess openings taken as a whole. By presenting the common threads that underlie opening play, Watson provides a permanent basis for playing openings of any type.<br> <br>This third volume focuses on the English Opening while also drawing together many threads from the first two books in a wide-ranging discussion of general opening topics. Particularly in the context of reversed and analogous forms of standard structures, we understand why certain ideas work and others don't, and experience the concept of 'Cross-Pollination' at work in even more varied forms than seen in the first two volumes.<br> <br></p><p><br>International Master John Watson is one of the world's most respected writers on chess. His groundbreaking four-volume work on the English firmly established his reputation in the 1980s, and he has produced a string of top-quality works since. In 1999, <i>Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy</i>, Watson's first book for Gambit, won the British Chess Federation Book of the Year Award and the United States Chess Federation Fred Cramer Award for Best Book. He reviews chess books for The Week in Chess and hosts a weekly radio show on the Internet Chess Club.<br> <br></p><h2>Pastoring Men: What Works, What Doesn&#39;t, and Why Men&#39;s Discipleship Matters Now More Than Ever</h2><p><p><b>What would happen if every pastor in America shared the vision to disciple every man in his church&#x2014;can you imagine? </b></p><p>No man falls on purpose, yet our culture is suffering from the fallout of the "men problem."

Throughout his career, Andy Warhol easily crossed the boundaries between fine art and graphic design; in fact, he made no distinction between art and advertising. Posters were a natural medium for this talented artist, and he was much in demand to promote some of the most renowned celebrities, causes, and brands of his time. This richly illustrated catalogue raisonnï¿½ surveys every Warhol poster commissioned for a specific purpose and featuring original artwork. Arranged chronologically, they present a fascinating array of subjects, including cultural events, musicians, politics, and iconic brands. Each of the posters is exquisitely reproduced, including some with multiple variations, and accompanied by informative texts and comparative illustrations. The author&#x2019;s introductory essay offers a brief history of poster art and contextualizes Warhol&#x2019;s output against masters of the form such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Keith Haring. Seen in their entirety, these posters&#x2015;bearing all the hallmarks of the artist&#x2019;s finest work&#x2015;both reflect and reveal the cultural zeitgeist that drove Warhol&#x2019;s innovative practice.</p><p>Paul Marechal is a curator and art collector based in Montreal.

Nina is a precocious and wide-eyed young girl who holds the keys to the entire hotel, wonders what it means to be a princess, and will irrevocably change his life. Despite being confined to the hallway of the hotel, the Count lives an absorbing, adventure-filled existence, filled with capers, conspiracies and culture. Alexander Rostov is a character for the ages--like Kay Thompson&#x2019;s Eloise and Wes Anderson&#x2019;s M. Gustav, he is unflinchingly (and hilariously for readers) devoted to his station, even when forced to wait tables, play hide and seek with a young girl, or confront communism. Towles magnificently conjures the grandeur of the Russian hotel and the vibrancy of the characters that call it home. <em>--Al Woodworth, The Amazon Book Review</em>Born and raised in the Boston area,&nbsp;Amor Towles&nbsp;graduated from Yale College and received an MA in English from Stanford University.

Unpredictable to the last page, <i>Smilla's Sense of</i> <i>Snow </i>is one of the most beautifully written and original crime stories of our time, a new classic.</p></p><p>In this international bestseller, Peter Hï¿½eg successfully combines the pleasures of literary fiction with those of the thriller. Smilla Jaspersen, half Danish, half Greenlander, attempts to understand the death of a small boy who falls from the roof of her apartment building. Her childhood in Greenland gives her an appreciation for the complex structures of snow, and when she notices that the boy's footprints show he <i>ran</i> to his death, she decides to find out who was chasing him. As she attempts to solve the mystery, she uncovers a series of conspiracies and cover-ups and quickly realizes that she can trust nobody. Her investigation takes her from the streets of Copenhagen to an icebound island off the coast of Greenland. What she finds there has implications far beyond the death of a single child. The unusual setting, gripping plot, and compelling central character add up to one of the most fascinating and literate thrillers of recent years."Splendid entertainment...The suspense novel as exploration of the heart."<br><i>--The New York Times Book Review</i><p>"Astonishing."<br><i>--Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>"A superbly constructed thriller...A combination of suspense narrative, Hemingwayeque prose, exotic setting and spellbinding central female."<br><i>--People</i></p><p>"A book of profound intelligence...in the league of Melville or Conrad.

An underground classic among corporate executives, accountants, and entrepreneurs since the 1970s, it is rooted in the author's commitment to right livelihood, to learning how the world works, to a willingness to "fail young," and to networking. Phillips shows how to combine these principles with the seven laws to engender a healthy, fearless attitude toward money.</p><p>Michael Phillips developed MasterCard as vice president of the Bank of California. He is the author of <i>Honest Business </i>and <i>The Seven Laws of Money. </i>The author/reader has some good ideas about why people get into trouble with money, along with advice and friendly insights that will make sense to most people right away. He gives listeners a deeper understanding of their bad habits, rather than just telling them what to do. There's a healing component to all of this, and perhaps a bit of redemption, all of it low-key, easy to listen to and consider. Because the focus is on becoming aware of and relaxed with one's money habits, the author's voice is a good fitï¿½calm but not too Zen-like, and not at all pedantic. This enjoyable program encourages openness to new learning about one's relationship with money.

Although the Indian community of Celilo Village survives to this day as Oregon's oldest continuously inhabited town, with the construction of The Dalles Dam in 1957, traditional uses of the river were catastrophically interrupted. Most non-Indians celebrated the new generation of hydroelectricity and the easy navigability of the river "highway" created by the dam, but Indians lost a sustaining center to their lives when Celilo Falls was inundated.<br><br><i>Death of Celilo Falls</i> is a story of ordinary lives in extraordinary circumstances, as neighboring communities went through tremendous economic, environmental, and cultural change in a brief period.

As if the phrase &#x201c;short back and sides, with a little bit off the top&#x201d; might mean something different in this new suburb. He&#x2019;d doubted it. Everything else seemed the same: the torture chair, the surgical smells, the strop and the folded razor &#x2014; folded not in safety but in threat. Most of all, the torturer-in-chief was the same, a loony with big hands who pushed your head down till your windpipe nearly snapped, who prodded your ear with a bamboo finger. &#x201c;General inspection, madam?&#x201d; he said greasily when he&#x2019;d finished. His mother had shaken off the effects of her magazine and stood up. &#x201c;Very nice,&#x201d; she said vaguely, leaning over him, smelling of stuff. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send him by himself next time.&#x201d; Outside, she had rubbed his cheek, looked at him with idle eyes, and murmured, &#x201c;You poor shorn lamb.&#x201d;<br><br>Now he was on his own. As he walked past the estate agent&#x2019;s, the sports shop and the half-timbered bank, he practised saying, &#x201c;Short back and sides with a little bit off the top.&#x201d; He said it urgently, without the comma; you had to get the words just right, like a prayer. There was one and threepence in his pocket; he stuffed his handkerchief in tighter to keep the coins safe. He didn&#x2019;t like not being allowed to be afraid. It was simpler at the dentist&#x2019;s: your mother always came with you, the dentist always hurt you, but afterwards he gave you a boiled sweet for being a good boy, and then back in the waiting room you pretended in front of the other patients that you were made of stern stuff. Your parents were proud of you. &#x201c;Been in the wars, old chap?&#x201d; his father would ask. Pain let you into the world of grown-up phrases. The dentist would say, &#x201c;Tell your father you&#x2019;re fit for overseas. He&#x2019;ll understand.&#x201d; So he&#x2019;d go home and Dad would say, &#x201c;Been in the wars, old chap?&#x201d; and he&#x2019;d answer, &#x201c;Mr. Gordon says I&#x2019;m fit for overseas.&#x201d;<br><br>He felt almost important going in, with the adult spring of the door against his hand. But the barber merely nodded, pointed with his comb to the line of high-backed chairs, and resumed his standing crouch over a white-haired geezer. Gregory sat down. His chair creaked. Already he wanted to pee. There was a bin of magazines next to him, which he didn&#x2019;t dare explore. He gazed at the hamster nests of hair on the floor.<br><br>When his turn came, the barber slipped a thick rubber cushion onto the seat. The gesture looked insulting: he&#x2019;d been in long trousers now for ten and a half months. But that was typical: you were never sure of the rules, never sure if they tortured everyone the same way, or if it was just you. Like now: the barber was trying to strangle him with the sheet, pulling it tight round his neck, then shoving a cloth down inside his collar. &#x201c;And what can we do for you today, young man?&#x201d; The tone implied that such an ignominious and deceitful woodlouse as he obviously was might have strayed into the premises for any number of different reasons.<br><br>After a pause, Gregory said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like a haircut, please.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;d say you&#x2019;d come to the right place, wouldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; The barber tapped him on the crown with his comb; not painfully, but not lightly either.<br><br>&#x201c;Short-back-and-sides-with-a-little-bit-off-the-top-please.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now we&#x2019;re motoring,&#x201d; said the barber.<br><br>They would only do boys at certain times of the week. There was a notice saying No Boys on Saturday Mornings. Saturday afternoons they were closed anyway, so it might just as well read No Boys on Saturdays. Boys had to go when men didn&#x2019;t want to. At least, not men with jobs. He went at times when the other customers were pensioners. There were three barbers, all of middle age, in white coats, dividing their time between the young and the old. They greased up to these throat-clearing old geezers, made mysterious conversation with them, put on a show of being keen on their trade. The old geezers wore coats and scarves even in summer, and gave tips as they left. Gregory would watch the transaction out of the corner of his eye. One man giving another man money, a secret half-handshake with both pretending the exchange wasn&#x2019;t being made.<br><br>Boys didn&#x2019;t tip. Perhaps that was why barbers hated boys. They paid less and they didn&#x2019;t tip. They also didn&#x2019;t keep still. Or at least, their mothers told them to keep still, they kept still, but this didn&#x2019;t stop the barber bashing their heads with a palm as solid as the flat of a hatchet and muttering, &#x201c;Keep still.&#x201d; There were stories of boys who&#x2019;d had the tops of their ears sliced off because they hadn&#x2019;t kept still. Razors were called cut-throats. All barbers were loonies.<br><br>&#x201c;Wolf cub, are we?&#x201d; It took Gregory a while to realize that he was being addressed. Then he didn&#x2019;t know whether to keep his head down or look up in the mirror at the barber. Eventually he kept his head down and said, &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Boy scout already?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Crusader?&#x201d;<br><br>Gregory didn&#x2019;t know what that meant. He started to lift his head, but the barber rapped his crown with the comb. &#x201c;Keep <i>still</i>, I said.&#x201d; Gregory was so scared of the loony that he was unable to answer, which the barber took as a negative. &#x201c;Very fine organization, the Crusaders. You give it a thought.&#x201d;<br><br>Gregory thought of being chopped up by curved Saracen swords, of being staked out in the desert and eaten alive by ants and vultures. Meanwhile, he submitted to the cold smoothness of the scissors &#x2014; always cold even when they weren&#x2019;t. Eyes tight shut, he endured the tickly torment of hair falling on his face. He sat there, still not looking, convinced that the barber should have stopped cutting ages ago, except that he was such a loony he would probably carry on cutting and cutting until Gregory was bald. Still to come was the stropping of the razor, which meant that your throat was going to be cut; the dry, scrapy feel of the blade next to your ears and on the back of your neck; the fly-whisk shoved into your eyes and nose to get the hair out.<br><br>Those were the bits that made you wince every time. But there was also something creepier about the place. He suspected it was rude. Things you didn&#x2019;t know about, or weren&#x2019;t meant to know about, usually turned out to be rude. Like the barber&#x2019;s pole. That was obviously rude. The previous place just had an old bit of painted wood with colours twirling round it. The one here worked by electricity, and moved in whirly circles all the time. That was ruder, he thought. Then there was the binful of magazines. He was sure some of them were rude. Everything was rude if you wanted it to be. This was the great truth about life which he&#x2019;d only just discovered. Not that he minded. Gregory liked rude things.<br><br>Without moving his head, he looked in the next-door mirror at a pensioner two seats away. He&#x2019;d been yakking on in the sort of loud voice old geezers always had. Now the barber was bent over him with a small pair of round-headed scissors, cutting hairs out of his eyebrows. Then he did the same with his nostrils; then his ears. Snipping great twigs out of his lugholes. Absolutely disgusting. Finally, the barber started brushing powder into the back of the geezer&#x2019;s neck. What was that for?<br><br>Now the torturer-in-chief had the clippers out. That was another bit Gregory didn&#x2019;t like. Sometimes they used hand-clippers, like tin-openers, squeak grind squeak grind round the top of his skull till his brains were opened up. But these were the buzzer-clippers, which were even worse, because you could get electrocuted from them. He&#x2019;d imagined it hundreds of times. The barber buzzes away, doesn&#x2019;t notice what he&#x2019;s doing, hates you anyway because you&#x2019;re a boy, cuts a wodge off your ear, the blood pours all over the clippers, they get a short-circuit and you&#x2019;re electrocuted on the spot. Must have happened millions of times. And the barber always survived because he wore rubber-soled shoes.<br><br>At school they swam naked. Mr. Lofthouse wore a pouch-thing so they couldn&#x2019;t see his whanger. The boys took off all their clothes, had a shower for lice or verrucas or something, or being smelly in the case of Wood, then jumped into the pool. You leaped up high and landed with the water hitting your balls. That was rude, so you didn&#x2019;t let the master see you doing it. The water made your balls all tight, which made your willy stick out more, and afterwards they towelled themselves dry and looked at one another without looking, sort of sideways, like in the mirror at the barber&#x2019;s. Everyone in the class was the same age, but some were still bald down there; some, like Gregory, had a sort of bar of hair across the top but nothing on their balls; and some, like Hopkinson and Shapiro, were as hairy as men already, and a darker colour, brownish, like Dad&#x2019;s when he&#x2019;d peeped round the side of a stand-up. At least he had <i>some</i> hair, not like Baldy Bristowe and Hall and Wood. But how did Hopkinson and Shapiro get like that? Everyone else had willies; Hopkinson and Shapiro already had whangers.<br><br>He wanted to pee. He couldn&#x2019;t. He mustn&#x2019;t think about peeing. He could hold out till he got home. The Crusaders fought the Saracens and delivered the Holy Land from the Infidel. Like Infidel Castro, sir? That was one of Wood&#x2019;s jokes. They wore crosses on their surcoats. Chainmail must have been hot in Israel. He must stop thinking that he could win a gold medal in a peeing-high-against-a-wall competition.<br><br>&#x201c;Local?&#x201d; said the barber suddenly. Gregory looked at him in the mirror for the first proper time. Red face, little moustache, glasses, yellowy hair the colour of a school ruler. <i>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes</i>, they&#x2019;d been taught. So who barbers barbers? You could tell this one was a perve as well as a loony. Everyone knew there were millions of perves out there. The swimming master was a perve. After the lesson, when they were shivering in their towels with their balls all tight and their willies plus two whangers sticking out, Mr. Lofthouse would walk the length of the poolside, climb on to the springboard, pause till he had their full attention, with his huge muscles and tattoo and arms out and pouch with strings round his buttocks, then take a deep breath, dive in and glide underwater the length of the pool. Twenty-five yards underwater. Then he&#x2019;d touch and surface and they&#x2019;d all applaud &#x2014; not that they really meant it &#x2014; but he&#x2019;d ignore them and practise different strokes. He was a perve. Most of the masters were probably perves. There was one who wore a wedding-ring. That proved he was.<br><br>And so was this one. &#x201c;Do you live locally?&#x201d; he was saying again. Gregory wasn&#x2019;t falling for that. He&#x2019;d be coming round to sign him up for the Scouts or the Crusaders. Then he&#x2019;d be asking Mum if he could take Gregory camping in the woods &#x2014; except there&#x2019;d only be one tent, and he&#x2019;d tell Gregory stories about bears, and even though they&#x2019;d done geography and he knew bears died out in Britain at about the time of the Crusades, he&#x2019;d half-believe it if the perve told him there was a bear.<br><br>&#x201c;Not for long,&#x201d; Gregory replied. That wasn&#x2019;t too clever, he knew at once. They&#x2019;d only just moved here. The barber would say sneery things to him when he kept on coming in, for years and years and years. Gregory flicked a glance up at the mirror, but the perve wasn&#x2019;t giving anything away. He was doing an absent-minded last snip. Then he dug into Gregory&#x2019;s collar and shook it to make sure as much hair as possible fell down inside his shirt. &#x201c;Think about the Crusaders,&#x201d; he said, as he started pulling out the sheet. &#x201c;It might suit you.&#x201d;<br><br>Gregory saw himself reborn from beneath the shroud, unchanged except that his ears now stuck out more. He started to slide forward on the rubber cushion. The comb snapped against his crown, harder now that he had less hair.<br><br>&#x201c;Not so fast, young fellow-me-lad.&#x201d; The barber ambled down the length of the narrow shop and came back with an oval mirror like a tray. He dipped it to show the back of Gregory&#x2019;s head. Gregory looked into the first mirror, into the second mirror, and out the other side. That wasn&#x2019;t the back of his head. It didn&#x2019;t look like that. He felt himself blush. He wanted to pee. The perve was showing him the back of someone else&#x2019;s head. Black magic. Gregory stared and stared, his colour getting brighter, staring at the back of someone else&#x2019;s head, all shaved and sculpted, until he realized that the only way to get home was to play the perve&#x2019;s game, so he took a final glance at the alien skull, looked boldly higher up the mirror at the barber&#x2019;s indifferent spectacles, and said, quietly, &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><h2>Prefabulous + Almost Off the Grid: Your Path to Building an Energy-Independent Home</h2><p>Prefabrication offers a simple path to the green home of your dreams, and in her latest book, <i>Prefabulous </i>author Sheri Koones highlights the many ways of using prefabrication to create almost-off-the-grid homes&#x2015;houses that are not only environmentally friendly but often operate at nearly zero annual energy cost.<br> Taking energy from the grid when necessary and returning any excess energy produced, almost-off-the-grid homes function on a fraction of the energy required by most houses, and additionally are more comfortable, healthier, quieter inside, and far cheaper to operate.

Simply put, it ends in disaster.</p> <p>Drawing on stories and examples from throughout modern political history&#x2014;from Napoleon's invasion of Russia to the impending collapse of the American healthcare system, from the outbreak of WWII and the fall of the Third Reich to the 21st century War on Terror, from the Great Recession to the sovereign debt crisis&#x2014;Bonner pursues a modest ambition: to understand what goes wrong. </p> <p>History is not a clean yarn spun by its victors. It is a long tale of things that went FUBAR&#x2014;debacles, disasters, and catastrophes. That each disaster carries with it a warning is what makes it useful to study. For instance, if the architect of a great ship tells you that &#x2018;not even God himself could sink this ship,' you should take the next boat. If the stock market is selling at 20 times earnings and all the expert analysts urge you to &#x2018;get in&#x2019; because you &#x2018;can&#x2019;t lose&#x2019;&#x2014;it&#x2019;s time to get out!</p> <p>Similarly, public policy disasters are what you get when well meaning people with this same Titanic degree of certitude apply rational, small-scale problem-solving logic to inappropriately large scale planning. First, you get a declining rate of return on your investment (of time or resources) until you hit zero. Then, if you keep going through the zero floor&#x2014;and you always keep going&#x2014;you get a disaster.</p> <p>The problem is, these disasters cannot be stopped by well-informed smart people with good intentions, because they are the people who cause them in the first place.</p> <p>From the mind of Bill Bonner comes Hormegeddon, a phenomenon that occurs when a small dose of something produces a favorable result, but if you increase the dosage, the results end in disaster. The same applies when the world gets too much of a good thing in public policy, economics, and business. Drawing on examples throughout modern political history, Bonner brings context and understanding to this largely ignored and anonymous phenomenon.</p></p><p>Bill Bonner is the co-author of the New York Times Best Selling books Financial Reckoning Day: Surviving the Soft Depression of the 21st Century, Empire of Debt: The Rise of an Epic Financial Crisis, and Mobs, Messiahs, and Markets: Surviving the Public Spectacle in Finance and Politics.

It exposes the problem of naive interventionism, the iatrogenics of bureaucracies, and the growing absence of skin-in-the-game (Hammurabi's problem), in addition to the deformities of the modern state, and shows how such a system is bound to explode under the weight of fragility. It is deep, illustrative, witty, pleasant to read. Buy two copies, one for yourself, another for the nearest policy maker." - Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Distinguished Professor of Risk Engining, NYU, author of The Black Swan and Antifragile. <br><br>"I am seldom jealous of anybody, but I truly envy Bill Bonner's writing and intellectual skills. I read his notes every day because of his perfect prose and his deep insights into economics, and investment markets. But, Hormegeddon, is by far the best Bonner ever produced. It is funny, cynic, sarcastic, highly informative, beautifully written, entertaining, and most importantly, written by a man who is not afraid to tell the truth, and stand up for it. I do not say this often, but when I read his Hormegeddon, I was truly in awe." - Marc Faber, publisher of the Gloom Boom &amp; Doom Report, director of investment advising firm Marc Faber Ltd.</p><h2>Blackening Song: An Ella Clah Novel (Ella Clah, 1)</h2><p><p>Black<i>ening Song</i> is the debut of Navajo FBI agent Ella Clah, who returns to the reservation to investigate the murder of her father, a minister. The ritual nature of the killing makes Ella's brother, a medicine man, the prime suspect. Without cooperation from the tribe, the FBI, or the local police, Ella must plumb the depths of the struggle between traditionalist and modernist forces among the Navajo to find her father's murderer.</p></p><p><b>Aimï¿½e and David Thurlo</b> have won the <i>RT Book Reviews </i>Career Achievement Award for their romantic suspense, the Willa Cather Award for Contemporary Fiction, and the New Mexico Book Award.

He lives in Corrales, New Mexico, and often makes appearances at area bookstores.<p><strong>ONE</strong><br>Ella Clah sat alone in her booth in a northeast L.A. coffee shop. The laminated menu lay untouched near the end of the narrow table. She knew it by heart, having come here practically every afternoon for the past year. It was close to the Southwestern Museum, a place she visited frequently.<br>It was a little after five, too early for dinner, but she didn&#x2019;t feel like going home just yet. Today her bureau office had finally closed the fraud case they&#x2019;d been working on for the last six months. Most of the other agents were celebrating at The Watering Hole, a favorite bar just a short walk from their downtown L.A. office. Ella wondered if she&#x2019;d made a mistake by not going with them.<br>She had a reputation for being a loner, and, in truth, she rarely socialized with her fellow agents. It wasn&#x2019;t the company she minded; it was all the drinking. She&#x2019;d seen too much of it on the reservation where she&#x2019;d grown up. Though the sale of alcohol was prohibited on the Navajo Nation, alcoholism was widespread.<br>She stared at the red tile flooring, lost in thought. Her life on the Rez seemed like a century ago. In the last six years, she&#x2019;d moved four times. The bureau kept her on the move and away from her home in northwestern New Mexico. She&#x2019;d known about and welcomed the policy, which was meant to protect agents and their integrity, to keep agents far from investigations that might involve friends and family. The job-required travel helped Ella make a break with her past and start a new and different life.<br>Ella watched the oleander bush in the coffee shop&#x2019;s courtyard sway in the hot Santa Ana wind. Tempers were short when the weather was like this. She glanced around the room, silently noting the faces of the few patrons who sat in the booths and at the tiny oak tables. Only Jeremy Jackson, the manager, seemed unaffected by the seasonal breeze. Ella had known him for months and had yet to see him in a bad mood.<br>Jeremy was slowly working his way toward her booth. The tall, lanky, black man&#x2019;s easy stride matched his casual style. He stopped by every customer, greeting each as congenially as if they were old friends, making each feel special. He was good at his job. Business had doubled at the hole-in-the-wall coffee shop since he&#x2019;d taken it over.<br>Jeremy skirted the last few empty tables and slid into the seat across from Ella, flashing a wide grin.<br>&#x201c;Hey, Ella. Heard on the news the local FBI office broke open a big telephone fraud operation today. You in on that?&#x201d;<br>She nodded.<br>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;re you celebrating alone again, lady?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re here,&#x201c; she said, smiling.<br>&#x201c;Yeah, working, as usual.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d be happier if you had someone special. I know. That&#x2019;s why I keep getting married.&#x201d; He smiled.<br>&#x201c;Well, maybe five will be your lucky number,&#x201c; she answered, chuckling.<br>Jeremy glanced toward the entrance as the tiny bell above the door rang and a man walked into the shop. &#x201c;Damn. Not again. This guy getting to be a real pain.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Trouble?&#x201d; Her view of the newcomer was blocked by the cigarette machine near the entryway.<br>&#x201c;Nah, he&#x2019;s harmless, just a headache. He applied for a job about a month ago. I hired someone else, but he keeps coming back, trying to get me to change my mind.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He must really want the job.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s more than that. I get the idea he&#x2019;s racist as hell and didn&#x2019;t like getting turned down by a black man. I better go talk to him.&#x201d; Jeremy walked across the room.<br>Ella saw the man clearly as he stepped into the middle of the diner to meet Jeremy. The guy had brown hair, brown eyes, and was no more than average in height, almost painfully ordinary. Still, eight years of fieldwork for the bureau had honed Ella&#x2019;s instincts to a fine point. Something made her study him more carefully.<br>His short-sleeved white shirt and tan corduroy pants, though clean and neat, were threadbare. He was restless, shuffling from one sneakered foot to the other, as if the wait for Jeremy was unendurable. His nervous smile seemed to flicker on and off like a neon sign. As her gaze drifted down, she noted the zippered gym bag he was clutching in a white-knuckled grip.<br>Instincts weren&#x2019;t always on target, but without even thinking about it, Ella reached beneath her cotton blazer, feeling for her nine-millimeter Sig.<br>Then she saw the lines of tension around the man&#x2019;s face vanish as he spoke to Jeremy, and she breathed a sigh of relief. She was wound too tightly, that&#x2019;s all. Not everyone who looked nervous was a psycho in the making.<br>When she heard him laugh at something Jeremy said, Ella sat back to enjoy the hamburger platter the waitress had brought her. She was off duty, for pete&#x2019;s sake! It was time to stop acting and thinking like a federal cop.<br>She bit into a forkful of french fries seasoned with ketchup. Before she could swallow, the sharp crack of a gunshot sliced through the air and the glass mirror behind the cash register counter shattered into jagged slivers.<br>Ella peeked around the booth partition, simultaneously reaching for her gun. Staff and customers screamed as the creep fired wildly, shattering dishes and blasting food.<br>She blocked out the chaos, searching for a way to get off a clear shot and bring down the perpetrator. But the man had stepped back toward the entrance, and the row of booths blocked her view. All she could see was his hand and weapon. Looking low, between the chairs and the bottoms of tables, she saw Jeremy lying still on the tiled floor, blood pumping onto the terra-cotta tiles. The gunman&#x2019;s gym bag, unzipped, lay open, and Ella could see that it held spare magazines for his handgun.<br>He kept firing, each thunderous blast deafening in the confines of the shop. The madman had either a Taurus or Beretta nine-millimeter semiauto. He&#x2019;d fired off at least seven rounds; he had another seven or eight to go before he&#x2019;d need to reload.<br>Ella worked her way closer, trying to get clear of the customers who were huddled on the floor and using the tables for cover. One woman&#x2019;s piercing screams rose above the gunfire. <em>Shut up, lady. Don&#x2019;t give him a reason to take it out on you</em>! Ella scrambled forward, still unable to see more than the hand and the pistol, which bucked every time it fired.<br>Abruptly, the shooting stopped. The intense silence that followed was unnerving. As Ella angled around a customer, the man stepped into view. She raised her pistol, determined to make a kill shot.<br>&#x201c;Everyone against the counter,&#x201c; the gunman snapped, shifting position slightly. Now a metal post blocked her shot. &#x201c;If you do what I tell you, you&#x2019;ll live to tell the story. I&#x2019;m no murderer. All I want to do here today is make a point.&#x201d;<br>Before Ella could even take a breath, the gunman blasted two rounds through the table to his left; one round struck the waitress crouching there. &#x201c;I said get moving! <em>Now</em>!&#x201d;<br>Instead of complying, the terrified customers started screaming again. One woman tried to run to the door, but the shooter grabbed her arm, spun her around, and sent her crashing into a table. &#x201c;The counter! Can&#x2019;t anybody here understand English?&#x201d;<br>Ella heard sobbing from one of the two women huddled under the table in front of her. One started to obey the gunman, but the other yanked her back down.<br>&#x201c;None of you wants to die, and I don&#x2019;t want to kill you,&#x201c; the man said calmly. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s going to happen if you don&#x2019;t do exactly what I say.&#x201d;<br>His voice was so matter-of-fact it sent a chill right through Ella. Gut instinct assured her he was out to make one last stand. The only adversary more dangerous than a man willing to die was one eager to find death, and this guy was a little of both.<br>Ella stood, carefully keeping her gun out of his line of sight, but hoping to draw the man&#x2019;s attention. As she did, one of the women in front of her broke loose from her companion and rushed toward the kitchen doors. The gunman started to swing around just as the middle-aged Hispanic woman slipped on spilled food and fell flat.<br>Before he could squeeze off a shot, Ella lunged around the customer still between them, pushing the woman into the shelter of a booth, firing as she moved. Her bullet went high, and she only managed to catch the man in the shoulder, spinning him around.<br>Taking a slug from a nine-millimeter hollow-point was a bit like being kicked by a horse, yet the man recaptured his balance quickly. As he returned fire, Ella ducked out of sight behind a booth. His bullet splintered into the wall just to her right.<br>Oblivious to pain, the lunatic dragged a woman out from under a table. Hauling her to her feet, he held her in front of him like a shield.<br>&#x201c;Slide your gun over here, cop!&#x201d; he ordered. &#x201c;Then come out, or I&#x2019;ll blow her brains all over the floor.&#x201d;<br>The woman&#x2019;s terror was clear on her face, but only a tiny whimper came out of her mouth.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re out of time,&#x201c; he said calmly, raising his semi-auto to the woman&#x2019;s ear.<br>&#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; Ella shouted. She was as good as dead if she came out unarmed, but the hostage wouldn&#x2019;t have a prayer if she didn&#x2019;t. Ella took a deep breath and checked the .22-caliber backup pistol she kept in her boot. The tiny eleven-ounce weapon was only good for two shots, and she&#x2019;d have to reach it <em>fast</em>. A mouse at a cat convention had a better chance than she did.<br>&#x201c;Now!&#x201d; the gunman snapped.<br>Ella pulled the clip out of her pistol. She wasn&#x2019;t going to give him any more ammunition. &#x201c;Okay, relax. Here&#x2019;s my pistol,&#x201c; she said, sliding it across the floor toward him. &amp;ldqu...</p></p><h2>ULTIMATES 2 VOL. 2: ETERNITY WAR</h2><p>Secret Empire wreaks havoc on the Ultimates!

For the experienced spiritual aspirant, death ceases to be a source of fear or uncertainty, and instead is revealed to be what it truly is: a doorway, an integral part of existence, and an opportunity to elevate our consciousness. <br><br>The ancient teachings tell us that if we want to know what happens when we die, we must look to what happens when we sleep each night. When we die we enter the same world we dream within, but instead of returning to the deceased body we are propelled towards a new birth. If each night when we sleep we practice to enter the world of dreams with awareness, then when the moment of our death arrives we will be prepared to exit the body with awareness, and be capable of influencing what happens to us after death. That is the importance of astral projection: being awake in the dimension of dreams. <br><br>Samael Aun Weor wrote this book based on his own personal experiences of this process, while awakened in both the inferior and superior dimensions. Through anecdotes and by answering questions from students, he explains the recurrence of phenomena ï¿½&#x20ac;&#x201d; the mechanical repetition of behaviors, events, and circumstances ï¿½&#x20ac;&#x201d; that spin the wheel of nature around and around, which is the basis of our return into new bodies, and our repeated sufferings and problems. <br><br>In Beyond Death, you will learn about the process of preparing for your own death, while also learning about how to negotiate karma, understand ghosts, magic, reincarnation, the dimensions of existence, kabbalah, the role of kundalini (pentecost) in the disintegration of our defects, and ultimately, how to guide yourself towards a higher way of living, even beyond death.</p><p>Between 1950 and 1977 ï¿½&#x20ac;&#x201c; merely twenty-seven years ï¿½&#x20ac;&#x201c; Samael Aun Weor wrote over sixty books on the most difficult subjects in the world, such as consciousness, kabbalah, physics, tantra, meditation, etc., in which he deftly exposed the singular root of all knowledge. He experienced all the extremes that humanity could give him, from adoration to death threats, and in spite of the enormous popularity of his books and lectures, he renounced an income, refused recognitions, walked away from accolades, and turned away those who would follow him.</p><h2>From Prison to Purpose: A Journey to Answering Life&#39;s Greatest Question</h2><p><p>Steve Hopper is a good kid who loves football; and, as he grows up, so does his passion for the sport.

With the help of Gabriel Du Prï¿½, who&#x2019;s romantically involved with Chappie&#x2019;s mother, he locates him soon enough, disheveled and stinking of stale booze. But a sobering visit to a medicine man&#x2019;s sweat lodge reveals a much greater mystery: The unsolved case of a band of Mï¿½tis Indians who were last seen fleeing from Gen. Black Jack Pershing&#x2019;s troops in 1910, before disappearing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Strange voices within the sweat lodge speak of a place called Bitter Creek, where the Mï¿½tis encountered their fate.

When he was ten, Bowen&#x2019;s family moved to Bozeman, Montana, where a paper route introduced him to the grizzled old cowboys who frequented a bar called The Oaks. Listening to their stories, some of which stretched back to the 1870s, Bowen found inspiration for his later fiction.<br> &nbsp;<br> Following time at the University of Michigan and the University of Montana, he published his first novel, <i>Yellowstone Kelly</i>, in 1987.

Reprint. <i>AB. </i></p><p>This volume is a high-quality hardcover reprint of the novel previously published by Baen in mass-market paperback form.<i>Author's Note</i>:<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Vorkosigan Saga Reading Order Debate: The Chef Recommends</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Many pixels have been expended debating the 'best' order in which to read what have come to be known as the Vorkosigan Books, the Vorkosiverse, the Miles books, and other names, since I neglected to supply the series with a label myself.&nbsp; The debate now wrestles with some fourteen or so volumes and counting, and mainly revolves around publication order versus internal-chronological order.&nbsp; I favor internal chronological, with a few caveats.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have always resisted numbering my volumes; partly because, in the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because if I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately with <i>Captain Vorpatril's Alliance</i>) it would upwhack the numbering system.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the books and stories do have a chronological order, if not a strict one.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was always my intention to write each book as a stand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with that book that's in your hand <i>right now</i>, don't put it back on the shelf!&nbsp; While still somewhat true, as the series developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that were richer for each other.&nbsp; I will list the sub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Shards of Honor</i> and <i>Barrayar.</i>&nbsp; The first two books in the series proper, they detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral Vorkosigan of Barrayar.&nbsp; <i>Shards</i> was my very first novel ever; <i>Barrayar</i> was actually my eighth, but continues the tale the next day after the end of <i>Shards</i>.&nbsp; For readers who want to be sure of beginning at the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> and <i>The Vor Game</i> (with, perhaps, the novella "The Mountains of Mourning" tucked in between.)&nbsp; <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> introduces the character who became the series' linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the first book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by accident; the second how he fixed his mistakes from the first round. Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things one can best discover for oneself), <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> makes another good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male protagonist.<br> &nbsp;<br> After that: <i>Brothers in Arms</i> should be read before <i>Mirror Dance</i>, and both, ideally, before <i>Memory.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Komarr</i> makes another good alternate entry point for the series, picking up Miles's second career at its start.&nbsp; It should be read before <i>A Civil Campaign</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Borders of Infinity</i>, a collection of three of the five currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure sampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit themselves to length.&nbsp; (But it may make more sense if read after <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i>.)&nbsp; Take care not to confuse the collection-as-a-whole with its title story, "The Borders of Infinity".<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Falling Free</i> takes place 200 years earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with the main body of the series.&nbsp; Most readers recommend picking up this story later. It should likely be read before <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>, however, which revisits the "quaddies", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in Miles's time.<br> &nbsp;<br> The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear in italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words and 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Falling Free</i><br> <i>Shards of Honor</i><br> <i>Barrayar</i><br> <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i><br> "The Mountains of Mourning"<br> "Weatherman"<br> <i>The Vor Game</i><br> <i>Cetaganda</i><br> <i>Ethan of Athos</i><br> <i>Borders of Infinity</i><br> "Labyrinth"<br> "The Borders of Infinity" <br> <i>Brothers in Arms</i><br> <i>Mirror Dance</i><br> <i>Memory</i><br> <i>Komarr</i><br> <i>A Civil Campaign</i><br> "Winterfair Gifts"<br> <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i><br> <i>Captain Vorpatril's </i><i>Alliance</i><i>&nbsp; </i>(upcoming in late 2012)<br> <i>CryoBurn</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Caveats:<br> &nbsp;<br> The novella "Weatherman" is an out-take from the beginning of the novel <i>The Vor Game</i>.&nbsp; If you already have <i>The Vor Game</i>, you likely don't need this.<br> &nbsp;<br> The original 'novel' <i>Borders of Infinity</i> was a fix-up collection containing the three novellas "The Mountains of Mourning", "Labyrinth", and "The Borders of Infinity", together with a frame story to tie the pieces together. Again, beware duplication.&nbsp; The frame story does not stand alone, and generally is of interest only to completists.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Fantasy Novels</b><br> &nbsp;<br> My fantasy novels are a bit easier to order.&nbsp; Easiest of all is <i>The Spirit Ring</i>, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed books that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series.&nbsp; Next easiest are the four volumes of <i>The Sharing Knife</i>--in order, <i>Beguilement</i>, <i>Legacy</i>, <i>Passage</i>, and <i>Horizon</i>--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one continuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks.<br> &nbsp;<br> What have come to be called the Chalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written, like the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and can in theory be read in any order.&nbsp; (The third book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely connected first two.)&nbsp; Some readers think the world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in publication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the first (but not the third.)&nbsp; In any case, the publication order is:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Curse of Chalion</i><br> <i>Paladin of Souls</i><br> <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i><br><br> The short story collection <i>Proto Zoa</i> was an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three (1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but not in this handy format. The novelette "Dreamweaver's Dilemma" may be of interest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is the first story in which that proto-universe began, mentioning Beta Colony but before Barrayar was even thought of.<br> &nbsp;<br> My latest original e-edition is <i>Sidelines: Talks and Essays</i>, which is just what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of my nonfiction writings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions, and some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove an interesting companion piece to my fiction.<br> <br>Happy reading!<br> &nbsp;<br> -- Lois McMaster Bujold.</p><h2>Why North Is Up: Map Conventions and Where They Came From</h2><p>Many people have a love of maps. But what lies behind the process of map-making? How have cartographers through the centuries developed their craft and established a language of maps which helps them to better represent our world and help users to understand it?<br><br> This book tells the story of how widely accepted mapping conventions originated and evolved&#x2014;from map orientation, projections, typography, and scale, to the use of color, symbols, ways of representing relief, and the treatment of boundaries and place names. It charts the fascinating story of how conventions have changed in response to new technologies and ever-changing mapping requirements, how symbols can be a matter of life or death, why universal acceptance of conventions can be difficult to achieve, and how new mapping conventions are developing to meet the needs of modern cartography. <i>Why North is Up</i> offers an accessible and enlightening guide to the sometimes hidden techniques of map-making through the centuries.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Mick Ashworth</b> is director of Ashworth Maps and Interpretation Ltd and consultant editor to <i>The Times Atlas of the World</i>. He is also a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and a former president of the British Cartographic Society.<br> &nbsp;"Elegantly written and beautifully illustrated, <i>Why North is Up</i> tells you everything you need to know about the signs, symbols and science behind map-making. It will also reveal a few things you <i>didn&#x2019;t</i> know about maps. Essential reading for any map lover."<br> &nbsp; (Jerry Brotton, author of A History of the World in 12 Maps)<br><br>"In this&nbsp;handsome and informative book,&nbsp;Mick Ashworth picks through the conventions that have shaped cartography thus far, in a lively narrative augmented by lavish illustrations of the maps in question. For map addicts and casual bystanders alike, this is a terrific work that both entertains and enlightens."<br> &nbsp; (Mike Parker, author of Map Addict and Mapping the Roads)</p><h2>Portraits of America</h2><p>Whether exploring the reclusive communities of the Amish and Hutterites, probing the gritty existence of the American cowboy, or revealing the quiet beauty of the Minnesota lakes, William Albert Allard has helped define America in all its diversity. From rodeos to blues singers, from William Faulkner&#x2019;s Mississippi to minor league baseball, Allard has turned his camera toward parts of our heritage that are often overlooked. His other award-winning books include <i>The Vanishing Breed</i> and <i>A Time We Knew.</i><br><br><i>Portraits of America</i> features 165 of Allard&#x2019;s finest photographs. Presented in chronological order, with incisive introductions to each section written by Allard himself, these photographs show the creative development of a remarkably gifted artist.<br><br>Pulitzer Prizeï¿½winning author Richard Ford contributes a foreword that places Allard&#x2019;s photography within the context of the American experience. Art aficionados and lovers of Americana alike delight in this beautifully designed and thoughtful collection from a man who has become a legend in the world photographic community.</p><p>William Albert Allard was born in Minneapolis in 1937. Currently a staff photographer and writer for <i>National Geographic</i> magazine, he has contributed to over 25 magazine articles in his career. Allard has published four critically acclaimed books: <i>The Vanishing Breed</i>&#x2014;which received the Leica Medal of excellence and the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Award in 1982&#x2014;<i>The Photographic Essay, A Time We Knew,</i> and <i>Time at the Lake: A Minnesota Album.</i> He lives near Charlottesville, Virginia.In this career-spanning collection of photographs, National Geographic photojournalist Allard presents a beautiful cross-section of America over nearly 40 years. Beginning his career with photos of Amish life in Lancaster County, PA, he continues with pictures of the elusive Hutterites (a small Amish-like sect in Montana), life in the West, the highest and lowest classes in the Deep South, the lakes of Minnesota, and American rodeo culture. The high points of the photographic journey, however, are photo essays of minor league baseball and blues culture in Chicago, New Orleans, and Mississippi. Included are great character studies along with sweeping landscape shots and eye-catching photographs of people in action. This book is an outstanding look at life in American subcultures in the mid- to late 20th century and is recommended for all libraries.

Chris Chapman and A.J. Withers explore how normative social work history is structured in such a way that contemporary social workers can know many details about social work&#x2019;s violences, without ever imagining that they may also be complicit in these violences. Framings of social work history actively create present-day political and ethical irresponsibility, even among those who imagine themselves to be anti-oppressive, liberal, or radical.</p><br><p>The authors document many histories usually left out of social work discourse, including communities of Black social workers (who, among other things, never removed children from their homes involuntarily), the role of early social workers in advancing eugenics and mass confinement, and the resonant emergence of colonial education, psychiatry, and the penitentiary in the same decade. Ultimately, <i>A Violent History of Benevolence </i>aims to invite contemporary social workers and others to reflect on the complex nature of contemporary social work, and specifically on the present-day structural violences that social work enacts in the name of benevolence.</p></p><p><b>Chris Chapman</b> is an associate professor of Social Work at York University. <br> <b>A.J Withers</b> is a PhD candidate in the School of Social Work at York University, and an organizer with the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty. <br><p>"Linking history to the present is very important to social work readers. Discussing rehabilitation, assimilation, and repair, <i>A Violent History of Benevolence</i> acts as a counter-narrative to the more simplistic, history-as-progress narrative often assigned to conversations about social work. This information is vital for students and faculty, and the social work knowledge base."</p> (Donna Jeffery, School of Social Work, University of Victoria)<br><br><p>"The book beautifully and at times devastatingly traces the violent history of benevolence from which much current social work, and psy-expertise, has grown. This is a study of historical violence and atrocity that disrupts and makes unfamiliar continued and contemporary practices, making us look anew at how these practices enact violence, encouraging a deep ethical questioning of people&#x2019;s imagined rights to intervene in others&#x2019; lives." </p> (China Mills, Lecturer in Critical Educational Psychology, School of Education, University of Sheffield)<br><br><p>"Sensitive to how history is written, Chapman and Withers pull out threads that reveal what is not included in usual histories of social work." </p> (Sheila Neysmith, Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work, University of Toronto)</p><h2>On the Daltons&#39; Trail (Lucky Luke)</h2><p>Rin Tin Can, possibly the stupidest dog ever, is left in charge of the jail.

Some of those isles are uninhabited, while others are so small, they disappear at high tide. The infamous Barefoot Bandit hid out on San Juan Island. And I thought, who knows who else could be lurking in those woods? </p> <p>I live in a house in the forest on the Olympic Peninsula, so I know this misty, mysterious landscape. I know the way the wind feels on my face when I&#x2019;m out on the deck of the ferry, the quality of light, the species of wildlife that visit our garden. My home office overlooks a fir forest. Every time I glance up from my laptop computer, I see the setting of my novels! </p> <p><b>VHS: What was the most difficult part about writing a character with amnesia? What kind of research did you have to do for the book? </b></p> <p>AB: The most difficult part of writing from Kyra&#x2019;s point of view was climbing into her head and trying to understand her thoughts. I gathered her emotions &#x2013; fear, uncertainty, worry, hope &#x2013; and translated them onto the page as best I could. But I needed to make sure she didn&#x2019;t become shrill or irritating to the reader. She couldn&#x2019;t wallow in self-pity. She needed to keep trying to rebuild her life and her marriage, to keep seeking the truth of her past. </p> <p>For research, I read books on memory and types of memory loss &#x2013; and I studied books on marine biology, since Kyra is a marine biologist. </p> <p><b>VHS: Issues of trust, secrets, and questions about what you really know about the people you love are at the heart of both our books.

How does your book fit into that genre and does it play with any of those elements? </b></p> <p>AB: Readers should care about what happens to the protagonist, and the story should pose intriguing, pressing questions that drive the narrative through unexpected twists and turns and are not answered until the end. For example, in your wonderful book, EVELYN, AFTER, we know from nearly the beginning that Evelyn has secrets, about an accident, about an affair, but we don&#x2019;t know why, how, when or what the outcome of revealing these secrets will be. In THE TWILIGHT WIFE, I hope readers will wonder exactly what happened in the accident that stole Kyra&#x2019;s memory, and what key moments she needs to remember about the last four years of her life. </p> <p><b>VHS: My novel opens in the middle of an already troubled relationship that&#x2019;s about to get a whole lot worse&#x2014;something that I hope keeps readers wondering what will to happen next. Although THE TWILIGHT WIFE is a short read, you managed to pack a lot of action and tension into the plot. You really kept me guessing and I was totally invested in seeing Kyra get back to herself. Was there anything you edited out that didn&#x2019;t make it into the final draft? I need more secrets! </b></p> <p>AB: I love this question! I deleted or revised many scenes, and I wrote at least five different versions of the opening chapter. </p> <p>One opening began with this: </p> <p><i>My oxygen tank is running low.

Decades later, Mario Mieli&#x2019;s work continues to pose a radical challenge to today&#x2019;s mainstream queer theory and politics. First published in English in 1980, this groundbreaking book is now available in an updated and unabridged English translation, with a new introduction by Massimo Prearo and a foreword by Tim Dean.<br> &nbsp;<br> With extraordinary prescience, Mieli exposes how capitalism co-opts and markets &#x201c;perversions.&#x201d; In his view, the liberation of homosexual desire requires the emancipation of sexuality from both patriarchal sex roles and capital. Drawing heavily upon Marx and psychoanalysis to arrive at his highly original vision, <i>Towards a Gay Communism </i>continues to be essential reading for all who seek to understand the true meaning of sexual liberation under capitalism today.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Mario Mieli</b> was a leading figure in the Italian gay movement of the 1970s. <b>David Fernbach</b> studied at London School of Economics. He is the editor of a three-volume 2010 edition of Marx&#x2019;s <i>Political Writings</i> and author of <i>The Spiral Path: A Gay Contribution to Human Survival</i>.<br> &nbsp;"An indispensable, pioneering example of the long, difficult effort to articulate queer struggle with anti-capitalist struggle, and especially to understand the way in which sexuality can figure into the imagination of communism."&nbsp; (<i>Kevin Floyd, author of The Reification of Desire: Toward a Queer Marxism</i>)</p><h2>Zits: Sketchbook 1</h2><p>Fitting in.

Those who are living it can relate. And those who have been through it cannot remember the time without smiling, or at least wincing at the arrogance and ignorance we all mistook as maturity during those few eternal years.<br><br><i>Zits: Sketchbook #1</i> is an inside look at life from the point of view of Jeremy, a private 15-year-old who is desperately hacking his way out of childhood and into maturity. He labors in the shadow of Chad, his perfect older brother who is away at college. Jeremy is a freshman in high school whose main pastimes are hanging out with his best friend, Hector Garcia, forming a garage band, and being amazed at his parents' spectacular ignorance about almost everything. Impatient, self-absorbed, emotional, and bored silly, Jeremy is the essence of adolescence. <i>Zits</i> resonates with its fans because the strip contains so much truth and insight, wrapped in an uproarious context that's all too familiar to everyone who's been 15 or has parented a teenager.</p><p>Zits writer Jerry Scott also is co-creator of the award-winning strip <i>Baby Blues</i>.

Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs quickly take the case. Curiously, the killer has left behind a half-million dollars' worth of gems at the murder scene, a jewelry store on 47th street. As more crimes follow, it becomes clear that the killer's target is not gems, but engaged couples themselves. <br> The Promisor vows to take the lives of men and women during their most precious moments--midway through the purchase of an engagement ring, after a meeting with a wedding planner, trying on the perfect gown for a day that will never come. The Promisor arrives silently, armed with knife or gun, and a time of bliss is transformed, in an instant, to one of horror. <br> Soon the Promiser makes a dangerous mistake: leaving behind an innocent witness, Vimal Lahori, a talented young diamond cutter, who can help Rhyme and Sachs blow the lid off the case. They must track down Vimal before the killer can correct his fatal error. Then disaster strikes, threatening to tear apart the very fabric of the city--and providing the perfect cover for the killer to slip through the cracks. <br></p><p>Jeffery Deaver is the #1 international bestselling author of more than thirty novels, three collections of short stories, and a nonfiction law book.

Tracing the life of the eleventh-century military commander Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, called El Cid (from the Arabic Sayyidi, "My Lord"), this medieval epic describes a series of events surrounding his exile. The text of the poem survives in only one early-thirteenth-century manuscript copied by a single scribe, yet centuries later the figure of the Cid still was celebrated in the Spanish popular ballad tradition. Today almost every theme that characterizes Spanish literature-honor, justice, loyalty, treachery, and jealousy&#x2015;derives from the <em>Poem of the Cid.</em></p> <p>Restored by poet and medievalist George Economou, this elegant and spirited translation by Paul Blackburn is judged by many the finest English translation of a great medieval poem.</p></p><p><p><strong>Paul </strong><strong>Blackburn</strong> was among the foremost American poets and translators of the twentieth century.</p><br><br><p><strong>Luis Cortest</strong> is Professor of Modern Languages and Literature at the University of Oklahoma.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>Broken Skin (Logan McRae) (Book 3)</h2><p><p><strong>The third DS Logan McRae thriller in the No.1 bestselling crime series from Stuart MacBride. </strong></p><p><strong>A crime of passion ... or cold-hearted murder?</strong></p><p><strong>&#x2018;MacBride is a damned fine writer&#x2019; Peter James</strong></p><p><strong>The Granite City&#x2019;s seedy side is about to be exposed...</strong></p><p>A serial rapist is leaving a string of tortured women behind him, but while DS Logan McRae&#x2019;s girlfriend, PC Jackie &#x2018;Ball Breaker&#x2019; Watson, is out acting as bait, he&#x2019;s trying to identify a blood-drenched body dumped outside Accident and Emergency.</p><p>Logan&#x2019;s investigations suggest someone in the local bondage community has developed a taste for violent death, and he soon finds himself dragged into the twilight world of pornographers, sex-shops and S&amp;M.</p><p>Meanwhile, the prime suspect in the rape case turns out to be Aberdeen Football Club&#x2019;s star striker.

His only chance of&nbsp;escaping&nbsp;his&nbsp;current post&nbsp;is to get noticed. Not that any of the cases he&#x2019;s working on are the type that you want to get noticed for.<br>&nbsp;For starters, someone dumped a dying man outside the hospital. McRae&#x2019;s boss D.I. Roberta Steel and her team can&#x2019;t get an ID on the man, the person who dropped him off, or the car. McRae's second case is hardly any better. It involves a knife-wielding eight-year-old who is not only still at large but getting all kinds of sympathy in the newspapers. That kind of press does little for the department&#x2019;s accusations against Robert Macintyre, Aberdeen&#x2019;s star soccer player and another media darling. WPC Jackie Watson, McRae&#x2019;s girlfriend, is convinced Robert is a serial rapist, but they can&#x2019;t even hold him let alone charge him when the whole city thinks he&#x2019;s being framed. Catching these perps is thankless work, and even if he does, it seems like McRae&#x2019;s chances of getting off Steel&#x2019;s team are as bad as Aberdeen&#x2019;s without their leading goal scorer.<br>&nbsp;With his third masterful installment in a series that combines fast-paced suspense with a dark, distinctly Scottish sense of humor, Stuart MacBride has firmly established himself as a major crime-writing talent.Praise for <i>Dying Light</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Fans of Ian Rankin and Denise Mina will enjoy the mordant MacBride, whose second novel is every bit as dark and riveting as his debut, <i>Cold Granite</i>.&#x201d;<br>---<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Any of the flamboyant evildoers in <i>Dying Light </i>could carry a terrific whodunit.&#x201d;<br>---<i>Entertainment Weekly</i><br>Praise for <i>Cold Granite</i><br>&#x201c;Stuart MacBride joins an illustrious roster of Scottish crime writers. . . .

Someone has drawn pictures in all the steamy windows. These are poems about what composes us&#x2015;our names, our flesh, our vexed relationships to both&#x2015;and about ambivalence turned glittering and feral, about the question of what the body can and cannot stomach. Petrosino&#x2019;s language turns organs into verbs, and verbs into organs, metabolizing the strangeness of presence, regret, and hope.

She delights in unsettling the familiar with startling results, whether channeling Anne Sexton or William Blake. Her stylish innovation refashions traditional forms that insist on repetition. The poet signs her given name in a ghazal that also is an elegy for her namesake. She patterns a &#x2018;political&#x2019; sestina on a line that President Obama quotes from a sermon by M.L.K., who paraphrases Theodore Parker. In several unconventional villanelles, Petrosino abandons end-rhyme while keeping the double refrains and tenacious obsessions. Her chosen form admits recurring thoughts and dreams of conceiving a potential child: &#x2018;Your small breath troubles the flour / I&#x2019;m spilling. Did you leave sweet jam on the sill?&#x2019; The binding spell of Kiki Petrosino&#x2019;s Witch Wife conjures a good belly and a mouth not too pretty to sing.&#x201d; <br><br><b>&#x2015;Harryette Mullen</b><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s not a poet out there who amazes and delights me more than Kiki Petrosino. In Witch Wife, Petrosino&#x2019;s characteristic formal and syntactic daring becomes even more lush as she challenges both our way of hearing and making sense of our world. These poems of the body, of the ecstatic utterance that ends in grief, or glory, or the ghost&#x2019;s head turning toward us, seem to me to be an essential addition to this remarkable era of poetry we are in. Petrosino helps us see not just what we want, but what it means to want so many things at once. This is a necessary book in a time of great uncertainty.

Harder to detect, but no less real, is a Wright who fully understood, and suffered from, the choices he made. This is the Wright whom Paul Hendrickson reveals in this masterful biography: the Wright who was haunted by his father, about whom he told the greatest lie of his life. And this, we see, is the Wright of many other neglected aspects of his story: his close, and perhaps romantic, relationship with friend and early mentor Cecil Corwin; the eerie, unmistakable role of fires in his life; the connection between the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921 and the murder of his mistress, her two children, and four others at his beloved Wisconsin home by a black servant gone mad. In showing us Wright's facades along with their cracks, Hendrickson helps us form a fresh, deep, and more human understanding of the man. With prodigious research, unique vision, and his ability to make sense of a life in ways at once unexpected, poetic, and undeniably brilliant, he has given us the defining book on Wright.</p><p>PAUL HENDRICKSON is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> best seller and National Book Critics Circle Award finalist, <i>Hemingway's Boat: Everything He Loved in Life, and Lost,</i> and <i>Sons of Mississippi: A Story of Race and Its Legacy,</i> which won the 2003 National Book Critics Circle Award.

He is the father of two grown sons, both of whom work in media, and he lives with his wife, Cecilia, a retired nurse, in Washington, D.C., and outside Philadelphia.Chatper 1<br><br>The Enigma of Arrival<br><br>Mother-fueled, father-ghosted, here he comes now, nineteen years old, almost twenty, out of the long grasses of the Wisconsin prairie, a kid, a rube, a bumpkin by every estimation except his own, off a Chicago and North Western train at the Wells Street <br><br>Station on the north bank of the Chicago River, into the body heat of this great thing called Chicago, on a drizzly late winter or early spring evening in 1887. It is about six p.m. Supposedly he has never seen <br><br>electric arc lights before. Supposedly he has seven bucks in his pocket. (To get most of that, he has sold off, at old man Benjamin Perry&#x2019;s pawnshop on King Street in Madison, some of his departed father&#x2019;s library, including a calf-bound copy of Plutarch&#x2019;s Lives. He&#x2019;s also hocked a semi-ratty mink collar of his mother&#x2019;s that was detachable from her overcoat.) Supposedly he has managed his secret escape from his broken home on this mid-week afternoon without his two little sisters, who adore him, or his loving, divorced, and impecunious mother knowing. And now, with his pasteboard suitcase, and in his corn-pinching &#x201c;toothpick&#x201d; shoes, he&#x2019;s made it to what he&#x2019;s so long imagined as the Eternal City of the West.<br><br>He&#x2019;s just one part of this disembarking, suppertime crowd, these narrow tramping columns, anonymous thousands (well, hundreds), drifting out of the depot&#x2019;s great clock-towered front entry (after having checked his bag at the overnight luggage hold). He&#x2019;s turning south with them onto the Wells Street Bridge, which is a swing bridge directly <br><br>outside the front door, not quite knowing where he&#x2019;s headed, not willing to ask, just surfing along on this strange inland sea, possessed of his <br><br>own small reveries and desperations and unseen haunts, longing to make history on a large scale, propelled by a &#x201c;boundless faith grown strong in him. A faith in what? He could not have told you.&#x201d; So he will write, in the next century, on page 60, of his first version of An Autobiography.<br><br>The boundless belief is that he will somehow turn himself in short order into a world figure on architecture&#x2019;s stage. It&#x2019;s not only going to happen, but in not much more than a decade. Frank Lloyd Wright&#x2014;who will later wish to claim that he was seventeen, not nineteen, at this arrival moment; who wishes to profess to any would-be employer that he&#x2019;s finished three and a half years of college but has decided to skip his final several months before obtaining his degree because it was all bunkum anyway; who has an extraordinary gift for thinking in three dimensions&#x2014;has just stepped out into one of the great building laboratories of the globe. Stepped out into a rude, teeming, black-sooted, horse-carted, Bible-belted, prostitute-prowling, not exactly cosmopolitan and nowhere close to eternal metropolis that has been remaking itself since October 1871, when an apocalyptic fire, burning for thirty-six hours, took almost a third of its whole, something like 17,450 structures, practically down to weeds and the sands of Lake Michigan. Stepped out into a city that, in this decade alone, 1880 to 1890, has been doubling over on itself in population&#x2014;from half a million souls to more than a million. Chicago, which incorporated itself only fifty years ago, is now the most explosively growing place on earth. Because of the circumstances and geography of its location it has also become a world center of architectural innovation and experimentation, not to say a world center of transportation, on both land and water. (There are six major rail depots here&#x2014;no other American city has anything like it.) It&#x2019;s a horse-collared city whose tight downtown building core is hemmed in on three sides by a small river and a great lake: it must go up instead of out, at least inside the horse-collar. In the Lakeside City Directory there are 187 listings for architectural offices&#x2014;one-man ops to firms with rows of draftsmen and delineators. Some of these names are already entering American myth: Burnham &amp; Root, Holabird &amp; Roche, Adler &amp; Sullivan, William LeBaron Jenney. This small-town boy, with his large imagination, has struck Chicago, has hit architecture, the mother of all arts (so he believes), at its seeming ripest moment.<br><br>It&#x2019;s such a grand American story: the lowly arrival, the startling becoming, and practically every Frank Lloyd Wright book that&#x2019;s ever been written, not least his own, has wanted to deal with it in some way or other. Even accounting for all the luck and seized opportunity, no one has ever quite been able to explain how it happened, the realizing part, because artistic genius of this sort, or maybe any sort, doesn&#x2019;t have real explanation.<br><br>Except what if it didn&#x2019;t happen, not nearly, not even by half, in the way he himself later told it? Meaning: the arrival itself and the landing of the first job, but more than that, too. Wright chroniclers have pretty much known for years that so much of the arrival story and the first-job story, no matter how rich they are as stories, are, well, bunkum. Almost from the first sentences, the artist was once again giving himself away, leaving unwitting little breadcrumb clues as to some of his absurd falsehoods and myth-makings. I wish to try to take the bunkum a whole step further from what&#x2019;s been previously reported, but not just for the sake of doing it.<br><br>Never mind that now. Let&#x2019;s keep falling in step with him, pretending we believe it all, as he leaves the depot and turns right and crosses the bridge from the north bank into the city proper, gazing down at the &#x201c;mysterious dark of the river with dim masts, hulks, and funnels hung with lights half-smothered in gloom&#x2014;reflected in black beneath. I stopped to see, holding myself close against the iron rail to avoid the blind hurrying by.&#x201d; Three pages later, in An Autobiography: &#x201c;The gray, soiled river with its mists of steam and smoke, was the only beauty. That smelled to heaven.&#x201d;<br><br>Not that he knows, but he&#x2019;s arrived at a part of the city called Wolf Point, where the river&#x2019;s north branch joins with the south to make the main stem. During the day this is the busiest trade spot in Chicago. The Air Line Elevator, over his right shoulder as he&#x2019;s exiting the depot, holds 700,000 bushels of grain. By day Wolf Point is lumbermen and wharf-men and bargemen and cursing teamsters, but at this hour, the evening hour, it&#x2019;s turning back into what everybody knows as &#x201c;The Shadows.&#x201d; Wolf Point is emptying out, and he with it. Soon there will just be the forests of the tall-mast ships bobbing in the turgid stream&#x2014;and the stray, odd prostitute in a darkened doorway.<br><br>When you get across the bridge (it takes less than five minutes), you&#x2019;re at the junction of Fifth Avenue and South Water, where the wholesale grocers of the city do their cursing and trading; and if you were to turn west from there, and walk along the south bank, to where South Water Street unites with Lake Street, at Market, you&#x2019;d be at the site of the old Wigwam, where Abraham Lincoln got nominated in 1860. But he&#x2019;s going straight ahead, which is to say south, into the heart of the commercial business district. This century and some later, you can track the pilgrim&#x2019;s progress, squint and imagine him jaunting along, look down Loop alleyways and see the exposed brick sides of old nineteenth-century buildings, the ones he would have seen.<br><br>However, before he&#x2019;s across, while he&#x2019;s holding himself close against the rust-red iron railing, in the center of the span, above the green-gray soiled stream, peering down at its mysterious dark, trying not to get pitched over the side: look again at the photograph that begins this chapter. It&#x2019;s thought to be one of the first photographs taken of him after his arrival in Chicago&#x2014;maybe three months in. Don&#x2019;t be fooled, such finery is part of the mask, real and not real. And yet what utter seeming sense of himself, at least on the exterior, with that slight-tilted head, those just-flared nostrils, that purposed jaw. Did he rent the duds? What&#x2019;s that little pin or medallion edging from beneath his waistcoat? In any case, he has gotten himself down to Matthew J. Steffens&#x2019;s portrait studio on Twenty-Second Street&#x2014;it&#x2019;s one of the best in the city&#x2014;where maybe Commodore Steffens himself has disappeared under a black hood behind a large-format wooden bellows camera on a tripod to memorialize young Frank L. Wright onto a plate of ground glass. (A not incidental question: How did he pay for the session?) The portraitist may have printed his work on albumen and toned it with gold chloride crystals, bathing it in brown, the way Eugene Atget did, about a decade later, when he started catching, with his large-format view camera and its rectilinear lens (like this one), the hues of those perfect, empty, early-morning streets in Paris. I&#x2019;ll stretch things here a tad and say that the warming hues of this old first or second surviving photograph are the prefiguring hues of all those Wright interiors not yet born but somehow alive in him all the same. Even on the hottest day of summer, his interiors can make you pine for a crackling fire in a great brick or stone hearth. He made hearths the centerpiece of nearly every home he ever drew. They stood for probity, protection, family security, this from someone who once said, almost blithely: &#x201c;Is it a quality? Fatherhood? If so, I seemed born without it. And yet a building was a child. I have had the father-feeling, I am sure, when coming back, after a long time, to one of my buildings. That must be the true feeling of fatherhood? But I never had it for my children.&#x201d; (How did that make them feel?)<br><br>Okay, what remarkable sense of self, at least on the surface, but a telltale clue as to the mask part: he hasn&#x2019;t quite decided what to call himself or how to sign his name. Sometimes it is &#x201c;F. Wright.&#x201d; Sometimes it is &#x201c;F. L. Wright.&#x201d; Sometimes it is &#x201c;Frank L. Wright.&#x201d; And sometimes it is &#x201c;Frank Ll. Wright,&#x201d; with the double &#x201c;l&#x201d; (a cap and a lowercase) representing the name Lloyd, which is the common name of all his pious, maternal, clannish, prideful, Unitarian, Wisconsin-out-of-Wales people&#x2014;the &#x201c;God-Almighty Lloyd Joneses,&#x201d; as even they like to think of themselves, never mind their semi-disdainful farming neighbors. (It&#x2019;s the family&#x2019;s infernal ego and self-righteousness, principally.) But it&#x2019;s a supposed fact that he was born &#x201c;Frank Lincoln Wright,&#x201d; not &#x201c;Frank Lloyd Wright,&#x201d; and that his middle name was given to him by his now-spurned father. In any case, he&#x2019;s in the process of shifting his way of identifying himself, but he hasn&#x2019;t quite figured it out yet. (Sometimes he has been initialing himself &#x201c;FLlW.&#x201d;) The use of Lloyd in his professional life won&#x2019;t come for almost a decade. It&#x2019;ll happen as he&#x2019;s finishing the last set of drawings for one of his early and important transitional houses to his fully arrived Prairie Period. Then he&#x2019;ll be &#x201c;Frank Lloyd Wright&#x201d; for the ages.<br><br>A bell is clanging. People are starting to run. Oh, goodness, the provincial&#x2019;s been in Chicago ten minutes and he&#x2019;s getting &#x201c;bridged.&#x201d; The Wells, one of thirty-five bridges over the river, is swinging out. (The bridge sits on a pier, or piling, and a bridge-master in his little stall makes it pivot lengthwise, parallel to the shore, so that the tall ships can get through.) He locks his knees, holds on, rides it out, takes the swing, and damn if it isn&#x2019;t kind of fun. From An Autobiography: &#x201c;Later, I never crossed the river without being charmed by somber beauty.&#x201d; Moments like that tend to get sealed in muscle memory.<br><br>God, he&#x2019;s starved. Somewhere near Fifth and Randolph, which is five lines deep of horsecars, buggies, hansom cabs, every pedestrian for himself, the drivers larruping their nags with furious swearing, he ducks into a cheap eating joint and gives up seventy cents&#x2014;ten percent of his entire stake. Back out onto the street, the rain harder now, shivering, drifting south again, no idea where he&#x2019;ll stay tonight, turning east, coming down Washington Street: the monolith of the courthouse on his <br><br>left, the lights of an opera house on his right. It&#x2019;s the Chicago Opera House, magnificent palace, with its big canopy out front. Beneath the canopy, nearly life-size cutouts of dancers hold their painted colors against the gloom and the wet. He goes in. The booth man tells him the cheapest seats range from a quarter to a buck fifty. (He doesn&#x2019;t tell us this per se, but the prices are checkable in John J. Flinn&#x2019;s Standard Guide to Chicago, and it tracks with his narrative.) He parts with a dollar. The performance&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a ballet called Sieba&#x2014;won&#x2019;t start for an hour. Fine by him, he can dry out. He watches the place assemble. Say this, his deserter of a father gave him the lifelong gift of loving classical music. It&#x2019;s thrilling listening to an orchestra tune up. Even if this is sentimental music, it&#x2019;s orchestral music all the same. Suddenly he&#x2019;s sad. What must his sisters and his sainted mother back in Madison be thinking? His heart is aching for what he&#x2019;s done. But he wouldn&#x2019;t not have done it.<br><br>Back out onto the street, drifting with the crowd eastward again, to Wabash. He boards a cable car&#x2014;supposedly he&#x2019;s never been on a cable car&#x2014;and takes a seat up front by the grip-man, so he can understand how the thing works. But it&#x2019;s a short ride: the car is going to the barn for the night. Everybody off. He catches another car, headed back north, assaulted even more by the phantasmagoria of saloons and eateries and dry goods places, all with their signs and lurid lighting. This is the glorious Chicago? He gets a bed at the Briggs House, on Randolph and Fifth, not far from where he&#x2019;d started out about four hours ago. It&#x2019;s a good hotel, nothing like a flophouse. His bag&#x2019;s still at the depot, so he wraps a sheet around himself and surveys himself in the mirror. &#x201c;A human item&#x2014;insignificant but big with interior faith and a great hope.&#x201d; Tomorrow, he&#x2019;ll attack Chicago.<br><br>Which he does, finding a city directory, making a list of firms he&#x2019;ll call on. In his pocket, after the thinnest breakfast, the thin jangle of three silver dollars and a dime. It&#x2019;s a Thursday (he doesn&#x2019;t tell us this, but if you follow the logic of the narrative, it has to be), and the response is the same at every firm he steps into: no drafting work at present, young fellow, try us again down the road, won&#x2019;t you? Down the road? Don&#x2019;t they get it? &#x201c;University man, eh?&#x201d; a bigwig asks. Would that be Ann Arbor? &#x201c;No, University of Wisconsin.&#x201d; As he exits and enters offices, he&#x2019;s starting to sweat. His feet are killing him in these stupid toothpick lace-ups. Back in Madison, they&#x2019;d seemed so smart. But he&#x2019;s not above critiquing for his own amusement the architectural landmarks of the city. There&#x2019;s the Palmer House, supposedly one of the great palazzo hotels of the west. Looks &#x201c;like an ugly old, old man whose wrinkles were all in the wrong place.&#x201d; That night, again at the Briggs, he asks meekly for a cheaper room, and the clerk takes pity with a seventy-five-center nearly as good as the one he paid more than two bucks for last night. Earlier, supper was twenty cents at Kohlsaat&#x2019;s Bakery, on Clark, a spot he&#x2019;ll grow to love in all the Chicago years ahead.</p><h2>How the Marquess Was Won: Pennyroyal Green Series (Pennyroyal Green, 6)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Julie Anne Long reinvents the historical romance for modern readers, delivering intense, passionate characters and high adventure.

After school he was an engineering apprentice for seven years and was then unemployed for three years, during which he studied languages and how to start a revolution. While a teacher he began to write stories, plays, BBC scripts and stories, several of which won him scholarships and awards. After sixteen years of hill farming, Robert Roberts started to teach in prisons and became an acknowledged expert on adult illiteracy. Until his death, he was a well-known lecturer on this subject, both in universities and on the BBC. His other books are <i>Imprisoned Tongues</i> and <i>A Ragged Schooling</i>.</p><h2>Selected Poems</h2><p><p>Drawing from every stage of the Nobel laureate's career, Derek Walcott's <i>Selected Poems </i>brings together famous pieces from his early volumes, including "A Far Cry from Africa" and "A City's Death by Fire," with passages from the celebrated <i>Omeros</i> and selections from his latest major works, which extend his contributions to reenergizing the contemporary long poem. Here we find all of Walcott's essential themes, from grappling with the Caribbean's colonial legacy to his conflicted love of home and of Western literary tradition; from the wisdom-making pain of time and mortality to the strange wonder of love, the natural world, and what it means to be human. We see his lifelong labor at poetic crafts, his broadening of the possibilities of rhyme and meter, stanza forms, language, and metaphor. Edited and with an introduction by the Jamaican poet and critic Edward Baugh, this volume is a perfect representation of Walcott's breadth of work, spanning almost half a century.</p></p><p><b>Derek Walcott (1930-2017)</b> was born in St. Lucia, the West Indies, in 1930. His <i>Collected Poems: 1948-1984</i> was published in 1986, and his subsequent works include a book-length poem, <i>Omeros </i>(1990); a collection of verse, <i>The Bounty</i> (1997); and, in an edition illustrated with his own paintings, the long poem <i>Tiepolo's Hound</i> (2000). His numerous plays include <i>The Haitian Trilogy</i> (2001) and <i>Walker and The Ghost Dance</i> (2002). Walcott received the Queen's Medal for Poetry in 1988 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992.This career-spannning retrospective, culled from nearly 50 years of work, will go a long way toward reminding readers of the breadth and depth of Nobel laureate Walcott's achievement. Though he is perhaps best known for his modern epic, <i>Omeros</i>, which tells a Homeric tale set in St. Lucia, Walcott is a fine lyric poet as well, writing in traditional forms and meters as well as in powerful free verse. Alongside the epic tone that he brought into modern verse&#x2014;"I sing of Achille, Afolabe's son,/ who never ascended in an elevator"&#x2014;is lustful writing about a woman humming Bob Marley on a bus, a casual description of being mugged in Greenwich Village or a painter's-eye view of a fish. The political Walcott is also here; observing a crowd listening to a politician, he writes, "Who will name this silence/ respect? Those forced, hoarse hosannas/ awe?" The lyric Walcott is well represented, but the long poems&#x2014;which are necessarily excerpted&#x2014;prove more problematic. At best, the editor can hope that readers, hooked by one of these narrative poems, will be compelled to seek out the complete version. Nonetheless, this book represents a milestone in the career of a major writer. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Based on ethnographic research in this region where the mountains give way to the Gran Chaco lowlands, Gastï¿½n R. Gordillo shows how geographic space is inseparable from the material, historical, and affective ruptures embodied in debris. His exploration of the significance of rubble encompasses lost cities, derelict train stations, overgrown Jesuit missions and Spanish forts, stranded steamships, mass graves, and razed forests. Examining the effects of these and other forms of debris on the people living on nearby ranches and farms, and in towns, Gordillo emphasizes that for the rural poor, the rubble left in the wake of capitalist and imperialist endeavors is not romanticized ruin but the material manifestation of the violence and dislocation that created it.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Gastï¿½n R.

Gordillo shows us the haunted places where phantoms and curses join human bones and broken bricks: rubble. The Argentine Chaco becomes a magical landscape wrapped in multiple pasts and presents.

Gastï¿½n R.

Published in September 2005 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, LLC. All rights reserved.<br><b><i></i></b><b><i>Foreword: On Rereading</i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br><b>W</b>hen my son was eight, I read C. S. Lewis's <i>The Horse and His Boy</i> aloud to him. I had originally read it when I was eight myself, and although I'd reread the better-known Narnia books--<i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; the Magician's Nephew, The Silver Chair</i>--in the interim, more than forty years had passed since I'd read <i>The Horse and His Boy</i>.<br>Reading a favorite book to your child is one of the most pleasurable forms of rereading, provided the child's enthusiasm is equal to yours and thus gratifyingly validates your literary taste, your parental competence, and your own former self. Henry loved <i>The Horse and His Boy</i>, the tale of two children and two talking horses who gallop across an obstacle-fraught desert in hopes of averting the downfall of an imperiled kingdom that lies to the north. It's the most suspenseful of the Narnia books, and Henry, who was at that poignant age when parents are still welcome at bedtime but can glimpse their banishment on the horizon, begged me each night not to turn out the light just yet: how about another page, and then how about another paragraph, and then, come on, how about just one more <i>sentence</i>? There was only one problem with this idyllic picture. As I read the book to Henry, I was thinking to myself that C. S. Lewis, not to put too fine a point on it, was a racist and sexist pig.<br><br>I'd read two biographies of Lewis and knew that his relations with women, colored by the death of his mother when he was nine, were pretty peculiar. I'd read "The Shoddy Lands," a creepy misogynist fantasy in which the (male) narrator encounters a giantess whose nude body makes him gag. However, I remembered <i>The Horse and His Boy</i> only as a rollicking equestrian adventure, sort of like <i>Misty of Chincoteague</i> but with swordfights instead of Pony Penning Day. My jaw dropped when I realized that Aravis, its heroine, is acceptable to Lewis because she acts like a boy--she's interested in "bows and arrows and horses and dogs and swimming"--and even dresses like one, whereas the book's only girly girl, a devotee of "clothes and parties and gossip," is an object of contempt. Even more appalling was Lewis's treatment of the Calormenes, a brown-skinned people who wear turbans and carry scimitars. (Forty years ago, the crude near-homonym had slipped by me. This time around, I wondered briefly if Lewis was thinking only about climate--<i>calor</i> is Latin for "heat"--but decided that was unlikely. It's as if he'd named a Chinese character Mr. Yellow: it had to be on purpose.) The book's hero, Shasta, is the ward of a venial Calormene fisherman, but, as a visitor observes, "this boy is manifestly no son of yours, for your cheek is as dark as mine but the boy is fair and white." That's how we know he belongs to a noble northern race instead of an uncouth southern one. Of the Calormene capital--the seat of a fat, obnoxious, vulgarly bejeweled potentate called the Tisroc--Lewis remarks that "what you would chiefly have noticed if you had been there was the smells, which came from unwashed people, unwashed dogs, scent, garlic, onions, and the piles of refuse which lay everywhere."<br><br>It was difficult to read this kind of thing to Henry without comment: the words, after all, were coming to him in <i>my voice</i>. I held my tongue for the first hundred pages or so, but finally I blurted out, "Have you noticed that <i>The Horse and His Boy</i> isn't really fair to girls? And that all the bad guys have dark skin?"<br>Henry considered this seriously for a moment. "That's not true," he said. "The Tisroc is a bad guy, and C. S. Lewis doesn't say <i>he</i> has dark skin."<br>"Well, he's a Calormene, and all the Calormenes are dark. Of course"--I could hear myself start to fumble--"fifty years ago, when this book was written, lots of people had ideas that weren't true, about whether boys were better than girls, or whites were better than blacks, or--"<br>Henry shot me the sort of look he might have used had I dumped a pint of vinegar into a bowl of chocolate ice cream. And who could blame him? He didn't want to analyze, criticize, evaluate, or explicate the book. He didn't want to size it up or slow it down. He wanted exactly what I had wanted at eight: to find out if Shasta and Aravis would get to Archenland in time to warn King Lune that his castle was about to be attacked by evil Prince Rabadash and two hundred Calormene horsemen. "Mommy," he said fiercely, "can you just <i>read</i>?"<br>And there lay the essential differences between reading and rereading, acts that Henry and I were performing simultaneously. The former had more velocity; the latter had more depth. the former shut out the world in order to focus on the story; the latter dragged in the world in order to assess the story. The former was more fun; the latter was more cynical. But what was remarkable about the latter was that it <i>contained</i> the former: even while, as with the upper half of a set of bifocals, I saw the book through the complicating lens of adulthood, I also saw it through the memory of the first time I'd read it, when it had seemed as swift and pure as the Winding Arrow, the river that divides Calormen from Archenland.<br>Eight years ago, when I became editor of the literary quarterly The American Scholar, one of the first tasks I faced was how to organize the books department. Of course we needed to review recently published books, but how could we also honor the fact that for all true readers, the bonds that count are not with books we haven't yet met but with those we already know intimately? As the poet Austin Dobson observed in 1908, new books "have neither part nor lot in our past of retrospect and suggestion. Of what we were, of what we like or liked, they know nothing; and we--if that be possible--know even less of them." The solution was so obvious I wondered why every magazine didn't do it: we'd open our books section with an essay not on reading something new but on rereading something old.<br>And thus these Rereadings were born. In each issue of the Scholar, a distinguished writer chose a book (or a story or a poem or even, in one case, an album cover) that had made an indelible impression on him or her before the age of twenty-five and reread it at thirty or fifty or seventy. The object of the writer's affections might be famous or obscure; a venerated classic or a piece of beloved trash; a fairy tale read as a child, a novel read in the throes of first love, a reference work that guided the early stages of a career.<br>In short order the Rereadings became the most popular part of the magazine. Perhaps that it because they weren't conventional literary criticism; they were about relationships. The relationship between reader and book, like all relationships that matter, changes over time. A book that seemed a fount of wisdom to a fifteen-year-old might seem a trough of hogwash to a fifty-year-old; on the other hand, passages that were once dull or incomprehensible might be transformed by life experience from dross into gold. The Rereadings, as it turned out, revealed at least as much about the readers as about the books. Each was a miniature memoir at whose heart lay that most galvanic of topics, the evolving nature of love. Even if decades had passed, many of the writers remembered the color of the original book cover, the chair they'd sat in, the season, the time of day. Of course they did! Don't you remember the room in which you lay with your first lover, the way the bed faced, the color of the sheets, whether the pillows were soft or lumpy?<br>This book contains my seventeen favorite Rereadings: favorite not just because they're so good but because they're so dissimilar. Though all the writers are American, they live in five different countries; the books they write about represent eight nationalities. Their perspectives, their literary styles, and their senses of humor are as variegated as a patchwork quilt assembled partly from Balenciaga gowns, partly from torn blue jeans. But all of these essays pursue the same fugitive quarry--the nature of the reading--and, taken together, they have helped me understand why the reader who plucks a book from her shelf only once is as deprived as the listener who, after attending a single performance of a Beethoven symphony, never hears it again.<br></p><h2>The Psalms as Christian Lament</h2><p><i>The Psalms as Christian Lament</i>, a companion volume to <i>The Psalms as Christian Worship</i>, uniquely blends verse-by-verse commentary with a history of Psalms interpretation in the church from the time of the apostles to the present. Bruce Waltke, James Houston, and Erika Moore examine ten lament psalms, including six of the seven traditional penitential psalms, covering Psalms 5, 6, 7, 32, 38, 39, 44, 102, 130, and 143. The authors -- experts in the subject area -- skillfully establish the meaning of the Hebrew text through careful exegesis and trace the church's historical interpretation and use of these psalms, highlighting their deep spiritual significance to Christians through the ages.<br><br> Though C. S. Lewis called the "imprecatory" psalms "contemptible," Waltke, Houston, and Moore show that they too are profitable for sound doctrine and so for spiritual health, demonstrating that lament is an important aspect of the Christian life.</p><p>Bruce K. Waltke is Distinguished Professor of Old Testament at Knox Theological Seminary, Fort Lauderdale, and professor emeritus of biblical studies at Regent College, Vancouver.<br><br>James M. Houston is founding principal and former chancellor of Regent College and was the college's first professor of spiritual theology.<br><br>Erika Moore is professor of Old Testament and Hebrew at Trinity School for Ministry, Ambridge, Pennsylvania.<b><i>Stone-Campbell Journal</i></b><br> "Excellent resource for graduate students and pastors."<br><br><b><i>Review of Biblical Literature</i></b><br> "What is striking is that the authors draw out of each psalm unique pastoral and philosophical insights into lament, so that one might garner enough insights from this commentary to begin building a comprehensive biblical theology of lament. . . . Serves both academy and church well."<br><br><b>John Walton</b><br> &#x2014;Wheaton College<br> "The poignant lament psalms have often given voice to the confession and penitence of God's people through the centuries, but these psalms have also at times been a source of confusion. . . . Readers will find in this volume a treasure trove of wisdom from reliable scholars who know the obstacles inherent in the Hebrew text but also have long experience distilling biblical insights for the benefit of the church. . . . Drink deeply and find hope as you join with the psalmists in their intense interactions with God and their expressions of dependence on him."<br><br><b>Gordon Wenham</b><br> &#x2014;Trinity College Bristol<br> "Often neglected, the lament psalms are some of the most pastorally valuable parts of Scripture. This great commentary on ten of these psalms unpacks their riches by drawing on the interpretations of early Church Fathers and leading Reformers and coupling their insights with a detailed modern exegesis of the Hebrew text. Students of the psalms, preachers, and worship leaders will find this a splendid resource."<br><br><b>Tremper Longman III</b><br> &#x2014;Westmont College<br> "Too many Christians, including ministers, ignore the crucial spiritual resources of the lament psalms. As a result, the church does not know how to pray in the midst of suffering.&nbsp;<i>The Psalms as Christian Lament</i>&nbsp;helps rectify this lack by careful analysis of significant psalms read in the light of the interpretation of the early church. I highly recommend this book to all who love the psalms, but I hope ministers in particular will read this book and preach on the lament psalms to the benefit of the church."<br><br><b>J. I. Packer</b><br> &#x2014;Regent College<br> "In this volume Bruce Waltke, James Houston, and Erika Moore cover a selection of psalms that strikingly combine sadness and sorrow with faith and hope. . . . Masterful exegesis here blends with luminous theological perspectives and pastoral insights."<br><br><b>Haddon Robinson</b><br> &#x2014;Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary<br> "If you plan to preach on these hymns of hurt and confusion, this book is a good place to begin. Each psalm is translated in a helpful way, which is vital for preaching these psalms well."<br><br><b>Richard S. Hess</b><br> &#x2014;Denver Seminary<br> "Here is the finest of guides to laments in the book of Psalms. The authors recover a cogent interpretation of personal sin that forms the basis of the need for God's redemption. The cry of lament begins in the heart of the psalmist -- and of his readers &#x2014; and proceeds to express complete dependence on God. Journey on this ancient path of laments that bring us into God's presence as no other texts of Scripture do."<br><br><b><i>Books at a Glance</i></b><br> "A fascinating meeting ground between biblical commentary and Church history. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The amount of historical and biblical data alone certainly qualifies&nbsp;<i>PACL</i>&nbsp;as a go-to volume for anyone studying the interpretation of the select psalms.&nbsp;<i>PACL</i>&nbsp;also makes significant strides toward a Christian theology of lament by recovering for us the diverse, lamenting `Voice of the Church.' "<br><br><b><i>Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society</i></b><br> "<i>The Psalms as Christian Lament</i>&nbsp;admirably mixes history of interpretation with exegesis. Every interpreter is situated in place and time, and thus studying history of interpretation uncovers blind spots for modern interpreters. In addition to Houston's helpful history of interpretation sections, Waltke's and Moore's exegetical work helpfully describes and interprets the Hebrew Psalms. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This work will serve pastors who want to think critically about the text and how the text has been used through the centuries, as well as interested readers who want to understand the Psalms and their use of lament."<br><br><b><i>Haddington House Journal</i></b><br> "Old Testament scholar Bruce Waltke brings to the table over six decades of Hebrew exegetical expertise. Combined with James Houston's specialties of spiritual and historical theology, this distinctive commentary provides the best of current exegesis with the often-ignored voices of the Church's ancient heritage. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Serious expositors should consider adding The&nbsp;<i>Psalms as Christian Lament</i>&nbsp;to their collection, as it embodies the most up-to-date biblical scholarship by world-class specialists from an evangelical, devotional perspective."<br><br><b><i>Bible Today</i></b><br> "Uncovers the importance of the laments in the spirituality of contemporary Christians."<br><br><b><i>Expository Times</i></b><br> "Through its focus on the psalms of lament and the innovative approach to the topic of lamentation, this book is worthwhile for all those interested in the Book of Psalms, the value of early and modern lament to God, and what early and modern commentators think about all that."<br><br><b><i>Preaching</i></b><br> "One way we evidence our lack of immersion in the Psalms is our lack of familiarity with lament, our lack of practice in doing it well and in being comfortable with others lamenting. This book is a wonderful help in that direction. . . . This is a beautiful example of reading the Bible along with the church through the ages."<br><br><b><i>Mission Today</i></b><br> "As you read this commentary, you are likely to agree that the threesome have succeeded to an admirable degree in reinforcing our interest in lament psalms. . . . Readers will agree that it is a great aid to trustful prayer in times of pain and distress. The book will open your eyes to see that laments can to some extent reveal your very identity."<br><br><b><i>Euangelion</i></b><br> "<i>The Psalms as Christian Lament</i>&nbsp;is a valuable addition to the bookshelf of any pastor, preacher, or theological student."<br><br><b><i>Churchman</i></b><br> "This book is a treat."<br><br><b><i>Journal for the Evangelical Study of the Old Testament</i></b><br> "A welcome addition to the growing literature on the book of Psalms, particularly those focused on lament."<br><br><b><i>Spirit &amp; Life</i></b><br> "Bruce Waltke, James Houston, and Erika Moore examine ten lament psalms, including six of the seven traditional penitential psalms. Each chapter includes insights from the Fathers of the Church and other interpreters, the text of the psalm, a detailed exegesis, and a conclusion. . . . Although scholarly, the book is relatively easy to read and should prove helpful to many who pray the psalms."<br><br><b><i>Sharing the Practice</i></b><br> "A needed resource for ministers in guiding their congregations in learning how to voice honest prayers in times of suffering, pain, grief and death. . . . This volume is a readable and clear interpretation for ministers to follow."</p><h2>Picasso: Guitars 1912-1914</h2><p>Pablo Picasso's modest yet radical cardboard and sheet metal <i>Guitar</i> sculptures (1912 and 1914, respectively) bracket a truly incandescent period of structural, spatial and material experimentation for the artist. In October 1912, while in what he described as "the process of imagining a guitar," Picasso embraced the techniques of assemblage, collage, construction and mixed-media painting, frequently combining traditional artists' supplies--oil paint, charcoal, pastel, ink--with what were then unconventional materials, including cardboard, newspaper, wallpaper, sheet music and sand. Published in conjunction with an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, this volume situates Picasso's <i>Guitars</i> within the constellation of objects that surrounded them in his studio, affording a fresh understanding of the unique material and historical qualities of the artist's work in the years immediately prior to World War I. An essay by Anne Umland, Curator of Painting and Sculpture at the Museum, uses photographs, correspondence, archival records and eyewitness accounts, to explore Picasso's practice and the remarkable institutional history behind the acquisition of the two <i>Guitar</i> sculptures, both gifts to MoMA from the artist.</p><p></p><h2>Magritte&#39;s Marvelous Hat</h2><p><p>"Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see." &#x2014;Rene Magritte </p><p>D.B.

While the art reflects some of Magritte's own work, the text sets readers on a fun and accessible path to learning about the simpler concepts behind Mr. Magritte's work. </p><p>This delightful picture book captures the playfulness and the wonderment of surrealist art.

Mr. Johnson lives&nbsp;in New Hampshire.<br> www.henryhikes.comBelgian painter Renï¿½ Magritte, cast here as a dog, sees in a shop window a &#x201c;marvelous hat&#x201d; that appears to float above his head. He buys the hat, and it floats above his head wherever he goes. The two play games, traipsing in and around the streets of Paris, and the hat proves to be substantial artistic inspiration as well. Rather than trying to explain the surreal, Johnson captures its essence, blurring the line between perception and imagination. As Magritte and his hat have their fun, we see and experience the city through the painter&#x2019;s originative eyes. Johnson&#x2019;s crisp, polished illustrations, filled with nods to the artist&#x2019;s iconic imagery, celebrate Magritte&#x2019;s clear, almost upbeat absurdity. Four acetate inserts, printed on both sides to transfigure the pages before and after, enhance the curious sense of wonder. This jovial, peculiar outing is both an accessible introduction to the painter and a winning, nonsensical adventure in its own right. An author&#x2019;s note offers more information about Magritte, his work, and the surrealist movement.

Samantha and her half brother, Benjamin, survive, but she is left traumatized, her face horribly scarred.<br><br> Narrated in Benjamin's beguilingly plainspoken voice, <i>The Which Way Tree</i> is the story of Samantha's unshakeable resolve to stalk and kill the infamous panther, rumored across the Rio Grande to be a demon, and avenge her mother's death. In their quest she and Benjamin, now orphaned, enlist a charismatic Tejano outlaw and a haunted, compassionate preacher with an aging but relentless tracking dog. As the members of this unlikely posse hunt the panther, they are in turn pursued by a hapless but sadistic Confederate soldier with troubled family ties to the preacher and a score to settle.<br><br> In the tradition of the great pursuit narratives, <i>The Which Way Tree</i> is a breathtaking saga of one steadfast girl's revenge against an implacable and unknowable beast.

Benjamin Shreve, the teenage narrator of <i>The Which Way Tree,</i> unspools his tale of Civil War-era Texas in a voice that is utterly convincing, consistent, and believable. Crook never slips out of that voice for a moment. This is no small feat given that the tale involves Benjamin's demented half sister, the infamous massacre of Union-sympathizing German immigrants by local Confederates, and a giant panther. Any first-person voice involving a young Southern boy invites comparisons to Huck Finn. But dialects have complexities and Crook appears to be a master of them. Benjamin's voice swings between the rhythms of the Southern hills and the lofty, elevated tone encountered in Twain and contemporary Westerns . . .

For my younger self, especially, the shuffling, swamp-dwelling hulk was an icon of everything dinosaurs were supposed to be&#x2014;big, scaly, and, most of all, so thoroughly bizarre that they could only have belonged to a primeval past. And, though dead for over 150 million years, &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>&#x201d; lived on in my imagination. From the time I was a toddler, I desperately wanted to meet the gigantic herbivore. In my preschool scribblings, I included a pet &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>&#x201d; in crayoned portraits of my family. I kept it reasonable. I knew we could never afford an eighty-foot dinosaur, so I went with a Bronto roughly the size of a Great Dane. She was big enough to let me ride on her back, but small enough that my parents wouldn&#x2019;t go poor providing appropriate forage for my friend.<br>Resuscitating the dinosaur in Crayola colors barely even touched the depths of my dinomania. When my parents drove my siblings and me to Disney World for the first time, I so fiercely harried them about seeing the animatronic &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>,&#x201d; <i>Stegosaurus</i>, and kin at the Exxon-sponsored Universe of Energy attraction that Mom and Dad didn&#x2019;t even unpack the car before putting us on the right bus to see the dinosaurs. Forget Mickey and Minnie. The jerking, wailing robotic dinosaurs were at the top of my list. And while I would later curse being stuck in the mind-numbingly mundane confines of central New Jersey, my captivity in the suburban sprawl carried at least one advantage. There was scarcely a better place for a young dinosaur fan than the nearby American Museum of Natural History, just over the river in New York City. That&#x2019;s where I first met my favorite dinosaur.<br><br>The museum no longer looks like it did when my parents guided my younger self up to the fourth-floor dinosaur halls in 1988. Today, the white walls, high ceilings, and ample illumination make the skeletons of <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, <i>Edmontosaurus</i>, <i>Triceratops</i>, and other dinosaur celebrities stand out in sharp contrast from their surroundings. This open, airy vibe was created by a renovation project in the mid-1990s to adjust the prehistoric stars in accordance with new discoveries. Arranged in an evolutionary rank and file, the revised halls are a testament to how much dinosaurs have changed since nineteenth-century naturalists first recognized them. The AMNH dinosaurs stand alert, skeletal heads and tails at attention as if they&#x2019;re scanning a vanished landscape for food, friend, or foe.<br><br>During my early twenties, when I had the freedom to visit whenever I pleased, I took any chance I could get to wander among these skeletons and imagine flesh on their bones. And, as I strolled through those halls, the floors scuffed by the feet of so many youngsters on their first trips into the presence of dinosaurs, what I missed most was the dim, dusty Jurassic Dinosaur Hall that I encountered so many years before. The old dinosaurs were horribly wrong when I viewed them back in the 1980s&#x2014;awkward aberrations ultimately sent to the scientific trash heap&#x2014;but that doesn&#x2019;t diminish my memory of seeing them for the first time. Way back then, in the forbidding gloom of the hall, my imagination gave the bones a thin cast of vitality. The skeletons felt less like perished monuments to paleontology and more like bony scaffolding waiting to be connected by sinew and wrapped in scaly hides. My young mind didn&#x2019;t see dead dinosaurs, but the osteological architecture of creatures that might walk again.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>I was so consumed by the idea during my first trip to the AMNH that I can hardly remember my parents being there. Standing beneath the prehistoric skeletons, I was entranced. I couldn&#x2019;t take my eyes off the museum&#x2019;s &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>,&#x201d; with her neck stretched low, tipped with a moronic blunt skull full of spoon-shaped teeth. I was in the court of the queen of all sauropods&#x2014;the long-necked, heavy-bodied dinosaurs that were the largest creatures ever to walk the Earth. After all, as my schoolbooks told me, &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>&#x201d; was so massive that her name meant &#x201c;thunder lizard.&#x201d; When she walked, it must have sounded like a storm rolling across the Jurassic landscape. I imagined that sound as I admired her skeleton. She seemed poised to step off the platform, duck out the exit, and plod right down to the foliage along Central Park West. In the intense quiet of that moment, I could have sworn that I heard the ethereal remnant of the dinosaur&#x2019;s breathing. In a place with so many prehistoric bones, there had to be ghosts.<br><br>Yes, the old mounts of <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> and other dinosaurs were impressive, too. But they didn&#x2019;t stick with me quite like the &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder what it would have been like to catch a glimpse of the dinosaur trundling down my street, picking succulent leaves from the oaks of my neighbors&#x2019; lawns. I drew sluggish brontosaurs in my school art portfolios, made my plastic sauropod models bask in an improvised mud puddle I created in the driveway&#x2019;s storm drain, and dreamed of some far-off swamp where the dinosaur might still sun itself, enjoying a reprieve from extinction.<br>And then I heard the bad news.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>&#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>&#x201d; was dead to begin with. My favorite dinosaur wasn&#x2019;t real, but only a misconstrued amalgamation that had been borne and slaughtered by science. The dinosaur&#x2019;s true name was <i>Apatosaurus</i>&#x2014;a creature that paleontologists envisioned as vastly different from my brontosaur. <i>Apatosaurus</i> was not a waterlogged grubber of algae and water lilies, but in fact was a taut, active animal that trod Jurassic floodplains with its neck and extended whiplash tail held high off the ground. &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>&#x201d; as I knew the beast&#x2014;a hulking pile of flesh and bone that bathed in Jurassic swamps&#x2014;never actually existed. Almost everything about the monstrous creature&#x2014;its lifestyle, its skull, and, most regrettably, its name&#x2014;were human inventions drawn from prehistoric skeletons that actually supported a different form. I had been fooled! The dinosaur <i>I</i> met was a petrified museum zombie, shuffling on even though scientists had shot it down decades before.<br><br>You see, the dinosaur&#x2019;s major makeover wasn&#x2019;t easy, and it wasn&#x2019;t fast. I had encountered the brontosaur only as it was slowly fading from books and museum halls. A few years before I made my first museum visit, a groundswell of scientific interest in sauropods, stegosaurs, tyrannosaurs, and their varied kin&#x2014;given the dramatic title &#x201c;The Dinosaur Renaissance&#x201d;&#x2014;had crushed the image of dinosaurs as stupid, abominable reptiles and recast them as animals that had more in common with birds than with any lizard or crocodylian (a term for the group encompassing alligators, crocodiles, and gharials). The fossil bones were the same as they ever were, but paleontologists saw the petrified remnants in a new light. And in the special case of &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>,&#x201d; the dinosaur&#x2019;s name, skull shape, and cultural identity are all bound together in a complicated knot where science and imagination meet.<br><br>The story started over a century ago during one of the most fruitful times in the history of paleontological discovery. In 1877, the Yale paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh applied the name <i>Apatosaurus ajax</i> to the partial skeleton of a juvenile sauropod that Arthur Lakes, later one of Marsh&#x2019;s field assistants, had discovered in Colorado. Two years later, Marsh coined <i>Brontosaurus excelsus</i> on the basis of a more complete skeleton his men had found, this time at Como Bluff, Wyoming.<br>The dinosaurs were only subtly different, but in Marsh&#x2019;s day, paleontologists interpreted even the slightest of skeletal differences as indicators of previously unknown genera and species. After all, Marsh and his contemporaries were among the first to scientifically catalog a prehistoric lost world full of creatures no one had ever seen before. Who could say how many different forms there were?<br><br>In 1896, the paleontologist O. C. Marsh published this reconstruction of &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>&#x201d; <i>excelsus</i> in his major monograph <i>The Dinosaurs of North America</i>. (Image from Wikimedia Commons: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brontosaurus_skeleton_1880s.jpg)<br>In this case, though, what Marsh thought were two different dinosaur genera were merged into one. In 1903, the paleontologist Elmer Riggs argued that Marsh&#x2019;s &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>&#x201d; wasn&#x2019;t distinct enough from <i>Apatosaurus</i> to justify a new genus name. The &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>,&#x201d; Riggs reasoned, was only a new species of <i>Apatosaurus</i>, and since <i>Apatosaurus</i> was named first, it had priority of title. Thus &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>&#x201d; <i>excelsus</i> became <i>Apatosaurus excelsus</i>. The trouble was that the name change didn&#x2019;t filter from technical journals to pop culture (or, clearly, to museum displays). As institutions such as the AMNH erected <i>Apatosaurus</i> skeletons, they slapped the mounts with the old &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>&#x201d; label for reasons that have never been resolved. Maybe they thought the old name sounded better, or were unsure about rebranding one of the most famous dinosaurs in their halls. Whatever the reason, &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>&#x201d; was given a second life.<br><br>For the moment, let&#x2019;s follow the lead of Riggs&#x2019;s stubborn contemporaries and call the animal &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus.</i>&#x201d; In general form, the &#x201c;<i>Brontosaurus</i>&#x201d; skeletons museums so proudly displayed weren&#x2019;t very different from other huge sauropods, suc...</p><h2>Passionate Hearts: The Poetry of Sexual Love</h2><p>Compiled by renowned sex therapist and author Wendy Maltz, <i>Passionate Hearts</i> is a remarkable anthology of intimate, emotionally explicit, yet accessible poetry, representing new voices as well as the most revered contemporary poets.

For example, seven centuries before the discovery of penicillin, Russian herbalists were successfully treating infected wounds with mold. Herbalism is still practiced in Russia today but, unlike in the West, it has developed hand-in-hand with allopathic medicine. Russian doctors began to take a serious interest in the medicinal value of plants more than fifty years ago. Recognizing that herbs could be a potent and cost-efficient part of a modern medical practice, they began rigorous scientific studies to test herbs&#x2019; usefulness. Today nearly every Russian medical school offers courses on the study of herbs, and many maintain a special research department that investigates the practical applications of herbal medicine. <br> <br>Drawing on a wealth of oral and written traditions, <em>A Russian Herbal</em> explains the folkways, properties, and uses of the best-known Russian herbs--all widely available in North America, Europe, and Australia.

But it is also a call to a new fairness and equity between peoples, one that can restore autonomy to those cultures upon which our continued life on this planet may depend." &#x2014;Jean Houston, from the Foreword "This study of aboriginal indigenous thought should be read, studied, and pondered by anyone who cares about the civilization and culture of the conquerors, and about the possibilities of human existence, thought, and creative experience that have been marginalized and suppressed&#x2014;not to speak of the terrible fate of the victims themselves. It is a remarkable contribution." &#x2014;Noam Chomsky "Now is the time to set the records straight.

This short study by Stephen Westerholm carefully examines proposals on the subject by Krister Stendahl, E. P. Sanders, Heikki Raisanen, N. T. Wright, James D. G. Dunn, and Douglas A. Campbell. In doing so, Westerholm notes weaknesses in traditional understandings that have provoked the more recent proposals, but he also points out areas in which the latter fail to do justice to the apostle.<br><br>Readers of this book will gain not only a better grasp of the ongoing theological debate about justification but also a more nuanced overall understanding of Paul.</p><p>Professor of biblical studies at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.<b><i>Trinity Journal</i></b><br> "Westerholm's summary of the state of discussion is fair and incisive, and his engaging, easy style is a model of clarity and simplicity. . . . A fabulous volume."<br><br><b>Simon Gathercole</b><br> -- University of Cambridge<br> "Reading Stephen Westerholm's sketch of justification in Paul is a duty and a joy. This volume introduces the subject clearly and elegantly to students. But it also throws down the gauntlet to the New Perspectivists. How will they respond?"<br><br><b>John M. G. Barclay</b><br> -- Durham University<br> "Every student wrestling with 'justification' will be grateful for this highly engaging book. Westerholm nimbly develops the mainstream interpretation, while critiquing popular current alternatives (including those by Campbell and Wright). Here is ready ammunition for an important continuing debate."<br><br><b>R. Barry Matlock</b><br> -- University of Tennessee at Chattanooga<br> "Anything Stephen Westerholm writes on `justification by faith' is not just worth reading; it is essential reading. If you have been led to believe that Paul is only concerned with a Gentile problem, not a human problem; that 'justification' means 'belonging to the covenant'; that 'works of law' refers simply to 'boundary markers'; that 'justification theory' must be eliminated from Paul; then you have not been fully informed. And if being well informed on such things matters to you, then read this book."<br><br><b>Douglas J. Moo</b><br> -- Wheaton College<br> "<i>Justification Reconsidered</i>&nbsp;is a valuable summary and extension of Stephen Westerholm's fresh and compelling arguments about Paul and Judaism in his Perspectives Old and New on Paul. This book engages with key biblical and theological issues in current interpretation of Paul and is marked by a refreshingly clear and forthright style."<br><br><b><i>Theology Today</i></b><br> "Oldness does not necessarily mean obsolescence. A reading of&nbsp;<i>Justification Reconsidered</i>&nbsp;confirms that and gives the reader a succinct introduction to the issues involved when Pauline revisionists maintain otherwise."<br><br><b><i>Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society</i></b><br> "What I love most about Stephen Westerholm is his ability to articulate and celebrate the freshness of the old perspective on Paul. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I cannot more highly recommend Westerholm's new book to anyone who has an interest in Paul. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A must read for all seekers of Paul. It is short. It is to the point. It interacts with some key Pauline scholars. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Most importantly, it confidently and clearly shows that a traditional reading of Paul, although it may need a tune-up, is in no way in need of a complete overhaul."<br><br><b><i>Reviews in Religion</i></b><br> "A wonderfully written analysis of the key issues in the debate. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Could work well as an introduction to justification in Paul for an undergraduate course, or for students at whatever level seeking a summary of recent writings on this theme. It would also be a stimulating read for those enamored with `new perspectives' on Paul, encouraging them to look again at a `traditional approach' to Paul's justification language. In my view, they could hardly find a better guide than Westerholm."<br><br><b><i>Lutheran Quarterly</i></b><br> "It can be recommended as a primer for the general reader on current debates, and it should be considered as a serious challenge to academic interpreters."<br><br><b><i>Reformation 21</i>&nbsp;(blog)</b><br> "Read this short, engaging book. An evangelical reader will get up to speed on various critical views of Paul concerning justification and enjoy a heart-warming defense of the glorious Gospel."<br><br><b><i>Theological Book Review</i></b><br> "An interesting and engaging interaction on the topic of justification."<br><br><b><i>Review of Biblical Literature</i></b><br> "Concise and lucid. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

The fast-paced swashbuckling will surely satisfy fans of adventure, but it's really Egg's narration that makes this pirate story rise above its counterparts. Wittily observant and self-deprecating, Egg relays the series of absurd events that precede his escape from Deadweather with a fair amount of humor, while his decision to avenge the deaths of his family&#x2014;despite their mistreatment of him&#x2014;lends the tale a certain nobility.&#x201d;<br>FROM&nbsp;<i>THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE</i>:<br>&#x201c;What a wonderful hybrid plot: islands, buried treasure, a lad avenging violence against his family, sea voyages, tourist cruises, real pirates, fake pirates for the tourist trade, and leftover pirates, too maimed for sea work. . . .

Mention the number anywhere near a ballpark and before you can ask who or what, fans will almost certainly shape their lips with a single word: Wilson. They ll tell you Hack Wilson, a burly, bull-necked outfielder who roamed Wrigley Field in the 1920s and 1930s, was the man who drove in 191 runs in 1930 more than most players had hits. A few of them will know that in 1929, Wilson racked up 159 RBI and hit 39 home runs. Still fewer might be able to tell you that for the four seasons 1927 1930, the slugger hit no fewer than 30 home runs a season and drove home no fewer than 120. But you are unlikely to find more than a handful of fans who know how the Cub great&#39;s career came to an end. Or when. Or why. The heir apparent to Ruth s title of world-beater, Wilson was a star by his late 20s and a record setter by 30. But he was also an alcoholic who was as practiced at swinging his fists as he was his bat. By his early 30s his days as a full-time player were behind him, and by 48 he was dead; his son refused to claim the body. This biography examines the turbulent life and career of one of the most dominant short-stint powerhitters ever to pull on a uniform. From Wilson s early career as a steelworker, through his time as the beloved ballplayer and icon for the City of Big Shoulders to his days as a down-on-his-luck baseball washout and itinerant laborer, an unflinching look at this Hall of Famer is provided.</p><p><b>Clifton Blue Parker</b> has had his work appear in <i>The New York Times, The Washington Post,</i> and <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i> A member of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), he lives in Woodland, California and is also the author of McFarland s <i>Big and Little Poison: Paul and Lloyd Waner, Baseball Brothers</i> (2003).Hack Wilson drove in 191 runs for the Chicago Cubs in 1930, a record that may never be broken. Yet four years later, at age 34, his major-league career was over. Squat by today's standards, Wilson, who grew up wielding a sledgehammer in the Pennsylvania steel mills, was surprisingly speedy and strong enough to knock in more than 100 runs in five consecutive years. But he was a heavy drinker and a free spender--a perfect match for freewheeling Prohibition Chicago. Booze took its toll, and when Wilson died penniless in 1948, his son refused to claim the body. Parker recounts Wilson's rags-to-riches-to-rags life in carefully researched detail, noting that, by the standards of the day, Wilson's behavior was perfectly appropriate: ballplayers were expected to drink as hard as they played. Wilson, a star who burned brightly but too briefly, is usually overlooked when the great ones are discussed. Parker's informative and insightful biography may not change public opinion, but it helps to set the record straight. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

It&#x2019;s a fluidly written, fascinating book about Michael Mewshaw and Pat Conroy caught in the crossbeams of past and present, fated to overlap, bond, retreat, and then&#x2015;as Mewshaw clearly hopes&#x2015;to unite in a different configuration a final time.&#x201d; &#x2015;Ann Beattie, author of <i>The Accomplished Guest</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Sympathy for the Devil</i></b><br><br> "Michael Mewshaw's <i>Sympathy for the Devil</i>, his reminiscence of Gore Vidal, proves easy to praise&#x2015;swift, canny, sensitive, and unafraid." &#x2015;John Domini, <i>Bookforum</i><br><br> "[Mewshaw's] Vidal is brilliantly alive, raunchy, as easily offended as he is quick to give offense&#x2015;and then, finally, desperately self-hating, vituperative, and alone." &#x2015;Julia M. Klein, <i>The Boston Globe</i> <br><br> "Exceptionally entertaining." &#x2015;Michael Dirda, <i>The Washington Post</i><br><br> "Mewshaw develops a picture of his friend as quixotic, a devoted life-mate to his companion Howard Austin, an avuncular if not fatherly figure and often a raging provocateur at dinner parties, banquets and conferences-except when he's not. Mewshaw records a lot of sharp, witty one-liners which, as he reveals, Vidal practiced and polished before he delivered them. And the vast amounts of alcohol the writer imbibed on a daily basis reveal him to be a contradictory character . . . A study of friendship with a famous man, easy to admire and difficult to love." &#x2015;Alan Cheuse, <i>NPR, All Things Considered</i><br><br> "Fascinating . . . <i>Sympathy for the Devil</i> might be the perfect Vidal biography because it reveals a figure that is more human&#x2015;more flawed, more interesting, more real&#x2015;than the caricature that the public came to accept as the bona fide Gore." &#x2015;Doug Childers, <i>Richmond Times</i><br><br> "Michael Mewshaw knew Vidal as a friend for nearly forty years, and he pays his respects to him in this affectionate, sympathetic biography. [<i>Sympathy for the Devil</i> is] a thoroughly entertaining, breezy and up-close memoir about a public man of 'wealth and taste' who prided himself on his pride." &#x2015;Tom Lavoie, <i>Shelf Awareness</i><br><br> "In <i>Sympathy for the Devil</i>, Michael Mewshaw removes the mask to reveal a man much more complex and tortured than most fans of Vidal's writings might ever have dared imagine . . . The decline and fall of Gore Vidal is a painful but perversely exciting read. Behind the patrician veneer was clearly a troubled man." &#x2015;Robert Collison, <i>The Toronto Star</i><br><br> "A companionable account that finally succeeds in living up to its title. The reader, too, will feel sympathy for the old devil . . . there is little doubt that Mewshaw's affection for Vidal is genuine." &#x2015;James Campbell, <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br> "[A] fun read." &#x2015;<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br> "To Mewshaw's credit, readers will share his sadness as he watches his dear friend, the oft-irascible, even unlikable Vidal, decline." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> "Built of anecdote and gossip, <i>Sympathy for the Devil</i> proffers entertainment rather than heft. It makes a good read for a sunny day on the beach, a rainy day in the house, or a long flight." &#x2015;<i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i><br><br>"Mewshaw's account is more devilish (and sometimes downright cruel) than sympathetic, but it's also well-written, funny and never boring. Literary lives don't get dishier." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i><br><br> "In <i>Sympathy for the Devil: Four Decades of Friendship with Gore Vidal</i> (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) author Michael Mewshaw reveals an individual as gorgeous as any of Vidal's historical or fictional characters. His portrayal of Vidal is not a bouquet, yet it does reflect the love of a friendship lasting four decades. Mewshaw was in awe of the master, but he was not taken in by him." &#x2015;<i>Lambda Literary</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Between Terror and Tourism</i></b><br><br> "At last, somebody's come to grips with North Africa, and the good news is that that somebody is Michael Mewshaw, the veteran novelist and travel writer. His droll, plucky, hands-on trek from the Suez to the souks of Tangier, a region marked by doubtful democracies, Islamic fundamentalism and colorful characters, leaves us far wiser&#x2015;not to mention superbly entertained. Mewshaw's fascinating, never-dull book should be required reading for the State Department and, better yet, for the Pentagon." &#x2015;Theodore Stanger, former <i>Newsweek</i> Bureau Chief in Jerusalem and Paris<br><br> "In a part of the world where the perils of sand and sunburn really do compete with the danger of bullets and bombs, Michael Mewshaw travels with humor, insight and a sense of history. Don't miss this trip!" &#x2015;Richard Roth, <i>CNN</i> correspondent<br><br> "Michael Mewshaw takes the reader on a journey most can only dream of. He scares, thrills and informs on his gritty tale of solo travel through a region little understood by the outside world. His hilarious accounts of his quixotic experiences underplay the dangers he faces. If you want to feel the warmth of the Mediterranean sun, the chill of north African rain, and the bumps in the road this is the book to read. Mewshaw is one of the finest travel writers of our time." &#x2015;Nic Robertson, Senior International Correspondent at <i>CNN</i><br><br> "This is the story of a journey through a part of the world both unknown and relevant to most Americans. It is an enlightening and very entertaining book." &#x2015;Tracy Kidder, author of <i>Mountains Beyond Mountains</i><br><br>"Seasoned travelers will sympathize with the cultural misunderstandings and bureaucratic troubles encountered in various places, particularly Libya. Mewshaw admits that 'travel is a need as urgent as oxygen.' That urgency is evident in each well-turned phrase and incisive observation." &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br> "Mewshaw wonderfully engages the travel reader's vicarious demand for history, cultural insight, and unexpected incident." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>If You Could See Me Now</i></b><br><br> "[A] real bond grew between the adopted child and the man who was not her father but who became her friend. Mewshaw helped Amy patiently and compassionately in spite of his hurts and shortcomings, just as he once helped her mother. There is courage in this exercise, and there is hope. Supported by loving families in the present, these two people went looking for an uncomfortable piece of the past together. Now that they have found it, maybe they both can leave it behind." &#x2015;<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br> "<i>If You Could See Me Now</i> is a work of art and stands shoulder to shoulder with the best memoirs of our age. Mewshaw's career is a pure wonder and <i>If You Could See Me Now</i> is his crowning achievement." &#x2015;Pat Conroy, author of <i>The Death of Santini</i> and <i>The Prince of Tides</i><br><br> "Mewshaw's considerable skill as writer lends heart and spirit to his bittersweet chronicle . . . Mewshaw shares his memories poignantly and honestly . . . The results are powerful, indeed." &#x2015;<i>Midwest Book Review</i><br><br> "[P]oignant . . . What makes the narrative distinctive is that the storyteller is not a part of the adoption triad (birthparent, adopting parent, and adoptee), yet it still illustrates the difficulties that adoptees face in researching their biological background and in locating birth parents who had been assured of anonymity . . . Although true, this story reads like fiction and is hard to put down once started. An excellent addition to all public libraries; highly recommended." &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Playing Away</i></b><br><br> "Mewshaw presents portraits of well-known writers (Graham Greene and Gore Vidal, for example) who have chosen to make their homes in other than their native countries. While somewhat lacking in focus, this is an energetic and intelligent work." &#x2013;&#x2013;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br></p><h2>Argentine Mauser Rifles: 1871-1959 (Schiffer Military History Book)</h2><p>This is the complete story of Argentina&#39;s contract Mauser rifles from the purchase of their first Model 1871s to the disposal of the last shipment of surplus rifles received in the United States in May 2002. Between 1891-1959 Argentina bought or manufactured nearly 500,000 Mauser rifles and carbines for itself as well as for its neighbors Peru, Bolivia, Uruguay and Paraguay. It also supplied Spain with rifles to help suppress the Melilla revolt in Morocco, which were eventually used against the United States during the Spanish American War of 1898. The Argentine Commission&#39;s relentless pursuit of tactical superiority resulted in a major contribution to the development of Mauser&#39;s now famous bolt-action system. The combined efforts of the Belgian, Turkish and Argentine arms commissions between 1889 and 1892 produced the origins of what became the Model 98 bolt-action system that is still in use today over 110 years later. Details include: thirty-seven identified variants; the history behind each purchase and the technical description of each variant; contract-by-contract, and in the case of the Model 1891, 1909 and 1947 weapons a month-by-month, detail of production and shipping data; over 400 pictures, illustrations, documents and blueprints; history and details of the manufacturing facilities in Europe and in Argentina as well as a description of the manufacturing process used by the &#34;Matheu&#34; (DGFM-FMAP) small arms factory in Argentina; interesting and colorful anecdotes about the people involved, including revelations about spying and secret alliances never before revealed.</p><p>Colin Webster is professor of criminology at Leeds Metropolitan University.</p><h2>Bond of Secrecy: My Life with CIA Spy and Watergate Conspirator E.

Each of the three novels gathered here vividly and unforgettably conjures up an entire world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Booker Prize-winning novel <i>Offshore </i>limns the marginal existence of an eccentric assortment of barge dwellers on the Thames in the early 1960s, a group of misfits who are drawn to life on the muddy river in exile from the world of the landlocked. <i>Human Voices</i> takes us behind the scenes at the BBC during World War II, as world-weary directors and nubile young assistants attempt to save Britain&#x2019;s heritage and keep Britons calm in the face of a feared German invasion. In <i>The Beginning of Spring</i>, a struggling English printer living in Moscow in 1913 is abandoned by his wife and left alone to care for his three young children in the face of the impending revolution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fitzgerald is a genius of the relevant detail and the deftly sketched context, and these narrative gems are marvels of compassion, wit, and piercing insight.</p></p><p>Penelope Fitzgerald (1916-2000) emerged late in life as one of the most remarkable English writers of the last century. She began her writing career in 1975 at the age of fifty-nine, and over the next two decades she published three biographies, nine novels, and a collection of short stories.It is rare indeed to begin a literary career after the age of sixty, and then to achieve reputation and fame as a novelist during the next decade. But Penelope Fitzgerald was a highly unusual and original sort of writer. Before she turned to writing she had married and raised a family, worked during the war at the BBC (the setting of her fourth novel, <i>Human Voices</i>), run a bookshop (an experience that also provided a novel), and taught school, including a school for theatre and drama training.<br> <br>Her first book was a study of the Victorian artist Edward Burne-Jones. She followed this with <i>The Knox Brothers</i>, a biography of her father Edmund Knox, the gifted and remarkable editor of <i>Punch, </i>and her equally talented set of uncles. That might well have been enough for most writers at her age, but it turned out to be in the nature of a prologue to her real career as a novelist.<br><br>In a cool modest way Fitzgerald was an experimenter, never repeating the same kind of novel twice. Her first, <i>The Golden Child</i>, plays engagingly with the forms of the mystery and detective story, but its real charm lies in the field of comedy: in this case the quirks and personalities of the staff who run the big museum which is housing a prize exhibit. This was followed by the lively and delightful story of <i>The Bookshop</i>, the prelude, as it might be said, to <i>Offshore</i>, her first assured masterpiece, nouvelle and almost miniature as in a sense it is. All her books have the quality, and the impact, that goes with a particular sort of brevity: their simplicity and their author&#x2019;s finely individual line of vision, unique in each particular case, makes them seem longer than they really are.<br><br><i>Offshore</i>, which won the prestigious Booker Prize, to the surprise of some of the judges, and, indeed, to the amazement if not the chagrin of other, more heavyweight contenders, has a deceptive simplicity about it. It needs to be read at least twice before the reader grasps how subtle and how eventually rewarding are its method and effect.<br><br>As with Penelope Fitzgerald&#x2019;s other novels, a close analogy suggests itself with what happens to us when we meet new aquaintances in ordinary daily life. In such a situation we may soon realize that we know very little: our first impressions (to borrow the original title of Jane Austen&#x2019;s first novel) are probably not true, or even just, but in life itself we hardly have the opportunity, and seldom indeed the inclination, to enquire or to wonder much further. We are in that situation as we continue to encounter Nenna, the wife whose husband has left her, and who &#x2014; in a muddled way, distracted as she is by everyday cares and problems &#x2014; wishes he hadn&#x2019;t. The wholly disconcerting effect that the young can have, even &#x2014; or perhaps indeed especially &#x2014; on their parents, is suggested by a sentence about them so quietly laconic and unobtrusive that it seems almost absent-minded: &#x2018;The crucial moment when children realise that their parents are younger than they are had long since been passed by Martha.&#x2019;<br><br>Martha and her sister Tilda are, in their unflamboyant way, a disconcerting pair, but readers have, as it were, too much to do with other people and other matters, with the boats and the personalities of their owners, with the absorbing nature of the odd and yet perfectly normal world they find themselves in, to worry much about the nature of the children. They are so obviously not worried themselves: and very little attention is paid to them by anybody. As their creator so economically remarks &#x2014; and the uninsistent humour of the moment is typical of all Penelope Fitzgerald&#x2019;s fiction &#x2014; children do indeed discover, or at least receive the impression, that &#x2014; in the words of a wise old priest &#x2014; there are no true adults in the world, and that they themselves are as old as they are ever likely to be. There is a kind of insecurity about the Fitzgerald world which makes it, as every page turns, so increasingly fascinating and challenging. She never attempts to analyse or to possess her characters in the way, for instance, that Henry James, another master of the nouvelle form, finds it too strong a temptation not to do. <br><br>And this odd fact may indeed give the clue to the way in which readers finds themselves hooked. Some mystery, some secret will surely emerge; and yet it does not. Her readers are no wiser about what the people they have been reading about are like at the end of the novel than they were at the beginning. <i>That </i>is not, as it were, the point of the exercise, as it would be, say, in a nouvelle by Henry James or a novel by George Eliot. <br><br>The same applies to story or plot. Penelope Fitzgerald&#x2019;s novels don&#x2019;t have plots, but they give a wonderful illusion of having them, by keeping the reader glued to the page, in anticipation of what&#x2019;s to come. In a sense nothing much is, because nothing much happens to the characters, but the last thing the reader feels is disappointment. (<i>Offshore </i>has indeed an astonishing climax and conclusion, but it gives us the pure pleasure of accomplished art, rather than the mere surprise of an unexpected ending.)<br><br>Although always unobtrusive, the moments of drama in the novel are, in their own way, devastating. No one has ever described a husband&#x2014;wife &#x2018;quarrel&#x2019; with such appallingly accurate charity as Fitzgerald gives us in the scene between Nenna, longing to have her husband back, and Edward, longing to be taken back, but finding himself, as men do, in an impasse of perverse pride and muddled vehemence. All she can say is &#x2018;please give&#x2019; and when he angrily demands &#x2018;what&#x2019;, she can only say &#x2018;anything&#x2019;. But she has managed, as he has not, to say that she wants him every moment and to remember that one of his few accomplishments is the ability to fold up a map properly, something she herself can never do.<br><br>Although the author never says so, it is clear that the boat itself, the <i>Grace </i>(meaningfully incongruous name), and the way of life on the river, have really come between them. The little girls love their life and everything about the Thames &#x2014; the mud, and the mess, and the chances of finding even quite valuable broken tiles on the muddy foreshore. Again the author makes us see, without stating the fact, how and why they love it, and yet how impossible it has become as a life for their elders.<br><br><i>Offshore </i>is in some ways a sad book as well as a searching one, although sadness, like so many other things in the novel, is mingled with a kind of accepting gaiety. In <i>Human Voices</i>, Fitzgerald takes up again her own style and form of comedy. It is a most amazing book and, like all her books, a charitable one, although it may have made a few faces blush at the BBC. As the river is the essential background of <i>Offshore</i>, so London in wartime is presided over by the sound of those cultivated voices mediating the war to the British public. It is tempting to wonder whether there is a sly reference in the title to the<br>concluding lines of T. S. Eliot&#x2019;s &#x2018;The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock&#x2019;:<br><br>We have lingered in the chambers of the sea<br>By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown<br>Till human voices wake us, and we drown.<br><br>Penelope Fitzgerald had been a sea-girl herself, so to speak, in the offices of the Cporation; and she loved a subtle or oblique joke as much as anybody. As a critic pointed out when <i>Human Voices </i>was published, although the temptation is to read fast because the novel is so delightfully readable, it is better to go slowly so as not to miss the jokes. There are plenty of them below that demure surface.<br> <br><i>The Beginning of Spring </i>has all the fascination of its predecessors and much more beside. &#x2018;Open the doors,&#x2019; runs a Russian proverb, quoted by Penelope Fitzgerald, &#x2018;here comes trouble.&#x2019; It is a very Russian proverb, for Russians are convinced that since trouble will come anyway it should be greeted with an appropriate hospitality. There is plenty of trouble in this strangely magical and in some ways very Russian novel, but there are other things too, including the promise of spring, and indeed its beginning, when all the double windows in Moscow houses are taken out, in readiness for the few short months of summer. Not the least magical aspect of the book, as if it were a Russian fairy-tale mixed with the innocent sophistication of a story by Chekhov, is the way in which the author has, as it were, contrived to Russianize her imagination while leaving its inherent Englishness still in place. Quite how she has discovered, absorbed, and made her own use of so much Russian material remains her secret. Perhaps a Knox uncle or two may have been useful? &#x2014; who knows.<br><br>So authentic is the feel of the book that we may be baffled, and even unsatisfied at first, as much by the tone as by the intention. Penelope Fitzgerald has always given the feeling, in her fiction, of the way things are muddled up in life, but here such an impression is more overwhelming than ever, and seems, too, more cunningly engineered by a sophisticated process of art. Almost as in her first novel, the &#x2018;mystery&#x2019;, and its solution, seem to lie in the fact that there was no mystery in the first place, only the appearance of one. In this case it is Nellie &#x2014; Mrs Reid, wife of an English printer in Moscow &#x2014; going away, and then at the end, returning. Why does she do it? We don&#x2019;t know &#x2014; any more, we might feel, than a lot of things which are never to be known or understood: in Russia,<br>or, indeed, in the world at large. But so far from being frustrating or disappointing this effect of the novel seems, in its own way, both logical and deeply satisfying.<br><br>The humour of the book, never laborious or attempting to show itself off, is one of its joys. Frank Reid&#x2019;s assistant at the printing works, Selwyn Crane, is perhaps the nearest Penelope Fitzgerald comes to creating a &#x2018;character&#x2019;, and a comic one at that. He is one of those people most of us have somewhere in our lives who invariably manage to occupy, as one might say, the moral high ground. When Reid&#x2019;s wife Nellie leaves home &#x2014; and it may be for no other reason than that she finds life in Moscow, with an English husband born and bred there, too unnatural, indeed too exacting, for her &#x2014; Selwyn is at once on hand to give his own peculiar variety of consolation. Poor Frank puts his head in his hands, feeling that &#x2018;he could bear anything rather than determined unselfishness&#x2019;. Selwyn<br>makes everyone else feel guilty, as Frank tells him in a burst of exasperation, and when things are sorted out Selwyn can think of nothing but &#x2018;his next charitable enterprise&#x2019;. Now, &#x2018;with the terrible aimlessness of the benevolent, he was casting round for a new misfortune.&#x2019; On top of all this, the part he has played in the decamping of Nellie Reid seems to be a puzzling or, even, an equivocal one.<br><br>Such things, however, don&#x2019;t greatly matter: indeed one of the strange things about this jewel of a book is how little things like that do seem to matter; and yet we are always gripped by what is happening, and pleasantly taken up with wondering what might happen next. This is in a sense the old atmosphere of fantasy and fairy-tale, brought up to date here and with its species of strangeness never far away, and yet always strictly and beautifully down to earth. Penelope Fitzgerald&#x2019;s children &#x2014; Frank&#x2019;s Dolly, Ben and Annushka in <i>The Beginning of Spring</i>, like Nenna&#x2019;s Tilda and Martha in <i>Offshore </i>&#x2014; seem so natural a part of their author&#x2019;s highly individual world that they are wholly pleasing and acceptable, even to those of us who would normally be highly suspicious of child characters in fiction. <br><br>As much a part of the suggestiveness and material imagination of the story is the young girl from the big shop, Lisa, employed by Frank on Selwyn&#x2019;s advice to help look after the three children. What part Lisa subsequently plays in Frank&#x2019;s own life &#x2014; emotionally, even perhaps sexually &#x2014; is all a part of the artful mystery of the book&#x2019;s development. Frank and a Russian friend go, at the friend&#x2019;s suggestion, to a fashionable Moscow teashop called Rusalochka&#x2019;s. In Russian mythology a Rusalka is a water-sprite, once human, who has drowned herself when forsaken by a human lover. Sometimes, as in Pushkin&#x2019;s magical poem, she has borne a daughter in her new transformation, in fact a Rusalochka, who will herself sexually tempt her mother&#x2019;s faithless lover. Penelope Fitzgerald&#x2019;s meticulous inventiveness is much too subtle to labour this legend, or for any of the normal signposts and suggestions of symbolism, but the relationship between Lisa and Selwyn, and Lisa and Frank and his vanished wife, teases the reader &#x2014; not into a search for clues, but into the superior enjoyments of aesthetic questioning and wondering.<br><br>No wonder, too, that Anita Brookner, writing in the <i>Spectator, </i>was sure that the novel had &#x2018;mastered a city, a landscape and a vanished time&#x2019; in producing a work of art which was &#x2018;part novel, part evocation&#x2019;, done with &#x2018;a calm confidence behind its apparent simplicity&#x2019;. That confidence in handling material so far distant from the normal domestic field which English novelists have made so distinctively their own, from Jane Austen to Barbara Pym and Anita Brookner herself, is indeed a very special achievement of Penelope Fitzgerald; and <i>The Beginning of Spring</i>, when it appeared in 1988, was the surest example of a triumph that was to be repeated in her novels to come.<br><br>John Bayley</p><h2>Angels in the Gloom: A Novel (World War I)</h2><p>With this latest entry in a bestselling series that evokes all the passion and heroism of history&#x2019;s most heartbreaking conflict&#x2013;the war that was meant to end all wars&#x2013;Anne Perry adds new luster to her worldwide reputation.<br><br>Angels in the Gloom is an intense saga of love, hate, obsession, and murder that features an honorable English family&#x2013;brothers Joseph and Matthew Reavley and their sisters, Judith and Hannah.<br><br>In March 1916, Joseph, a chaplain at the front, and Judith, an ambulance driver, are fighting not only the Germans but the bitter cold and the appalling casualties at Ypres.

Earlier in the night a score of men had gone over the top in a raid on the German trenches. They had taken a couple of prisoners, but been hit by a hail of fire on the way back. They had scrambled over the parapet wounded, bleeding, and without Doughy Ward and Tucky Nunn.<br><br>&#x201c;Oi think Doughy&#x2019;s bought it,&#x201d; Barshey Gee had said miserably, his face hollow-eyed in the brief glare of a star shell. &#x201c;But Tucky was still aloive.&#x201d;<br><br>There was no choice. Under a barrage from their own guns, three of them went to look for him. The noise of the heavy mortars was deafening, but when they eased, Joseph could hear the quick, sharper rattle of machine guns. As the flare died, he lifted his head to look again across the craters, the torn wire, and the few shattered tree stumps still left.<br><br>Something moved in the mud. Joseph crawled forward again as quickly as he could. The thin ice cracked under his weight but he could hear nothing over the guns. He must get to Tucky without sliding into any of the huge, water-filled holes. Men had drowned in them before now. He shuddered at the thought. At least they had not been gassed this week, so there were no deadly, choking fumes in the hollows.<br><br>Another flare went up and he lay still, then as it faded he moved forward as rapidly as he could, feeling his way to avoid the remnants of spent shells, the tangles of old wire and rusted weapons, the rotting bodies. As always, he had emergency first aid supplies with him, but he might need more than that. If he could carry Tucky back to the trench, there would be real medics there by now.<br><br>It was dark again. He stood up and, crouching low, ran forward. It was only a few yards to where he had seen the movement. He slithered and almost fell over him.<br><br>&#x201c;Tucky!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Chaplain,&#x201d; Tucky&#x2019;s voice came out of the darkness, hoarse, ending in a cough.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, I&#x2019;ve got you.&#x201d; Joseph reached forward, grasped the rough khaki, and felt the weight of Tucky&#x2019;s body. &#x201c;Where are you hurt?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing out here?&#x201d; There was a kind of desperate humor in Tucky&#x2019;s voice as he tried to mask his pain. Another flare went up, briefly illuminating his snub-nosed face and the bloody wound in his shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;Just passing,&#x201d; Joseph replied, his own voice shaking a little. &#x201c;Where else are you hit?&#x201d; He dreaded the answer. If it were only the shoulder, Tucky would have made his way back.<br><br>&#x201c;Moi leg, Oi think,&#x201d; came the reply. &#x201c;Tell you the truth, Oi can&#x2019;t feel much. So damn cold. Don&#x2019;t seem they have summers here. &#x2019;Member summers at home, Chaplain? Girls all . . .&#x201d; The rest of what he said was drowned in another roar of gunfire.<br><br>Joseph&#x2019;s heart sank. He had seen too many die, young men he had known most of their lives, including Tucky&#x2019;s elder brother Bibby.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get you back,&#x201d; he said to Tucky. &#x201c;Once you&#x2019;re warmer you&#x2019;ll probably feel it like hell. Come on.&#x201d; He bent and half lifted Tucky onto his back. Hearing a cry of pain as he inadvertently touched the wound, he apologized.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all roight, Chaplain,&#x201d; Tucky gasped, gagging as the pain dizzied him. &#x201c;It hurts, but not too much. Oi&#x2019;ll be better soon.&#x201d;<br><br>Bent double, staggering under Tucky&#x2019;s weight, and trying to keep low so as not to make a target, Joseph floundered back toward the line of the trenches. Twice he slipped and fell, apologizing automatically, aware that he was banging and jolting the injured man.<br><br>He saw the parapet ahead of him, not more than a dozen yards away. He was sodden with mud and water up to the waist. His breath froze in the air and he was so cold he could hardly feel his legs.<br><br>&#x201c;Nearly there,&#x201d; he told Tucky, although his words were lost in another barrage of shells. One exploded close to him, hurling him forward flat onto the ground. He felt a sickening pain in his left side, and then nothing.<br><br> He opened his eyes with a headache so blinding it all but obliterated his awareness that the whole of his left side hurt. There seemed to be other people around him. He could hear voices. It took him sev- eral moments to recognize that he was staring up at the ceiling of the field hospital. He must have been hit. What had happened to Tucky?<br><br>He tried to speak, but he was not sure if he actually made any sound or if the words were only in his head. No one came to him. He seemed to have no strength to move. The pain was appalling. It consumed his whole body, almost taking his breath away. What had happened to him? He had seen men injured, lots of them, their arms and legs blown off, bodies ripped open. He had held them, talked to them as they died, trying simply to be there so they were not alone. Sometimes that was all he could do.<br><br>He could not take up arms&#x2014;he was a chaplain&#x2014;but the night before the war had been declared, he had promised himself he would be there with the men, endure with them whatever happened.<br><br>Matthew and Judith, his brother and younger sister, had sat at home with him in St. Giles, watching the darkness gather over the fields, and spoken quietly of the future. Matthew would stay in the Secret Intelligence Service, Judith would go to the front to do what she could, probably to drive ambulances, Joseph would be a chaplain. But he had sworn that never again would he allow himself to care about anything so much that he could be crippled by loss, as he had been by Eleanor&#x2019;s death, and the baby&#x2019;s. Naturally his married sister, Hannah, would stay at home. Her husband, Archie, was at sea, and she had three children to care for.<br><br>There was someone leaning over him, a man with fair hair and a tired, serious face. He had blood on his hands and clothes. &#x201c;Captain Reavley?&#x201d;<br><br>Joseph tried to answer but all he could manage was a croak.<br><br>&#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Cavan,&#x201d; the man went on. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the surgeon here. You&#x2019;ve got a badly broken left arm. You caught a pretty big piece of shrapnel by the look of it, and you&#x2019;ve lost rather a lot of blood from the wound in your leg, but you should be all right. You&#x2019;ll keep the arm, but I&#x2019;m afraid it is definitely a Blighty one.&#x201d;<br><br>Joseph knew what that meant: an injury bad enough to be sent home.<br><br>&#x201c;Tucky?&#x201d; The words came at last, in a whisper. &#x201c;Tucky Nunn?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bad, but I expect he&#x2019;ll make it,&#x201d; Cavan answered. &#x201c;Probably going home with you. Now we&#x2019;ve got to do something about this arm. It&#x2019;s going to hurt, but I&#x2019;ll do my best, and we&#x2019;ll repack that wound in your leg.&#x201d;<br><br>Joseph knew dimly that the doctor had no time to say more. There were too many other men waiting, perhaps injured more seriously than he.<br><br>Cavan was right; the surgery was painful. Afterward, all Joseph did was swim in and out of consciousness. Everything seemed either the scarlet of pain or the infinitely better black of oblivion.<br><br>He was half aware of being lifted and carried, of voices around him, and then a few very clear moments when he saw Judith. She was bending over him, her face pale and grave, and he realized with surprise how frightened she was. He must look pretty bad. He tried to smile. He had no idea from the tears in her eyes if he succeeded or not. Then he drifted away again.<br><br>He woke up every so often. Sometimes he lay staring at the ceiling, wanting to scream from the pain that coursed through him till he thought he could not bear it, but one did not do that. Other men, with worse injuries, did not. There were nurses around him, footsteps, voices, hands holding him up, making him drink something that made him gag. People spoke to him gently; there was a woman&#x2019;s voice, encouraging, but too busy for pity.<br><br>He felt helpless, but it was a relief not to be responsible for anyone&#x2019;s pain except his own.<br><br>He was hot and shivering, the sweat trickling down his body, when they finally put him on the train. The rattle and jolt of it was dreadful, and he wanted to shout at the people who said how lucky he was to have &#x201c;a Blighty one&#x201d; that he would rather they left him alone where he was. It must still be March and the weather was erratic. Would the winds make the Channel crossing rough? He was too ill to cope with seasickness as well! He could not even turn over.<br><br>In the event he remembered very little of it, or of the train journey afterward. When he finally woke up to some kind of clarity, he was lying in a clean bed in a hospital ward. The sun shone through the windows, making bright, warm splashes on the wooden floor, and there were bedclothes around him. Clean sheets? He could feel the smoothness against his chin and smell the cotton. He heard a broad Cambridgeshire voice in the distance and found himself smiling. He was in England, and it was spring.<br><br>He kept his eyes open, afraid that if he closed them it would all disappear and he would be back in the mud again. A slight woman, perhaps in her fifties, bent over him and helped him up to drink a cup of tea. It was hot, and made with clean water, not the stale dregs he was used to. The woman was dressed in a starched white uniform. She told him her name was Gwen Neave. He looked at her hands around the cup as she held it to his lips. They were strong and sunburned.<br><br>During the next two or three days and nights she seemed to be there every time he needed her, always understanding what would ease him a little: the bed remade, pillows turned and plumped up, fresh water to drink, a cold cloth on his brow. She changed the dressings on the huge, raw wounds in his arm and leg without any expression on her face except a tightening of her lips when she knew it must be hurting him. She talked about the weather, the lengthening days, the first daffodils flowering bright yellow. She told him once, very briefly, that she had two sons in the navy, but nothing more, no mention of where they were or how she feared for them amid all the losses at sea. He admired her for that.<br><br>It was she who was there at the worst times in the small hours of the morning when he was racked with pain, biting his lips so he did not cry out. He thought of other men&#x2019;s pain, younger than he, who had barely tasted life and were already robbed of it. He had no strength left to fight; he only wanted to escape to a place where the pain stopped.<br><br>&#x201c;It will get better,&#x201d; she promised him, her voice little more than a whisper so as not to disturb the men in the other beds.<br><br>He did not answer. The words meant nothing. Pain, helplessness, and the knowledge of death were the only realities.</p><h2>Nightwalking: A Nocturnal History of London</h2><p>&#x201c;Cities, like cats, will reveal themselves at night,&#x201d; wrote the poet Rupert Brooke. Before the age of electricity, the nighttime city was a very different place to the one we know today&#x2014;home to the lost, the vagrant and the noctambulant. Matthew Beaumont recounts an alternative history of London by focusing on those of its denizens who surface on the streets when the sun&#x2019;s down. If nightwalking is a matter of &#x201c;going astray&#x201d; in the streets of the metropolis after dark, then nightwalkers represent some of the most suggestive and revealing guides to the neglected and forgotten aspects of the city.<br><br>In this brilliant work of literary investigation, Beaumont shines a light on the shadowy perambulations of poets, novelists and thinkers: Chaucer and Shakespeare; William Blake and his ecstatic peregrinations and the feverish ramblings of opium addict Thomas De Quincey; and, among the lamp-lit literary throng, the supreme nightwalker Charles Dickens. We discover how the nocturnal city has inspired some and served as a balm or narcotic to others. In each case, the city is revealed as a place divided between work and pleasure, the affluent and the indigent, where the entitled and the desperate jostle in the streets.<br><br>With a foreword and afterword by Will Self, <i>Nightwalkin</i>g is a captivating literary portrait of the writers who explore the city at night and the people they meet.</p><p><b>Matthew Beaumont</b> is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of English at University College London.

In her twentieth William Monk mystery, she brings us to London&#x2019;s grand Mayfair mansions, where the arrogant masters of the Western world hold sway&#x2014;and to the teeming Thames waterfront, where one summer afternoon, Monk witnesses the horrifying explosion of the pleasure boat <i>Princess Mary,</i> which sends to their deaths nearly two hundred merrymakers.<br> &nbsp;<br> The tragedy is no accident. As commander of the River Police, Monk should handle the case, but the investigation is turned over to the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. An Egyptian man is swiftly caught, tried, and sentenced to die. But almost as quickly, Monk presents evidence that Habib Beshara, though a nasty piece of work, was elsewhere at the time of the blast. The investigation, now in complete disarray, is hastily turned over to Monk.<br> &nbsp;<br> Is the crime connected with the soon-to-be-opened Suez Canal, which will enormously benefit wealthy British shipping companies? Or did all of those innocent people drown to ensure the death of just one? How did the bomber board the ship, and how did he manage to escape? Is he an anarchist or a madman?<br> &nbsp;<br> Backed up by his astute wife, Hester, and his old reliable friend Oliver Rathbone, Monk vows to find answers&#x2014;but instead finds himself treading the dangerous waters of international intrigue, his questions politely turned aside by a formidable array of the powerful and privileged. Events twist and turn like the Thames itself, leading to the shattering moment when Monk realizes, perhaps too late, that he is the next target.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for Anne Perry and her William Monk novels</b><br> <b>&nbsp;<br><i>Blood on the Water</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;[An] unfailingly rewarding series.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Riveting . . . one of Perry&#x2019;s most engrossing books.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Times</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Tension-filled . . . intricate and densely plotted . . .

Ships from every country on earth lay at anchor, riding lights swaying in the dusk wind. The sun was low in the early summer sky and streaks of red flared across the west.<br><br>Behind him, at the other oar, Orme rested also. He was a quiet man who had worked on the river all his life.<br><br>&#x201c;Good sight, eh, sir?&#x201d; he said, his wind-ï¿½burned face creased in satisfaction. &#x201c;I reckon there ain&#x2019;t none like it in the world.&#x201d;<br><br>Monk smiled. For Orme that was an emotional&#x2014;ï¿½and lengthy&#x2014;ï¿½speech. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; he agreed.<br><br>In unison they bent to their oars again. There was a pleasure boat a hundred yards or so in front of them, and they could hear the music and the laughter echoing from the lantern-ï¿½strung decks, even from this distance. The boat had probably been out most of the day, perhaps as far as Gravesend on the estuary. It was perfect weather for it.<br><br>Some young men were playing around, mock fighting&#x2014;ï¿½too close to the rail, Monk thought. They ought to be more careful. The Thames current was deceptively swift, and the water filthy.<br><br>A few other small boats dotted the water close by, one within yards of the pleasure boat.<br><br>Monk frowned as a man on the deck shouted loudly and waved his arms, running towards the railing as if he would jump over it.<br><br>Then suddenly there was a shattering roar and a great gout of flame leaped from the bow. Debris shot high into the air and the column of light seared Monk&#x2019;s eyes. Instinctively he ducked as the shock wave struck, and pieces of wood and metal pelted into the water around him and Orme with deafening splashes. As one, they grasped the oars and fought to steady the boat in the turbulence that washed out from the stricken vessel.<br><br>There seemed to be bodies everywhere, people thrashing in the water, shouting above the din.<br><br>Monk was speechless, his chest almost too tight to draw breath. Without a word, he and Orme dug the oars in deep to race into the nightmare, shoulders bent, muscles straining, oblivious of everything but the horror.<br><br>Even as they rowed, the gaping hole in what was left of the bow was swallowed in water; and, huge paddles still turning, the boat plunged beneath the surface.<br><br>Within minutes they reached the first body: a man floating face up, eyes wide and sightless. They tried to lift him before realizing that both his legs were gone, bloody stumps half obscured in the filth of the river. He was beyond their help. Monk&#x2019;s stomach clenched as he let the corpse fall back into the water.<br><br>The second victim they found was a woman, her huge skirts already sodden and dragging her down. It took all Monk&#x2019;s strength to heave her aboard and Orme&#x2019;s very considerable skill to keep the boat steady. She was barely conscious, but there were too many others sinking fast to take the time to revive her. All they could do was put her as gently as possible face downward so the water she spewed did not drown her.<br><br>They worked in perfect synchronization, bending, lifting, keeping the boat from capsizing as it swung and tipped with their movement, and the clutching of desperate hands as white faces upturned in the gloom. It seemed few in the water could swim, and those who could were losing strength fast. Monk reached for one swimmer and felt fingers like iron digging into his flesh as he heaved him aboard.<br><br>He and Orme were both soaked to the skin, muscles aching, arms bruised. Monk&#x2019;s heart beat in his throat as if it would choke him. He could not do enough, not nearly enough.<br><br>It was only minutes after the explosion when the last of the boat slid into the dark river and disappeared. There was nothing left but the cries, the debris, and the bodies&#x2014;ï¿½some motionless, some still fighting to stay above the water.<br><br>Other boats were coming. A ferry was less than forty feet away. As it swung around and the men reached over to pull people from the water, the fading sunlight momentarily illuminated a picture and a name painted on the stern. A barge was making its way slowly, dragged against the current as it came closer. The bargee was bending and reaching out to help those closest to him. A small coal freighter was flinging barrels and scrap wood overboard; anything that anyone in the water could clutch on to to help them float before their imprisoning clothes dragged them, still screaming, under.<br><br>Monk and Orme had heaved six exhausted people out of the water, but that was all they dared carry. Sick with misery, they had to beat off others whose weight would have sunk the boat. Monk had to forcibly push one man away from the gunwales with the blade of his oar, afraid that he would overturn the boat in his frantic attempt to climb aboard.<br><br>They pulled for the shore, hearing the repeated thanks of the survivors who were huddled together, trying to assist one another in the body of the boat, holding up those barely conscious. Men on the banks were wading as far as they could, roped together, stretching out to lift and help.<br><br>Monk and Orme went back out again into the near darkness, directed now as much by cries as by sight. They pulled several more people out of the water, and rowed them ashore.<br><br>Monk lost all track of time. He was wet to the skin and so cold he was shaking, yet he and Orme could not give up. If there was even one person still alive in that black water, then they must find him or her.<br><br>It seemed every man in the River Police was here with them, and all manner of others joined in, united in their horror and grief. The banks were lined with people offering aid. Some pushed mugs of hot tea and whisky into freezing hands, helping the rescued to hold on and drink. Others had blankets; some even had their own spare, dry clothes.<br><br>The moon was high in the sky when Monk and Orme finally moored the boat and climbed wearily up the steps from the river to the level dockside, acknowledging in a glance that they had done all they could. The wind had risen and scythed across the open stretch in front of the Wapping Police Station, which was their headquarters.<br><br>Monk hunched into his coat instinctively but it was pointless when everything he wore was soaking wet. He increased his pace. Weary as he was, the cold was worse. He could hardly feel his feet and all his bones ached. The palms of his hands were blistered so he could barely move them.<br><br>He reached the door with Orme a step behind him. Inside, the woodstove was lit. The air was blessedly warm.<br><br>Sergeant Jackson came bustling toward them immediately, attending to Monk first, as rank demanded.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better get them clothes off, sir. We got plenty o&#x2019; dry ones in the cupboard. Not your taste, sir, bein&#x2019; a bit of a dandy like you are. But dry&#x2019;s all that matters now, or you&#x2019;ll catch your death. Beggin&#x2019; yer pardon, sir, but you look like hell!&#x201d;<br><br>Monk was shaking so hard his teeth were chattering and it was beyond his control to stop. &#x201c;I thought hell was supposed to be hot!&#x201d; he said with an attempt at a smile.<br><br>&#x201c;No, sir, cold an&#x2019; wet. Ask any seaman, &#x2019;e&#x2019;ll tell you,&#x201d; Jackson replied. He turned to Orme. &#x201c;You too, Mr. Orme. You don&#x2019;t look no better. When you come out I&#x2019;ll &#x2019;ave an &#x2019;ot mug o&#x2019; tea for yer wi&#x2019; a good dash o&#x2019; whisky in it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A very good dash, if you please,&#x201d; Monk added. He wanted the fire of it to take the edge off the horror inside him, the pity and guilt he felt for those he had not saved. He sat down and let the warmth of the fire wrap around him like a blanket, for a moment obliterating everything else.<br><br>Jackson did not say anything, but bustled about preparing the tea. He had spent all his life on the river, like Orme. He had seen other tragedies before, but nothing like this. He had been there all evening organizing men and boats, and answering desperate questions as well as he could.<br><br>Twenty minutes later, skin toweled hard enough to hurt, in clean, dry clothes, but still conscious of the stench of the river on his skin and in his hair, Monk sat near the stove and sipped his tea. It was piping hot, and at least half whisky. Orme was in the chair beside him, and Jackson was fussing over the next men to come in.<br><br>&#x201c;That explosion,&#x201d; Orme said grimly, pulling a face as the tea burned his mouth, &#x201c;couldn&#x2019;t have been the boiler. The explosion came from the bow, nowhere near the engines. So what the devil was it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t see any other way it could&#x2019;ve been an accident,&#x201d; Monk said. &#x201c;That only leaves sabotage.&#x201d;<br><br>Orme scowled. &#x201c;Why, sir? What kind of a madman would blow up a pleasure boat? It doesn&#x2019;t make any sense.&#x201d;<br><br>Monk thought about it for several moments. He was exhausted. Few ideas made sense. Why would anyone intentionally sink a pleasure boat? There was no cargo to steal or destroy, only people to kill. Was it an enmity against the owners of the boat? A business rivalry or vendetta? Or perhaps a grudge against some guests on the boat? Was it political? Or even an act of war by some insane foreign power or a group of anarchists?<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know yet. Perhaps someone who hates Britain,&#x201d; Monk said finally. &#x201c;There are a few of those.&#x201d; He finished the last of his tea and stood up, stumbling a little but quickly regaining his balance.<br><br>The door swung open and Hooper came in. He was a tall, loose-ï¿½limbed man and was shedding water with every step. His face was haggard with grief. He didn&#x2019;t say a word, but folded himself up into one of the chairs as Jackson stood up to fetch him tea.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d better go and speak to the survivors,&#x201d; Monk said quietly to Orme. &#x201c;Somebody must have seen something. Big question is&#x2014;ï¿½did whoever did it escape, or did they intend to go down with the boat?&#x201d; He put his hand on Hooper&#x2019;s shoulder for a moment. Words between them were unnecessary.<br><br>Orme set his mug down. &#x201c;God help us, we really are talking about madness, aren&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br><br>Monk did not bother to answer. He walked out into the night, his face cold again after the warmth of the room. In the clear sky moonlight spread a silver path across the river and the dark debris floating on its surface. He shivered at the thought that the boats still out there were only picking up bodies now, although most of the dead would be trapped in the wreck, settling into mud on the riverbed.<br><br>As he moved across the open space toward the dockside he thought of what he must do, and dreaded it. But it was inescapably his job. He was Commander of the Thames River Police. Any crime on the river was his responsibility, and this was the worst incident in living memory. There must have been the best part of two hundred people on the boat. The bereaved would be numerous. At the moment the whole tragedy seemed chaotic, senseless. Where could he begin?<br><br>Coleman, one of his own men, approached him in the dark. Monk could hardly see his face, but his voice when he spoke was rough-ï¿½edged, only just in control.<br><br>&#x201c;Looks like we saved about fifty, sir. Got most of them here on the north bank.&#x201d; He coughed, his throat tight. &#x201c;Put &#x2019;em anywhere we can. You could start with that warehouse over there, Stillman&#x2019;s. A lot of survivors there and they&#x2019;re making room for more, if there are any. All sorts &#x2019;ave come with blankets, clothes, tea, whisky, anything that can help.&#x201d; He coughed again. &#x201c;Got half a dozen sent to hospital, too, but I can&#x2019;t see how they&#x2019;ll make it. That water&#x2019;s like to poison you even if you don&#x2019;t drown in it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Coleman.&#x201d; Monk nodded and walked on. The warehouse was close. He needed to put his emotions aside and concentrate on the questions he had to ask and the answers he needed to know to begin to make sense of this.<br><br>He picked his way between the boxes, kegs, and bales outside in the warehouse yard. He went up the step to the cracks of light he could see around the door.<br><br>Inside, the warehouse was lit by bull&#x2019;s-ï¿½eye lanterns, and there were a dozen or so people lying on the floor wrapped in blankets. Several women were ministering to them with hot drinks and towels, in some cases rubbing their arms and legs, all the time talking to them gently. Only a few glanced up at Monk&#x2019;s entry. He did not look like a policeman; he was exhausted, unshaven, and dressed in ill-ï¿½fitting waterman&#x2019;s clothes.<br><br>&#x201c;My name is Monk,&#x201d; he introduced himself to a woman carrying towels and bandages. &#x201c;River Police. We need to find out what happened. Which of these people can I speak to?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Does it have to be now?&#x201d; the woman said sharply. Her face was gray with fatigue, eyes red-ï¿½rimmed. There were stains of dirt and blood down the front of her dress.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said quietly. &#x201c;Before they forget.&#x201d;<br><br>Another, older, woman rose to her feet from where she had been helping a man sip a hot drink. She was strongly built, her clothes so worn they were faded in patches where the pattern had been rubbed off the cloth. In the yellow light of the lantern her face suggested not only weariness but disgust.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s unlikely they&#x2019;ll forget!&#x201d; she said between her teeth. &#x201c;They will probably relive it the rest of their lives!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;None of us will forget the horror,&#x201d; Monk answered her quietly. &#x201c;But it wasn&#x2019;t an accident. I need to know who did this, and for that I need details only they can provide.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Find whoever built the damn boat!&#x201d; she retorted bitterly, turning away from him and towards a man cradling a broken arm.<br><br>Monk put his hand on her arm, holding her firmly. He felt her tense and then pull against him. &#x201c;It was an explosion,&#x201d; he said between his teeth. &#x201c;The whole bow blew out; there was a hole in it you could drive a coach and four through.&#x201d;<br><br>She turned back to him, her eyes wide. &#x201c;Who told you that?&#x201d;</p><h2>Wings, Women, and War: Soviet Airwomen in World War II Combat (Modern War Studies)</h2><p>The Soviet Union was the first nation to allow women pilots to fly combat missions. During World War II the Red Air Force formed three all-female units&#x2014;grouped into separate fighter, dive bomber, and night bomber regiments&#x2014;while also recruiting other women to fly with mostly male units. Their amazing story, fully recounted for the first time by Reina Pennington, honors a group of fearless and determined women whose exploits have not yet received the recognition they deserve. <br><br>Pennington chronicles the creation, organization, and leadership of these regiments, as well as the experiences of the pilots, navigators, bomb loaders, mechanics, and others who made up their ranks, all within the context of the Soviet air war on the Eastern Front. These regiments flew a combined total of more than 30,000 combat sorties, produced at least thirty Heroes of the Soviet Union, and included at least two fighter aces. <br><br>Among their ranks were women like Marina Raskova ("the Soviet Amelia Earhart"), a renowned aviator who persuaded Stalin in 1941 to establish the all-women regiments; the daredevil "night witches" who flew ramshackle biplanes on nocturnal bombing missions over German frontlines; and fighter aces like Liliia Litviak, whose twelve "kills" are largely unknown in the West. She also tells the story of Alexander Gridnev, a fighter pilot twice arrested by the Soviet secret police before he was chosen to command the women's fighter regiment. <br><br>Pennington draws upon personal interviews and the Soviet archives to detail the recruitment, training, and combat lives of these women. Deftly mixing anecdote with analysis, her work should find a wide readership among scholars and buffs interested in the history of aviation, World War II, or the Russian military, as well as anyone concerned with the contentious debates surrounding military and combat service for women.</p><p>"Pennington's chilling tale of savage combat and incredible bravery and of the struggle of these pilots for recognition and acceptance will forever bury the myth that women cannot fight. A masterful and groundbreaking account of courageous women warriors."--Carlo D'Este, author of <i>Patton: A Genius for War</i><p> </p><p>"Pennington conveys wholly fresh, vivid, often unique and revealing insights drawn from a formidable and fascinating array of evidence. Much of her book is deeply moving. It is impossible not to be stirred, even appalled, by the fate of some of these women."--John Erickson, author of <i>The Road to Stalingrad</i></p><p> </p><p>"Pennington's meticulous research, dogged investigative skills, and clear writing make this book an instant classic in its field and a virtual model for future authors who write on the subject of women in war."--David M. Glantz, coauthor of <i>The Battle of Kursk</i> </p><p>"A fine, detailed study of the conflict between combat roles and gender roles. Must reading for all serious students of women's military history."--Linda Grant De Pauw, author of <i>Battle Cries and Lullabies</i></p>Reina Pennington, a former intelligence officer with the Air Force and Defense Intelligence Agency, is director of Peace, War and Diplomacy Studies at Norwich University in Vermont.

Every year, a thriving international festival takes place at Angoulme (France) to celebrate graphic novels, a popular art form as well respected as any literary genre. In fact, there are all kinds of BD for both adults and children. They are available everywhere from the village bookshop to the supermarket via cultural media stores like La FNAC or Virgin. My personal love of BD was kindled while living in France. However, it wasn't until the birth of my first son in 1988 that I saw any need to translate and publish them. The struggle of translating them for every bedtime story told me that there had to be an easier way! So, from a desire to have a ready and plentiful supply of these wonderful books available in English, Glo'worm was eventually born in early 1998. Conscious that the English reading public at large was not properly aware of BD, and out of admiration for the work of Goscinny (the author of <i>Asterix</i>), I decided to start with another of his characters: Lucky Luke. Lucky Luke is this super cool cowboy who, with his wisecracking horse Jolly Jumper, protects the population West of the Mississippi from the exaction of all kinds of villains, some real (The Daltons, Jesse James) and some invented. The stories, always well researched, combine fact, fiction and humorous send off with a refreshing lack of political correctness. So far, we have published four titles - <i>Calamity Jane</i>, <i>Jesse James</i>, <i>Dalton City and <i>The Tenderfoot</i>. In total, there are over 60 Lucky Luke titles. An amazing success story worldwide for the last 50 years, there are 250 million Lucky Luke books in print in over 26 languages worldwide. From my own research, the ecstatic response to the BD by my children and their friends proved beyond any doubt that these books deserve to be read by English speakers and that English speaking children deserve the opportunity to read them. Glo'worm sets out to give them this opportunity.</i>The character of Lucky Luke became a legend thanks to Morris (his creator) and Goscinny. These two giants of the 9th art collaborated with passion for more than 20 years until the death of the famous scriptwriter. Rene Goscinny (Lucky Luke, Asterix, Iznogoud, le Petit Nicolas) is one of the most-read French authors in the world. Approximately 500 million copies of his books have been sold.In 1992, Morris received the &#34;Grand Prix Special 20eme Anniversaire&#34; from the international comics show at Angouleme, and in 1998, the French Minister of Culture decorated him with the rank of &#34;Officier des Arts et des Lettres.&#34;</p><h2>On Practice and Contradiction (Revolutions)</h2><p>These early philosophical writings underpinned the Chinese revolutions, and their clarion calls to insurrection remain some of the most stirring of all time.

We now have unprecedented opportunities to meet people from every culture and nation. International study and global migration allow us to build relationships with Buddhists and Muslims, students from Singapore and workers from the Middle East. But how do we share the gospel with people from different cultures and worldviews? Crosscultural evangelism can be scary. But veteran crosscultural minister Katie Rawson shows how we can witness the way Jesus did, entering into people&#39;s worlds and drawing them into God-centered community. She equips readers to evangelize Jesus&#39; way, depending on him as companion and guide and venturing out in joy to be and share good news. Filled with compelling stories, practical resources and relational tools, this guide gives crosscultural training and shows how you can share the gospel through story and diagram, with clear communication and authentic community.</p><p>Katie J. Rawson (DMiss, Fuller Theological Seminary; PhD, University of North Carolina) is senior resource developer with International Student Ministry (ISM) at InterVarsity Christian Fellowship in Raleigh, NC. She has ministered among international students for over three decades and is a contributor to <em>Passport to the Bible: An Explorer's Guide</em>."Combining her extensive experience, great stories, disciplines of spiritual formation and thought-provoking reflection exercises, Katie Rawson has given us a go-to guide for training in crosscultural understanding, friendships and outreach. She helps the reader understand crosscultural conversion, worldviews and values, and spiritual warfare. This is a read-this-book-first resource for those who want to cross the street to befriend a Muslim neighbor, invite an Asian international student to their home or prepare for a short-term mission trip to India." (Paul Borthwick, senior consultant, Development Associates International, author of Great Commission, Great Compassion)<br><br>"Grounded in years of missions experience and biblical teaching, Rawson provides a powerful primer on understanding culture, developing crosscultural relationships, and communicating across cultures. A must-read for anyone hoping to serve and to share the gospel in crosscultural contexts!" (Tom Lin, vice president, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, director of Urbana)<br><br>"We live in a world of neighborhoods, businesses, schools and churches that are increasingly diverse. To communicate a contagious faith in Jesus requires that we engage with those who are of very different cultures and worldviews. Katie Rawson provides a clear path through the many complex issues that we inevitably face while doing so. The book is filled with concrete and helpful tips on what to do and say in a wide variety of situations, but best of all, it is written with a deep sense of expectation of and dependence on the guidance of the Holy Spirit&#x2015;the master of crosscultural communication." (Charles Davis, former director of TEAM, author of Making Disciples Across Cultures)<br><br>"Katie Rawson's book confronts every believer with a heart for crosscultural ministry and every current or prospective message bearer (missionary) with the question of what we are truly producing in those we minister among. Are we really producing disciples who have had their previous worldview transformed by the values of Jesus and the kingdom of God? How often in crosscultural ministry is this not the case. This problem can relate to the great strongholds and spiritual oppression that keep these precious people bound in darkness. Katie deals with these issues head-on and with lots of wisdom and personal experience. I encourage every believer with a heart to see Jesus' transforming power across every culture to read this book. I wholeheartedly recommend it." (Ryan Shaw, international lead facilitator, Student Volunteer Movement 2, author, Spiritual Equipping for Mission)<br><br>"<em>Crossing Cultures with Jesus</em> fills a gap in the literature for international student ministry (ISM). Although numerous small publications address specific needs within ISM, Rawson gives us a much more comprehensive work that finds the heart of ISM in the heart of God. Sound biblical teaching undergirds each chapter, enhanced by appropriate principles from missions and cultural anthropology. Stories from ISM&#x2015;many of which are from the author's own experience&#x2015;provide examples of how the principles can be applied in multicultural contexts. Chapters include sections for both personal reflection and group discussion. <em>Crossing Cultures with Jesus</em> will be a valuable resource for ISM staff members and interns. In addition, this book can provide church missions personnel with a strong rationale for supporting ISM in their own communities." (Carmen J. Bryant, ISM specialist, Campus Ambassadors, adjunct professor, Multnomah University)<br><br>"A thorough and engaging tool, useful for anyone wanting to understand the gospel and crossing cultures. This book dives deep into Scripture and illustrates sophisticated academic topics with real-life stories. Practical, insightful and very helpful. This book was written with transformation of the heart and transformation of ministry in mind." (Nikki Toyama-Szeto, IJM Institute, coauthor of More than Serving Tea and God of Justice: The IJM Institute Global Church Curriculum)<br><br>"These are interesting times for we Christians who live in an increasingly multicultural country. On the one hand, it can be tempting to share the good news of Jesus with great zeal but little crosscultural savvy. On the other hand, it can be tempting to relate crossculturally with great sensitivity and grace but never get around to sharing the good news. In <em>Crossing Cultures with Jesus</em> Katie J. Rawson shows us that it is possible to share the good news of Jesus and still be gracious and sensitive as we relate crossculturally. This is such an important book for the times we live in. <em>Crossing Cultures with Jesus</em> is thoughtful, biblical and thoroughly practical." (Don Everts, author of Go and Do, coauthor of I Once Was Lost)<br><br>"These are exciting days. God is allowing people from all cultures to travel around the world. Believers now have opportunities to share Jesus with people from places we will never travel to. This book equips us through multiple true stories so that we will be much more effective in sharing Jesus. Each chapter also has excellent discussion questions." (Christine Dillon, crosscultural evangelist and storyteller, author, Telling the Gospel Through Story)<br><br>"Rawson helps us move across cultures in God's love. This book is very practical, with many real-life examples. Small groups will appreciate the helpful discussion questions at the end of each chapter. Rawson's ideas have been tested and refined through more than thirty years of real ministry experience. Please enjoy this thorough and practical guide to crosscultural ministry." (Doug Schaupp, associate national director of evangelism, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, coauthor of I Once Was Lost and Being White)<br><br>"This is a one-of-a-kind and much-awaited book in the field of cross-cultural evangelism. With thoroughness and insights from Scripture, scholars and stories, Rawson gives us a strong case that in Jesus, we have the model of the ultimate culture-crosser. This book combines her love for Jesus, dependence on the Holy Spirit, evangelistic zeal, academic credentials, many years of experience in international student ministry, devotion to prayer and commitment to sound Bible study. It is a must-read guide for anyone desiring to share Jesus across cultures."

Some critics condemned the playwright, others praised him. In susequent years his work has had a profound impact on a generation of young Asian American writers. With the publication of this volume, the plays can now be read and debated and enjoyed by a larger audience.</p><p>Book of Plays: The Year of the Dragon barges through the comfortable stereotypes of the Asian American-the quiet, hardworking contented character who keeps to himself, rarely bothering the white community. It is not an &#39;easy&#39; play. The language is frequently strong, and the bitterness, even when wrapped in some very funny comedy, is unrelenting... But as a portrait of an Asian American&#39;s furious struggle for identity, the play is a searing statement, a powerful cry.&#39;LIT</p><h2>Still Pumped from Using The Mouse (Dilbert Books (Paperback Andrews McMeel))</h2><p>For the more than 50 million readers who regularly enjoy Dilbert in over 2,000 newspapers worldwide, Scott Adams&#39;s take on the working world is outrageously fresh, farcical, and far-reaching.

Adams has published twenty-three books with more than ten million copies in print.An insider&#39;s look into the business office finds Dilbert and cohorts dealing and dueling with the gadgets and grievances of technology and providing a display of perplexing electronics power.</p><h2>Edward Gorey: His Book Cover Art and Design</h2><p>The master creator of finely crosshatched illustrations and sinisterly amusing tales, Edward Gorey (American, 1925 2000) got his start in publishing by designing book covers for such New York houses as Doubleday, Grosset &amp; Dunlap, Vintage Books, and later Random House. Today, his prodigious output of hundreds of dust jackets and paperback covers evidences his distinctive flair for design and his extraordinary ability to portray the essence of the books that came his way. Edward Gorey: His Book Cover Art &amp; Design features a broad selection of his work, created from 1953 to 2000. <p> In his essay, Steven Heller offers an insightful overview of Gorey's book cover art and design. He writes, "Successful cover design requires the expertise of an artist, typographer, poster designer, and logo maker. Many book design specialists were incapable of designing a cover or jacket with the same Gorey aplomb, even if they tried."</p></p><p></p><h2>God and His Image: An Outline of Biblical Theology</h2><p><p>Fr. Dominique Barthï¿½lemy, O.P. was an internationally recognized expert on Old Testament studies and a member of the Pontifical Biblical Commission. In this highly acclaimed work he dispenses with the technical language of exegesis and linguistics and speaks more simply and directly&#x2015;as a priest, a teacher, a believer &#x2015;about the heart of the Biblical message. This work is a beautiful and inspiring introduction to the spiritual teaching of the Old Testament, a book that will greatly help believers to hear the renewing and rejuvenating Word of God with deepened understanding and appreciation.</p><p>This is a book about the close relationship between God and man. It is about the long history of God's love for man and the struggles that man has had in remaining faithful to God and keeping intact the divine image in which he was created. Barthï¿½lemy's purpose here is to present what God says about himself and about those made in his image (man) in the inspired texts of Scripture. Fr. Barthï¿½lemy helps us see the profound unity between the Old and New Testaments, and he shows how the Old Testament is a necessary and valuable light for men of faith today.</p><p>This powerful work by an acclaimed Biblical and spiritual writer will enkindle the heart and enlighten the mind of modern man to see who God really is and who we truly are in God's eyes, helping us to understand the full extent of our deep need for God and knowledge of our ultimate purpose in life.</p></p><p></p><h2>Fretboard Logic II - Chords, Scales and Arpeggios Complete</h2><p>Volume II of the series teaches the tonal elements of music in a way that eliminates the typical guesswork and rote memorization. Guesswork refers to the process of deciding by trial and error which of several duplicates is the right note for the right finger. Rote memorization refers to learning chords, etc., by put-this-finger-here, that-finger-there then rinse and repeat a million more times - dots on graphs approach. Instead of the cut and try or brute force approach, Volume II teaches you to combine the fretboard forms of Volume I with each tone groups unique music formula. This way a guitarist learns to build all the different types of chords, scales and arpeggios. The result is a method to access and retain huge amounts of music material with a minimum of effort. This approach also shaves years off the typical learning curve for guitar players.</p><p>Volume II is the first method of its kind ever developed. Never before has the serious guitarist been able to acquire and retain such a wide range of tonal materials with so little effort.When it came to learning chords and scales, my own teachers were divided into two camps. The first camp said Just memorize all this and then Ill show you what to do with it and then theyd hand me a huge chord book or a huge scale book and so on. The second, presumably more academic camp felt that all tone groups had to be reduced to individual notes in order to be learned, which was a lot of extra work. But even after all that, when youd go to find the notes on the fretboard, youd have to guess which string to look for each note on and if they were out of reach, youd have to start over. That didnt even take into account the added irregularity of the 2nd and 3rd string pair. It wasnt until years later that I realized neither camp had the slightest idea about the guitars pattern organization, and they were just parroting what theyd been taught without having bothered to think it through.</p><h2>The Riders</h2><p>An exploration of marriage and the rich relationship that can exist between father and daughter, <i>The Riders</i> is a gorgeously wrought novel from the award-winning author Tim Winton.<br><br>After traveling through Europe for two years, Scully and his wife Jennifer wind up in Ireland, and on a mystical whim of Jennifer's, buy an old farmhouse which stands in the shadow of a castle.

I&#x2019;m desperate for you, man. You&#x2019;ve got to give it to me. Right here. Right now. I need you like I&#x2019;ve never needed you before.&#x201d;</p> <p>In the hallway of the Caronese Winter Palace, Maris froze as he heard the deeply masculine, pleading Andarion accent through the door speaking with his male best friend.</p> <p><i>No&nbsp;&#x2026; </i></p> <p>There was no way the two of them were talking about what it sounded like. Unlike him, they were both straight. He knew that for a fact, and yet, as they continued arguing, it definitely sounded like two lovers squabbling.</p> <p>Completely confounded, Maris met Nykyrian&#x2019;s stunned expression as the royal prince caught up to him in the hallway outside Darling&#x2019;s office. Tall, blond, and lethal, Nykyrian&#x2014;or Nemesis, as he was better known&#x2014;was a former League assassin who had an intensity that let you know in an instant he saw you first as a target and then, only if you were lucky, a sentient creature he might not want to kill.</p> <p>Being half Andarion, Nykyrian&#x2019;s hearing was even more astute than Maris&#x2019;s. Not that anyone needed supersonic hearing to miss this exchange. Their decibel level carried quite plainly through the heavy door of the emperor&#x2019;s office.</p> <p>And how Darling&#x2019;s two imperial guards remained stone-faced while it went on was a testament to their training.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hell. No. Hauk,&#x201d; Darling snapped, enunciating each word with rage. &#x201c;As much as I love and owe you, I&#x2019;m not doing <i>that</i> for you. <i>Ever</i>. Forget it.&#x2026; And even if we did, <i>you</i> couldn&#x2019;t handle it. Besides, you&#x2019;ve never wanted it before. Not like this, and definitely not from <i>me</i>.&#x201d;</p> <p>Maris&#x2019;s jaw dropped in synchronicity with Nykyrian&#x2019;s.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ah, come on, Darling.&#x201d; Hauk continued to plead in a tender, needful tone Maris had never heard him use before. &#x201c;After everything I&#x2019;ve done over the years to protect your sorry ass, I can&#x2019;t believe you won&#x2019;t share it with me. Don&#x2019;t be like this. This isn&#x2019;t a want. It&#x2019;s a need. A major one. If you really loved me, you&#x2019;d do this for me without question. Now give it to me! Please!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No! Not if we were the last two beings in the universe. Not even if you were down on your knees in front of me, buck naked and begging me for it.&#x201d;</p> <p>His expression horrified, Nykyrian opened the door to show Darling and Hauk standing on opposite sides of Darling&#x2019;s desk, glaring at each other as if they were about to come to blows.</p> <p>With his short red hair brushed back from his face and his royal harone hanging to his left shoulder, Darling was dressed in dark blue and maroon emperor robes while Hauk was swathed in a red-tinged black blast-resistant Sentella battlesuit that hugged every inch of his huge, well-muscled body. His black hair fell to his shoulders in small, extremely attractive braids that were common for the warriors on his home planet to designate them as the fiercest of their breed. The stark darkness of his warrior&#x2019;s uniform made his skin glow a rich tawny-caramel that would make anyone&#x2019;s mouth water for a taste.</p> <p>Obviously annoyed, Hauk turned toward them and pinned them with his red-and-white Andarion eyes.</p> <p>Even though Nykyrian shared many Andarion traits with Hauk, such as fangs, sensitive hearing, and extreme height, he had green human eyes. Ones that showed no fear as he locked gazes with Hauk. &#x201c;Thank the gods you&#x2019;re both still dressed and not entwined naked on the floor.&#x2026; Now tell me, what exactly are we interrupting?&#x201d;</p> <p>Hauk scowled at the comment and question as if replaying their exchange in his head while Darling burst into laughter.</p> <p>&#x201c;Damn, Nyk&nbsp;&#x2026; my wife&#x2019;s not <i>that</i> pregnant.&#x201d; Darling&#x2019;s tone was filled with utter indignation.</p> <p>Maris scoffed. &#x201c;Oh please, honey. Zarya&#x2019;s so pregnant, one good sneeze could launch your son into this world in a matter of seconds.&#x201d;</p> <p>Darling gave him a droll stare, but he knew it was true. Due any minute now, the poor girl was almost as huge as a shuttle craft.</p> <p>And crankier than a Gondarion were-beast.</p> <p>Moving closer to Hauk, Nykyrian looked back and forth between them. &#x201c;And neither of you has answered my question. What had the two of you shouting lewd come-ons at each other?&#x201d;</p> <p>Now it was Maris&#x2019;s turn to burst into laughter, as a smile toyed at the edges of Nykyrian&#x2019;s lips.</p> <p>With a nonchalance Maris knew he didn&#x2019;t feel, Darling crossed his arms over his chest. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s something truly horrific, Nyk. We&#x2019;re talking the stuff of <i>haunting</i> nightmares.&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>Maris arched a brow at that dire statement. Given what each of them had survived, he could only imagine what would make the intrepid Andarion warrior flinch.</p> <p>Darling jerked his chin toward Hauk. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s facing six weeks alone with a creature so terrifying that he&#x2019;s actually in here begging me for explosive devices that can temporarily maim him so that he won&#x2019;t have to go near it.&#x201d;</p> <p>The gape returned to Nykyrian as he faced Hauk. &#x201c;Seriously? It&#x2019;s a child, Hauk, not a rabid animal you&#x2019;re about to be caged with.&#x201d;</p> <p>Hauk scoffed at his nonchalance. &#x201c;I beg to differ, and need I remind you how <i>you</i> felt the first time you learned you had a half-grown daughter and a baby on the way? As I recall, you weren&#x2019;t exactly let&#x2019;s-all-go-to-the-park-and-have-fun, buddy. But six kids later, you&#x2019;re fine with it all, while I&#x2019;m sick to my stomach at the prospect. What do you feed them? What if he has to go to the bathroom? Huh? What do I do then?&#x201d;</p> <p>Darling rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Your nephew&#x2019;s fourteen, Hauk. I promise you, you won&#x2019;t have to burp him or change his nappies.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, how do you know?&#x201d; Hauk scoffed.</p> <p>&#x201c;True, Darling,&#x201d; Nykyrian said drily. &#x201c;We still have to change Hauk&#x2019;s anytime you set off an explosion too close to him.&#x201d;</p> <p>Maris and Darling laughed while Hauk glared viciously at Nykyrian. That alone spoke volumes about Nykyrian&#x2019;s courage.</p> <p>Anyone else who received such a look from Hauk would run screaming for the door.</p> <p>Including Maris.</p> <p>&#x201c;Go ahead,&#x201d; Hauk growled. &#x201c;All of you. Laugh at me. Sure. Why not? But none of you have ever had to survive alone with a child, in the wilderness, for six minutes, never mind six weeks. Endurance is the hardest thing <i>any</i> Andarion goes through. Both the adult <i>and</i> the child.&#x201d;</p> <p>Instantly, Nykyrian sobered as if he had sudden clarity over this uncharacteristic outburst. A deep sadness darkened his green eyes before he looked at Darling, then Maris. &#x201c;Would you two mind giving us the room for a minute?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; Darling stepped out from behind his desk and followed Maris to the door.</p> <p>Hauk visibly cringed at the sound of their exit as he realized what Nykyrian really wanted to talk about. It was something he&#x2019;d been trying to bury for weeks now as this date thundered closer.</p> <p>And it was the last thing he wanted to discuss with anyone.</p> <p>Even Nyk.</p> <p>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t about Darice.&#x2026; I&#x2019;ve known you almost the whole of your life, Dancer, and I&#x2019;ve seen you roll around the floor with my boys, Jayne&#x2019;s kids, and Devyn enough to know that you&#x2019;re not really afraid of children. This is about you and Keris, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p> <p>Hauk turned away from his best friend, unable to face the truth Nykyrian spoke. Out of his small handful of friends, only Nyk knew about his eldest brother, Keris&#x2014;because Nyk, alone, had been in Hauk&#x2019;s life when it&#x2019;d happened. And since the day Keris had died during Hauk&#x2019;s Endurance, Hauk had barely been able to say his brother&#x2019;s name aloud.</p> <p>To anyone.</p> <p>Gods, even now it was enough to bring him to his knees. Every fucking day of his life had been spent with guilt and grief over an unnecessary loss that no one in his family had ever forgiven him for.</p> <p>Especially not himself.</p> <p>And now he was supposed to take Keris&#x2019;s son on the same expedition that had scarred them both for life and cost Keris his.</p> <p>It was so unfair.</p> <p>&#x201c;Darice is the spitting image of his father, did you know that?&#x201d; Hauk whispered. &#x201c;I love my nephew with every part of me, but there are times I can&#x2019;t even bear to look at him. Even their speech inflections are the same.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Nykyrian moved to stand by his side so that they could keep their voices low. &#x201c;I really <i>do</i> know, Hauk. My daughter has some of Aksel&#x2019;s and Arast&#x2019;s mannerisms and expressions. And when she cops their condescending tones and snotty attitudes, it takes every bit of will I possess not to put her through a wall. It&#x2019;s not her fault she takes after them. They were in her life longer than I&#x2019;ve been. Hell, she doesn&#x2019;t even know she does it. But even so, it feels like they&#x2019;re back from the grave to torment me.&#x201d;</p> <p>Flexing his jaw, Hauk winced at the pain in Nykyrian&#x2019;s voice. A pain he understood better than anyone since he&#x2019;d been there to see firsthand what Nyk&#x2019;s adoptive brothers had done to him. It was a hell no child should ever endure.</p> <p>And he&#x2019;d seen the exact tones and expressions Thia used that were identical to those of her long-dead stepfather and uncle. It had to be grueling for Nyk to deal with that all over again.</p> <p>Fate was a bitch, and that whore mocked them both daily.</p> <p>His anger mounting, he met Nykyrian&#x2019;s gaze. For once, he didn&#x2019;t see the war-hardened face of an assassin wingman who&#x2019;d stood by his side for countless battles and protected his ass like a true blood brother. He saw the horrifically scarred face of the boy Nyk had been when they&#x2019;d first met as children.</p> <p>A boy who&#x2019;d once saved Hauk&#x2019;s life while everyone else had stood back to watch him burn.</p> <p>Literally.</p> <p>There was a lot to be said for a friendship that spanned double-digit years. But right now, it seriously rankled him that Nyk knew what was really bothering him.</p> <p>And it made him wonder something about his friend that he hadn&#x2019;t considered before. &#x201c;Is that why you didn&#x2019;t take Thia on her Endurance?&#x201d;</p> <p>Nykyrian shook his head. &#x201c;Thia&#x2019;s only a quarter Andarion, and by the time her mother got around to telling me I had a daughter, Thia was past the age of it.&#x201d;</p> <p>Not to mention, the first two years of their living together, Nykyrian had been going through extensive operations and physical therapy for the almost fatal injuries Aksel had given him the day Nyk had finally put the bastard in his grave. Even now, eight years later, Nykyrian still walked with a pronounced limp, and only had limited use of his right hand and arm.</p> <p>Hauk ground his teeth as other painful childhood memories surged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a <i>stupid</i> tradition. It chafes my ass that I have to do this.&#x201d;</p> <p>Nykyrian snorted at his outburst. &#x201c;Everything chafes your ass, my brother.&#x201d;</p> <p>True, but still&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>Hauk let out an elongated growl. Even if his father hadn&#x2019;t lost his legs in battle or been too disabled to be exposed to the harsh conditions of Endurance, his father was too old to do it now. And his brother Fain had been disinherited even before Hauk had gone through his. There was no other male in their family lineage who could take Darice.</p> <p>Like it or not, Hauk was honor bound and family obligated to see this through.</p> <p>But honestly, he&#x2019;d rather sacrifice a testicle than go. Every time Darice looked at him, he saw the accusation and anger in his nephew that blamed him for Keris&#x2019;s death.</p> <p>Nykyrian stepped away from him. &#x201c;Have you mentioned to your father the staggering bounties on your head? Or that you have enough assassins after you that you could start your own army?&#x201d;</p> <p>Hauk made a rude noise at the mere suggestion. &#x201c;My father&#x2019;s an Andarion war hero. Do you really think that would deter him?&#x201d; He&#x2019;d think Hauk weak and cowardly for even mentioning it.</p> <p>Nykyrian sighed. &#x201c;No. He&#x2019;d say it adds to the challenge of it all.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Exactly. You&#x2019;ve no idea how many times I&#x2019;ve cursed my parents for their blind adherence to the old ways.&#x201d;</p> <p>Nykyrian clapped a hand on Hauk&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Again, brother, I do know. You never bitch about it, but I can read your expressions better than your words.&#x201d; He went to pour them both a shot of Tondarion Fire&#x2014;a potent alcohol&#x2014;from the small table beside Darling&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;You know, you could take Thia with you as a distraction. It might help you get through this.&#x201d;</p> <p>A taunting grin spread across his lips as he took the shot glass from Nykyrian&#x2019;s gloved hand. &#x201c;You would really turn your beautiful daughter loose, alone with two Andarion males, for six weeks?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Never. But I would trust her with my family.&#x201d;</p> <p>And that they definitely were.</p> <p>Hauk knocked back the drink in one gulp and pinned his gaze on Nyk. &#x201c;And I can read you as well as you read me. Why do you want her gone so badly?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t. But&#x2026;&#x201d; Nyk let his words trail off as he gulped his own drink then poured another. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s been acting out since Zarina was born. It&#x2019;s almost like she thinks that now that we have another daughter, she&#x2019;s not wanted anymore. Truthfully, I don&#x2019;t know what to do. She stays out all night. Drags home the kind of dregs we&#x2019;re paid to kill, and then dares me to lay a hand on them.&#x201d; He growled low in his throat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a trained assassin, Hauk, and they&#x2019;re dating my precious little girl. Putting body parts on her&nbsp;&#x2026; and that&#x2019;s just their hands, that I know of. Any idea how hard it is for me to let them leave my house upright and in one piece? She won&#x2019;t even let me give them a damn bloody nose. Gah, it&#x2019;s more than I can bear.&#x201d;</p> <p>He scoffed at Nykyrian&#x2019;s irritation. &#x201c;And now you know why your father-in-law had you shot&nbsp;&#x2026; multiple times.&#x201d;</p> <p>Nykyrian glared at him. &#x201c;I curse you, Hauk&nbsp;&#x2026; may you live to raise a beautiful daughter. And I hope you have more than one, you son of a bitch.&#x201d; He slung his shot back even faster than Hauk had. &#x201c;Thia&#x2019;s been way too serious with this latest <i>veriton</i>. I&#x2019;m thinking if she&#x2019;s gone for six weeks, he&#x2019;ll get bored and move on to someone safer.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If he doesn&#x2019;t?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I still have a few places left to hide bodies no one knows about.&#x201d;</p> <p>Hauk laughed then sobered as he seriously considered the offer. In all honesty, Thia would be a welcome distraction. While she didn&#x2019;t care for roughing it, she could cook better than either of them. And the additional body might keep the memories of Keris at bay. It wouldn&#x2019;t be the same as it&#x2019;d been when he and his brother had gone alone to Oksana for Endurance.</p> <p>Best of all, Thia actually liked him.</p> <p>He inclined his head to Nykyrian. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be more than happy to spend a few weeks with my first love. Besides, as an Andarion princess, she needs to have this on her rï¿½sumï¿½.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t let her think for one instant that I&#x2019;m doing this to get rid of her.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Trust me, I know. You&#x2019;re doing this to get rid of her boyfriend.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d; Nykyrian headed to the door to readmit Darling to his office.</p> <p>Before he could open it, Hauk pulled him to a stop. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;</p> <p>Nykyrian held his hand up to him. <i>&#x201c;Estra, mi dreystin.&#x201d;</i></p> <p>Taking his proffered hand, Hauk pulled him into a rare familial hug and repeated the Andarion words of loyalty that literally translated to <i>anytime, my brother.</i> But the Andarion connotation was much deeper than that. It was an oath of absolute kinship. One that bound them closer than blood.</p> <p>No Andarion said those words lightly. It meant that they would die back-to-back, fighting any and all attackers.</p> <p>And it was one they&#x2019;d both proven to each other repeatedly.</p> <p>Nykyrian stepped away from him. &#x201c;Just remember, Hauk, I know Andarion urges, and if any male, including you, lays a finger on my girl while she&#x2019;s in your custody, I will cut you into pieces and feast on your entrails.&#x201d;</p> <p>Laughing, Hauk knew Nykyrian meant <i>those</i> words most of all.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright ï¿½ 2014 by Sherrilyn...</p></p><h2>Way to Water: A Theopoetics Primer</h2><p>Way to Water has two primary intentions: to trace the development of the nascent field of theological inquiry known as theopoetics and to make an argument that theopoetics provides both theological and practical resources for contemporary people of faith who seek to maintain a confessional Christian life that is also intellectually critical. Beginning with the work of Stanley Hopper in the late 1960s, and addressing the early scholarship of key theopoetics authors like Rubem Alves and Amos Wilder, this text explores how theopoetics was originally developed as a response to the American death-of-God movement, and has since grown into a method for engaging in theological thought in a way that more fully honors embodiment and aesthetic dimensions of human experience. Most of the extant literature in the field is addressed to allow for a cumulative and comprehensive articulation of the nature and function of theopoetics. The text includes an exploration of how theopoetic insights might aid in the development of tangible church practices, and concludes with a series of theopoetic reflections.</p><p>L. Callid Keefe-Perry is a member of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and travels in the ministry within and beyond that denomination. He is the founder of Theopoetics.net and an editor of the journal Theopoetics, as well as a cohost on the podcast Homebrewed Christianity.''Theopoetics is so elusive that it seems an unlikely subject for a primer. Yet Callid Keefe-Perry has given us just that, and beautifully. In an engagingly conversational style, he takes us through the emergence and development of this strange mode of theological speech. He then invitingly demonstrates how practical these abstractions can really be for pastoral and liturgical work. The text is persuasive, committed yet without dogmatism, and amazingly accessible--a great introduction for anyone.''<br>--Karmen MacKendrick, Le Moyne College, Syracuse, NY<br><br>''With the emergence of theopoetics in the church and society, a primer on the genre is most welcome. Yet more than a primer, Keefe-Perry offers his own constructive work as one of the leading writers in this artful mode of spiritual and intellectual reflection.

Steven Watson follows their diverse lives from childhood through their Factory years. He shows how this ever-changing mix of artists and poets, musicians and filmmakers, drag queens, society figures, and fashion models, all interacted at the Factory to create more than 500 films, the Velvet Underground, paintings and sculpture, and thousands of photographs. <br><br>Between 1961 and 1964 Warhol produced his most iconic art: the Flower paintings, the Marilyns, the Campbell&#x2019;s Soup Can paintings, and the Brillo Boxes. But it was his films&#x2014;Sleep, Kiss, Empire, The Chelsea Girls, and Vinyl&#x2014;that constituted his most prolific output in the mid-1960s, and with this book Watson points up the important and little-known interaction of the Factory with the New York avant-garde film world. Watson sets his story in the context of the revolutionary milieu of 1960s New York: the opening of Paul Young&#x2019;s Paraphernalia, Truman Capote&#x2019;s Black and White Ball, Max&#x2019;s Kansas City, and the Beautiful People Party at the Factory, among many other events. <br><br>Interspersed throughout are Watson&#x2019;s trademark sociogram, more than 130 black-and-white photographs&#x2014;some never before seen&#x2014;and many sidebars of quotes and slang that help define the Warholian world. With <i>Factory Made,</i> Watson has focused on a moment that transformed the art and style of a generation.</p><p>&#x201c;Steven Watson has written the best imaginable book on the Sixties of Andy Warhol&#x2019;s Silver Factory, the Exploding Plastic Inevitable, and the appropriation by mainstream culture of the underground avant-garde. Based on the testimony of those who were part of it, those who were not there can now know exactly what it was like, without having to pay the price of having to live through it. And since the end of the Silver Factory coincides with the near-fatal attempt on Warhol&#x2019;s life in 1968, the book has the narrative drive of an unfolding tragedy. The research is impeccable, the spirit of the book is open and sympathetic, and the writing is as witty as it is clear. A marvelous achievement.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Arthur C. Danto<br><br>&#x201c;Factory Made, an encyclopedic act of cultural memory, is as wide-angled, as sympathetic, as polyphonic, and as entertaining an account of Warhol&#x2019;s 1960s as we&#x2019;re likely to get. Watson&#x2019;s emphasis on collaborative artistic practices offers an eye-opening antidote to the usual Andy-centered approach.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Wayne Koestenbaum<br><br>&#x201c;Although Andy Warhol&#x2019;s famous movies are among the most boring ever made, this book about them is endlessly fascinating.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;John Richardson<br><br>&#x201c;Steven Watson's history of Andy Warhol&#x2019;s Silver Factory years is a riveting mosaic that captures a moment in the New York art world when cultural change was accelerating at the speed of light. The book sustains an atmosphere of tremendous suspense as, one after another, Warhol&#x2019;s &#x2018;superstars&#x2019; are born, flash, and burn out, and the wild party peopled with speed freaks, drag queens, and exhibitionists spins out of control. In casting a wide cultural net this entertaining history encompasses Pop Art, experimental film, and the birth of the Play-House of the Ridiculous, connecting these movements and making sense of it all in a way that no other book has done. Factory Made is a masterly achievement.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Stephen HoldenSteven Watson is a cultural historian and documentary filmmaker.

A long rope connects the two and gets tangled in the legs of the passersby, who grumble and gripe, and the boy mutters "Sorry, sorry" again and again. In between mumbled sorries he yells "Stop! Halt!"&#x2014;and to his shame a "Whoa-ah!" escapes from his lips. And the dog keeps running.<br><br>It flies on, crossing busy streets, running red lights. Its golden coat disappears before the boy's very eyes and reappears between people's legs, like a secret code. "Slower!" the boy yells, and thinks that if only he knew the dog's name, he could call it and perhaps the dog would stop, or at least slow down. But deep in his heart he knows the dog would keep running, even then. Even if the rope chokes its neck, it'll run until it gets where it's galloping to&#x2014;and don't I wish we were already there and I was rid of him!<br><br>All this is happening at a bad time. Assaf, the boy, continues to run ahead while his thoughts remain tangled far behind him. He doesn't want to think them, he needs to concentrate completely on his race after the dog, but he feels them clanging behind him like tin cans. His parents' trip&#x2014;that's one can. They're flying over the ocean right now, flying for the first time in their lives&#x2014;why, why did they have to leave so suddenly, anyway? His older sister&#x2014;there's another can&#x2014;and he's simply afraid to think about that one, only trouble can come of it. More cans, little ones and big ones, are clanging, they bang against each other in his mind&#x2014;and at the end of the string drags one that's been following him for two weeks now, and the tinny noise is driving him out of his mind, insisting, shrilly, that he has to fall madly in love with Dafi now&#x2014;because how long are you going to try to put it off? And Assaf knows he has to stop for a minute, has to call these maddening tin followers to order, but the dog has other plans.<br><br>Assaf sighs&#x2014;"Hell!"&#x2014;because only a minute before the door opened and he was called in to see the dog, he was so close to identifying the part of himself in which he could fall in love with her, with Dafi. He could actually, finally, feel that spot in himself; he could feel himself suppressing it, refusing it in the depths of his stomach, where a slow, silent voice kept whispering. She's not for you, Dafi, she spends all her time looking for ways to sting and mock everyone, especially you: why do you need to keep up this stupid show, night after night? Then, when he had almost succeeded in silencing that quarrelsome voice, the door of the room in which he had been sitting every day for the last week, from eight to four, opened. There stood Avraham Danokh, skinny and dark and bitter, the assistant manager of the City Sanitation Department. (He was sort of a friend of his father's and got Assaf the job for August.) Danokh told him to get off his ass and come down to the kennels with him, now, because there was finally work for him to do.<br><br>Danokh paced the room and started explaining something about a dog. Assaf didn't listen. It usually took him a few seconds to transfer his attention from one situation to another. Now he was dragging after Danokh along the corridors of City Hall, past people who came to pay their bills or their taxes or snitch on the neighbors who built a porch without a license. Following Danokh down the fire stairs, then into the courtyard in back, he tried to decide whether he had already managed to defeat his own last stand against Dafi, whether he knew yet how he would respond today when Roi told him to quit stalling and start acting like a man. Already, in the distance, Assaf heard one strong, persistent bark and wondered why it sounded like that: usually the dogs all barked together&#x2014;sometimes their chorus would disturb his daydreams on the third floor&#x2014;and now only one was barking. Danokh opened a chain-link gate and, turning to tell Assaf something he couldn't make out over the barks, opened the other gate, and, with a flick of his hand, motioned Assaf down the narrow walkway between the cages.<br><br>The sound was unmistakable. It was impossible to think that Danokh had brought Assaf down here for just one dog; eight or nine were penned in separate cages. But only one dog was animated; it was as if it had absorbed the others into its own body, leaving them silent and a bit stunned. The dog wasn't very big, but it was full of strength and savagery and, mainly, despair. Assaf had never seen such despair in a dog; it threw itself against the chain links of its cage again and again, making the entire row shake and rattle&#x2014;then it would produce a horrifying high wail, a strange cross between a whine and a roar. The other dogs stood, or lay down, watching in silence, in amazement, even respect. Assaf had the strange feeling that if he ever saw a human being behave that way, he would feel compelled to rush up and offer his help&#x2014;or else leave, so the person could be alone with his sorrow.<br><br>In the pauses between barks and slams against the cage, Danokh spoke quietly and quickly: one of the inspectors had found the dog the day before yesterday, running through the center of town near Tziyyon Square. At first the vet thought it was in the early stage of rabies, but there were no further signs of disease: apart from the dirt and a few minor injuries, the dog was in perfect health. Assaf noticed that Danokh spoke out of the corner of his mouth, as if he were trying to keep the dog from knowing it was being talked about. "He's been like that for forty-eight hours now," Danokh whispered, "and still not out of batteries. Some animal, huh?" he added, stretching nervously as the dog stared at him. "It's not just a street dog." "But whose is it?" Assaf asked, stepping back as the dog threw itself against the metal mesh, rocking the cage. "That's it, exactly," Danokh responded nasally, scratching his head, "that's what <i>you</i> have to find out." "Me? How me?" Assaf quavered. "Where will I find him?" Danokh said that as soon as this kalb&#x2014;he called it a <i>kalb</i>, using Arabic&#x2014;calms down a little, we'll ask him. Assaf looked at him, puzzled, and Danokh said, "We'll simply do what we always do in such cases: we tie a rope to the dog and let it walk for a while, an hour or two, and it will lead you itself, straight and steady, to its owner."<br><br>Assaf thought he was joking&#x2014;who had ever heard of such a thing? But Danokh took a folded piece of paper out of his shirt pocket and said it was very important, before he gave the dog back, for the owners to sign the form. Form 76. Put it in your pocket&#x2014;and don't lose it (because, to tell the truth, you seem a little out to lunch). And most important, you have to explain to the esteemed master of this dog that a fine is included. A settlement of one hundred and fifty shekels or a trial&#x2014;and he'd better pay up. First of all, he neglected to watch his dog, and maybe that will teach him a lesson to be more careful next time, and second, as a <i>mi</i>nimal compensation (Danokh enjoyed sucking, mockingly, on every syllable) for the headache and hassle he had caused City Hall, not to mention the waste of time of such su<i>perb</i> human resources! With that, he tapped Assaf on the shoulder a little too hard and said that after he found the dog's owners, he could return to his room in the Water Department and continue to scratch his head at the taxpayers' expense until the end of his summer vacation.<br><br>"But how am I . . ." Assaf objected. "Look at it . . . It's like, crazy . . . "<br><br>But then it happened: the dog heard Assaf's voice and stood still. It stopped running back and forth in the cage, approached the wire mesh, and looked at Assaf. Its ribs were still heaving, but it moved more slowly. Its eyes were dark and seemed to focus intensely on him. It cocked its head to the side, as if to get a better look at him, and Assaf thought that the dog was about to open its mouth right then and say in a completely human voice, Oh yeah? You're not exactly a model of sanity yourself.<br><br>It lay on its stomach, the dog; it lowered its head, and its front legs slipped under the metal grid, begging with a digging motion, and out of its throat a new voice emerged, thin and delicate like the cry of a puppy, or a little boy.<br><br>Assaf bent in front of it, from the other side of the cage. He didn't notice what he was doing&#x2014;even Danokh, a hard man, who had arranged the job for Assaf without much enthusiasm, smiled a thin smile when he saw the way Assaf got down on his knees at the blink of an eye. Assaf looked at the dog and spoke quietly to it. "Who do you belong to?" he asked. "What happened to you? Why are you going so crazy?" He spoke slowly, leaving room for answers, not embarrassing the dog by looking into its eyes for too long. He knew&#x2014;his sister Reli's boyfriend had taught him&#x2014;the difference between talking at a dog and talking with a dog. The dog was breathing fast, lying down. Now, for the first time, it seemed tired, exhausted, and it looked a lot smaller than before. The kennels finally fell silent, and the other dogs began moving again, as if coming back to life. Assaf put his finger through one of the holes and touched the dog's head. It didn't move. Assaf scratched its head, the matted, dirty fur. The dog began to whine, frightened, persistent, as if it had to unburden itself to someone right away, as if it could no longer keep silent. Its red tongue trembled. Its eyes grew large and expressive.<br><br>Assaf didn't argue with Danokh after that. Danokh took advantage of the dog's momentary calm: he entered the cage and tied a long rope to the orange collar hidden in its thick fur.<br><br>"Go on, take it," Danokh ordered. "Now it'll go with you like a doll." Danokh jumped b...</p><h2>Joe Brainard: The Nancy Book</h2><p>From 1963 to 1978, Joe Brainard created more than 100 artworks that appropriated the classic comic strip character Nancy and sent her into a variety of astonishing situations. <i>The Nancy Book</i> is the first collection of Brainard's Nancy texts, drawings, collages and paintings, with full page reproductions of more than 50 works, several of which have never been exhibited or published before.</p><p>Joe Brainard (1942-1994) left Tulsa at eighteen for New York City and soon became a part of the thriving downtown art scene and the New York School of poets and painters. Over his career, Brainard created a prodigious body of work, distinguished by its breadth, originality, and rare alchemy of sensuality and precision, sophistication and sweetness. Admired for his writing as well as his visual art, Brainard wrote the legendary and beloved memoir I REMEMBER, which was hailed as &#34;a masterpiece&#34; by Paul Auster and inspired George Perec&#39;s Je me souviens. Brainard&#39;s drawings, assemblages, collages, and paintings are in private and museum collections, including those of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of America Art, and a major travelling retrospective was organized by the Berkeley Art Museum in 2001 and included a stop at MOMA P.S 1.Brainard (1942&#x2013;94) arrived in New York a few years after the pop-art movement brought comics imagery onto the high-art scene. Thus, his comics-appropriation at first blush seems Johnny-come-lately. But he was using comics differently from how the famous pop artists did, not for aesthetic philosophizing but for self-exploration. Brainard was gay, and he often placed the little girl star of Ernie Bushmiller&#x2019;s graphically bare-bones comic strip Nancy, an embodiment of innocence nonpareil, in graphic heterosexual situations for never-specified motives that might have included dissipating the power of what he wasn&#x2019;t attracted by. He also subverted high-art seriousness and cultural solemnity with Nancy by placing her smiling-bulb face on, say, all the nudes descending a staircase in Duchamp&#x2019;s cubist icon,&nbsp;&nbsp;or in Teddy Roosevelt&#x2019;s niche on Mount Rushmore. He wrote Dadaist &#x201c;stories&#x201d; in which he and Nancy interacted, two of which appear with the 53 Nancy artworks in an album that also attests Brainard&#x2019;s wit and humility. This is hilarious, not&#x2014;however personal&#x2014;self-referential, stuff. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Tidings of Death at Honeychurch Hall</h2><p><p><b>'Just the thing to chase the blues away' </b>M. C.

With his signature mix of intelligence and highly literate snark, he dives headlong into contemporary crises--Hurricane Katrina, the Sudanese civil war--through the lens of a single character whose perspective we get to know intimately. In his new novel, Eggers tackles a modern problem that doesn't always seem like one: our near constant hunger for communication. When Mae Holland takes a job at the Circle, a tech giant with a utopian culture and cultlike following (Eggers didn't call it Schmoogle, but may as well have), she quickly loses sight of her friends, family, and sense of self in favor of professional success and social acceptance. As her Circle star rises, Mae succumbs to the corporate code of full disclosure, eventually agreeing to "go transparent" and let the public watch--and comment on--her every move. "Privacy is theft," decrees the company motto; "Secrets are lies." It's not subtle, but neither were "Harrison Bergeron" and <em>1984</em>, and in its best moments <em>The Circle</em> is equally terrifying. Let's just hope it's not prescient. --<em>Mia Lipman</em>Dave Eggers grew up near Chicago and graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is the founder of McSweeney&#39;s, an independent publishing house in San Francisco that produces books, a quarterly journal of new writing (&#34;McSweeney&#39;s Quarterly Concern&#34;), and a monthly magazine, &#34;The Believer.&#34; McSweeney&#39;s publishes Voice of Witness, a nonprofit book series that uses oral history to illuminate human rights crises around the world. In 2002, he cofounded 826 Valencia, a nonprofit youth writing and tutoring center in San Francisco&#39;s Mission District. Sister centers have since opened in seven other American cities under the umbrella of 826 National, and like-minded centers have opened in Dublin, London, Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Birmingham, Alabama, among other locations.

He studied Engineering Science at Balliol College, Oxford. Following his childhood passion, he entered the fledgling aircraft industry as an aeronautical engineer working to develop airships and, later, airplanes. In his spare time he began writing and he published his first novel, <i>Marazan</i>, in 1926, using the name Nevil Shute to protect his engineering career. In 1931 he married Frances Mary Heaton and they had two daughters. During the Second World War he joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve where he worked on developing secret weapons. After the war he continued to write and settled in Australia where he lived until his death in 1960. His most celebrated novels include <i>Pied Piper</i> (1942), <i>A Town Like Alice</i> (1950), and <i>On the Beach</i> (1957).Chapter One<br><br>There was a layer of cumulus, about seven-tenths, with tops at about five thousand feet as we came to Essenden airport; we broke out of it at two thousand and we were on the circuit downwind, with the aerodrome on our starboard wing. I sat with my eyes glued to the window looking out at Melbourne, because this was my home town and I had been away five years. The hostess touched me on the arm and drew my attention from the scene, and told me to fasten my safety belt. I had not seen the sign light up.<br><br>"Sorry," I said.<br><br>She smiled, and then she said quietly, "Would you like any help down the gangway, sir?"<br><br>I shook my head. "I'll wait till the others are all of. I'm alright if I take my time."<br><br>She nodded and moved on, courteous and efficient. I wondered how she knew that going downstairs was the tricky part; perhaps that was a feature of her training, or perhaps the hostesses on the machine from San Francisco had told her about me at Sydney. I turned back to the window to watch the approach to the runway and the landing, and I remained absorbed in the techniques till the machine came to a standstill at the terminal building and the engines came to rest.<br><br>While the other passengers got off I sat at the window trying to see who was there to meet me. It was likely to be my father. I hadn't given them much notice for I had only telegraphed the time of my arrival from Sydney when I landed there the previous evening and it was barely two o'clock now; moreover they weren't expecting me for another four days and we live a hundred and twenty miles from the airport. The wing hid a good part of the enclosure but I saw nobody I knew. I wondered if I should have to go in to town to the Club and telephone home from there.<br><br>I followed the last passenger down the aisle to the door, and thanked the hostesses as I passed them. I made slow time down the steps but once on the flat I was all right, of course, and walked over to the enclosure. It was Harry Drew, our foreman, come to meet me. It was a warm, summery spring day and Harry was very smart. He is a man about forty years old, with dark, curly hair and a youthful figure. He was wearing an opulent-looking American shirt without a jacket on that warm day, a brown shirt buttoned to the neck and worn without a tie; his brown-green grazier's trousers were clean and newly creased and held up with a brand new embossed belt with a large, shiny buckle. He caught my eye and half raised his hand in salutation.<br><br>I passed through the gate and he came to meet me. "Morning, Harry," I said. "How are you today?"<br><br>"Good, Mr. Duncan," he replied. "We didn't expect you till Friday." He took the overnight bag from me.<br><br>"I came along a bit quicker than I thought I would," I said.<br><br>He was clearly puzzled, as they all must have been, by my telegram. "Did you come on a different ship?" he asked. "We thought you'd be flying from Fremantle, arriving Saturday morning."<br><br>"I didn't come that way," I said. "I had to stay in London a bit longer. I flew all the way, through New York and San Francisco to Sydney."<br><br>"Come the other way round?"<br><br>"That's right," I said. We passed into the airport building. "How's my mother, Harry? She's not here, is she?"<br><br>"She didn't come," he said. "She gets out most fine days, but sitting in the chair most of the time, you&nbsp; know. She don't go away much now. Three months or more since she went down to Melbourne." He paused by the newspaper stand. "The colonel, he was coming down to meet you, but we had a bit of trouble."<br><br>"What sort of trouble?" I enquired.<br><br>"The house parlourmaid," he said. "Seems like she committed suicide or something. Anyway, she's dead."<br><br>I stared at him. "For God's sake! How did it happen?"<br><br>"I don't really know," he said. "It only happened this morning, and I left about half past ten to get down here to meet you. She took tablets or something, what they give you to make you sleep."<br><br>"She did it last night?"<br><br>"That's right, Mr. Alan."<br><br>"Who found her?"<br><br>"She didn't come down to her work. They get down to the kitchen in the house about six or quarter past and have a cup of tea. When she didn't come down Annie went up to her room about seven."<br><br>"Old Annie found her?"<br><br>"That's right. She was dead. The colonel rang through for me to go up to the house, 'n soon after I got there Dr. Stanley, he arrived. I suppose the colonel telephoned for him. But there wasn't anything he could do; she was dead all right. So then they got on to the police, and just about then your telegram came from Sydney saying you'd be coming in today. The colonel, he couldn't leave home with all that going on to come down here to meet you, so he said to me to take the Jaguar and come instead."<br><br>I stood by the paper stand while the crowd milled around us. It was a muddle and a mess, and I was deeply sorry for my father and mother. My father was over seventy and my mother not much less, and neither of them in the best of health. Too bad that they should have a nuisance of this nature thrust on them.<br><br>"What did she do it for?" I asked. "In trouble with some man?"<br><br>He wrinkled his brows. "I wouldn't think so," he said. "Coombargana's a small place and not so easy to get away from unless you've got a car of your own, which she hadn't. She couldn't have been going with one of the lads at Coombargana and have no one know about it. I wouldn't think it was that."<br><br>"How long had she been with us?"<br><br>"About a year. Maybe a bit longer. English, she was."<br><br>I nodded; she would have been. English or Dutch or German; an Australian house parlourmaid is rare indeed. "Well I wish to God she'd picked another day to it," I remarked. He grinned, and we went to where the motor coaches stand to claim my luggage.</p><h2>Midnight Unbound</h2><p>A lethal Breed warrior is called upon by his brethren in the Order to bodyguard a beautiful young widow he&#x2019;s craved from afar, in this new novella in the "steamy and intense" (Publishers Weekly) Midnight Breed vampire romance series from New York Times and #1 international bestselling author Lara Adrian.

Whether about building a wall or protecting a Christian heritage, the refrain has been constant. And to the surprise of many, a&nbsp;good 80 percent of white evangelicals&nbsp;<i>have</i>&nbsp;believed Trump&#x2014;at least enough to help propel him into the White House.&nbsp;</p><p>Historian John Fea is not surprised, however&#x2014;and in these pages he explains how we have arrived at this unprecedented moment in American politics. An evangelical Christian himself, Fea argues that the embrace of Donald Trump is the logical outcome of a long-standing evangelical approach to public life defined by the politics of fear, the pursuit of worldly power, and a nostalgic longing for an American past.&nbsp;</p>As insightful as it is timely, Fea&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Believe Me&nbsp;</i>challenges Christians to replace fear with hope, the pursuit of power with humility, and nostalgia with history.</p><p><b>John Fea </b>is professor of American history at Messiah College in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.

But he also speaks here as a theologian and an evangelical himself, eloquently pointing toward a better gospel way. This is a call to action for evangelicals to move beyond the politics of fear to become a &#x2018;faithful presence&#x2019; in a changing world.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Michael Wear</b><br> &#x2014; author of<i>&nbsp;Reclaiming Hope: Lessons Learned in the Obama White House about the Future of Faith in America</i><br> &#x201c;In<i>&nbsp;Believe Me</i>&nbsp;John Fea takes evangelicalism seriously, treating it with the honest respect it deserves.

This explosive new book challenges many of the long-held assumptions about blacks, Jews, Germans and Nazis, slavery, and education. Through a series of essays, Sowell presents an in-depth look at key beliefs behind many mistaken and dangerous actions, policies, and trends. He presents eye-opening insights into the development of the ghetto culture--a culture cheered on toward self-destruction by white liberals who consider themselves &#34;friends&#34; of blacks--which is today wrongly seen as a unique black identity, and he reexamines the tragic institution of slavery. The reasons for the venomous hatred of Jews, and other groups like them in countries around the world, are also explored, as are misconceptions of Nazi Germany. Plainly written, powerfully reasoned, and backed with a startling array of documented facts, Black Rednecks and White Liberals takes on the trendy intellectuals of our times as well as such historic interpreters of American life as Alexis de Tocqueville and Frederick Law Olmsted.</p><p><p><b>Thomas Sowell </b>has taught economics at Cornell, UCLA, Amherst, and other academic institutions, and his <i>Basic Economics</i> has been translated into six languages. He is currently a scholar-in-residence at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University. He has been published in both academic journals and such popular media as the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Forbes</i>, and <i>Fortune</i> and writes a syndicated column that appears in newspapers across the country.</p>One of America's foremost black conservative intellectuals returns with this provocative collection of contrarian essays. Hoover Institution Fellow Sowell, author of Ethnic America, argues that "internal" cultural habits of industriousness, thriftiness, family solidarity and reverence for education often play a greater role in the success of ethnic minorities than do civil-rights laws or majority prejudices. The title essay posits a "black redneck" culture inherited from the white redneck culture of the South and characterized by violent machismo, shiftlessness and disdain for schooling. White liberals, gangsta-rap aficionados and others who lionize its ghetto remnants as an authentic black identity, Sowell contends, have their history wrong and help perpetuate cultural pathologies that hold blacks back. Sowell also examines the cultural achievements of such "middleman minorities" as Jews and expatriate Chinese whose frequent persecution, he feels, represents an animus against capitalism. And he defends Western culture itself against charges that it was uniquely culpable for slavery; in fact, he contends, it was uniquely responsible for eradicating slavery. Many of Sowell's arguments-that the 20th-century resegregation of Northern cities was a response to the uncouthness of black rednecks migrating from the South, or that segregated black schools often succeeded by suppressing redneckism with civilized New England puritanism-will arouse controversy, but these vigorously argued essays present a stimulating challenge to the conventional wisdom. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The concision of the root text and its use of elaborate poetic language, rich in metaphor, require extensive explanation, amply supplied here by the commentary of Kangyur Rinpoche. <br> <br>The present volume lays out the teachings of the sutras in gradual stages according to the traditional three levels, or scopes, of spiritual endeavor. It begins with essential teachings on impermanence, karma, and ethics. Then, from the Hinayana standpoint, it describes the essential Buddhist teachings of the four noble truths and the twelve links of dependent arising. Moving on, finally, to the Mahayana perspective, it expounds fully the teachings on bodhichitta and the path of the six paramitas, and gives an unusually detailed exposition of Buddhist vows. <br> <br>The paperback edition includes Jigme Lingpa&#x2019;s root text in verse, which was not included in the hardcover edition.</p><p>Rigdzin Jigme Lingpa (1730&#x2013;1798) was a great master of the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.

But with puzzled passengers reporting stars on the wrong side and growing alarm over the sudden failure of all their radios - and when armed fighters pull alongside to force them to land - the confused pilots discover that Flight 10 is streaking back toward the hyper-volatile Middle East and there is nothing they can do about it. <br><br>With an alphabet soup of federal agencies struggling for answers and messages flying between Washington, and Tel Aviv where the flight began, the growing supposition that Flight 10 may be hijacked is fueled by the presence of a feared and hated former head of state sitting in first class, a man with an extreme Mid East agenda who may somehow be responsible for the Airbus A-330's loss of control. As frantic speculation spreads, the possibility that the unresponsive airliner could be the leading edge of a sophisticated attack on Iran designed to provoke a nuclear response drives increasingly desperate decisions.<br><br> As time and fuel runs low, flying at full throttle toward a hostile border ahead, Captain Jerry Tollefson and First Officer Dan Horneman have to put their personal animosities aside and risk everything to wrest control from the electronic ghost holding them &#x2013; and perhaps the world - on a course to certain disaster.<br><br>And in the "Hole" - as the war room in Tel Aviv is called - the interim Prime Minister of Israel grapples with a horrifying choice in the balance between 300 airborne lives and the probability of nuclear war.</p><p>New York Times Bestselling author John J.

They could have subsisted on easily caught cod, but they chose to capture dangerous and elusive swordfish. This book explains beautifully the prehistory of these people, the evolution of archaeological thinking about them, and the myriad new scientific threads that shed new light on this old culture. Anyone with even a passing interest in New England's deep maritime roots must read this book. In the closing years of the nineteenth century, strange objects began to come out of the ground in Hancock County, Maine. They were quickly recognized as prehistoric artifacts of stone, but they were very unlike the spear tips and other small artifacts collectors gathered from coastal sites as they eroded into the sea. Many were large and finely crafted, some made of beautiful stone from far-off places. Strangest of all, they came from pits filled with a brilliant red powder called red ocher. These were ancient graves clustered into large cemeteries. Local naturalists brought these finds to the attention of a new breed of scientist--archaeologists who were busy developing their new science at the Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnography at Harvard University. They began to visit and to excavate these sites and introduced them to the world in 1893 at Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition. Between then and 1920, other archaeologists became involved, searching for and discovering more than a dozen new cemeteries. Museum collections grew quickly, but so did confusion about what kind of culture could have produced these wonderful objects. Then interest in the so-called Red Paint cemeteries waned as American archaeologists began to broaden their horizons to other continents. The mystery of the Red Paint People was left hanging. A half century later, as Maine archaeology was undergoing a revival, a new generation of archaeologists, armed with the analytical tools of modern science, once again turned their attention to the Red Paint People and reached some surprising conclusions. This book tells the story of the Red Paint People and the archaeologists who have tried to understand them for over a century. Interwoven with that story is one of scientific growth and evolution, as archaeologists have adopted new research models in collaboration with a broad range of natural scientists to flesh out the life story of a remarkable prehistoric culture: the swordfish hunters.

Mined from the hills and the valleys, they rose in testament to man&#x2019;s inherent desire to leave his mark, to build and create.</p><p>Over those two centuries man married the stone with brick, with wood and glass, enlarging, transforming, enhancing to suit the needs, the times, the whims. Throughout, the building on the crossroads watched as the settlement became a town, as more buildings sprang up.</p><p>The dirt road became asphalt; horse and carriage gave way to cars. Fashions flickered by in the blink of an eye. Still it stood, rising on its corner of The Square, an enduring landmark in the cycle of change.</p><p>It knew war, heard the echo of gunfire, the cries of the wounded, the prayers of the fearful. It knew blood and tears, joy and fury. Birth and death.</p><p>It thrived in good times, endured the hard times. It changed hands and purpose, yet the stone walls stood.</p><p>In time, the wood of its graceful double porches began to sag. Glass broke; mortar cracked and crumbled. Some who stopped at the light on the town square might glance over to see pigeons flutter in and out of broken windows and wonder what the old building had been in its day. Then the light turned green, and they drove on.</p><p>Beckett knew.</p><p>He stood on the opposite corner of The Square, thumbs tucked into the pockets of his jeans. Thick with summer, the air held still. With the road empty, he could have crossed Main Street against the light, but he continued to wait. Opaque blue tarps draped the building from roof to street level, curtaining the front of the building. Over the winter it had served to hold the heat in for the crew. Now it helped block the beat of the sun&#x2014;and the view.</p><p>But he knew&#x2014;how it looked at that moment, and how it would look when the rehab was complete. After all, he&#x2019;d designed it&#x2014;he, his two brothers, his mother. But the blueprints bore his name as architect, his primary function as a partner in Montgomery Family Contractors.</p><p>He crossed over, his tennis shoes nearly silent on the road in the breathless hush of three a.m. He walked under the scaffolding, along the side of the building, down St. Paul, pleased to see in the glow of the streetlight how well the stone and brick had cleaned up.</p><p>It looked old&#x2014;it <i>was</i> old, he thought, and that was part of its beauty and appeal. But now, for the first time in his memory, it looked tended.</p><p>He rounded the back, walked over the sunbaked dirt, through the construction rubble scattered over what would be a courtyard. Here the porches that spanned both the second and third stories ran straight and true. Custom-made pickets&#x2014;designed to replicate those from old photographs of the building, and the remnants found during excavation&#x2014;hung freshly primed and drying on a length of wire.</p><p>He knew his eldest brother, Ryder, in his role as head contractor, had the rails and pickets scheduled for install.</p><p>He knew because Owen, the middle of the three Montgomery brothers, plagued them all over schedules, calendars, projections, and ledgers&#x2014;and kept Beckett informed of every nail hammered.</p><p>Whether he wanted to be or not.</p><p>In this case, he supposed as he dug out his key, he wanted to be&#x2014;usually. The old hotel had become a family obsession.</p><p>It had him by the throat, he admitted as he opened the unfinished and temporary door to what would be The Lobby. And by the heart&#x2014;and hell, it had him by the balls. No other project they&#x2019;d ever worked on had ever gotten its hooks in him, in all of them, like this. He suspected none ever would again.</p><p>He hit the switch, and the work light dangling from the ceiling flashed on to illuminate bare concrete floors, roughed-in walls, tools, tarps, material.</p><p>It smelled of wood and concrete dust and, faintly, of the grilled onions someone must have ordered for lunch.</p><p>He&#x2019;d do a more thorough inspection of the first and second floors in the morning when he had better light. Stupid to have come over at this hour anyway, when he couldn&#x2019;t really see crap, and was dog tired. But he couldn&#x2019;t resist it.</p><p>By the balls, he thought again, passing under a wide archway, its edges of stone still rough and exposed. Then, flipping on his flashlight, he headed toward the front and the work steps that led up.</p><p>There was something about the place in the middle of the night, when the noise of nail guns, saws, radios, and voices ended, and the shadows took over. Something not altogether quiet, not altogether still. Something that brushed fingers over the back of his neck.</p><p>Something else he couldn&#x2019;t resist.</p><p>He swept his light around the second floor, noted the brown-bag backing on the walls. As always, Owen&#x2019;s report had been accurate. Ry and his crew had the insulation completed on this level.</p><p>Though he&#x2019;d intended to go straight up, he roamed here with a grin spreading over his sharply boned face, the pleasure of it lighting eyes the color of blue shadows.</p><p>&#x201c;Coming along,&#x201d; he said into the silence in a voice gravelly from lack of sleep.</p><p>He moved through the dark, following his beam of light, a tall man with narrow hips, the long Montgomery legs, and the waving mass of brown hair with hints of chestnut that came down from the Riley&#x2014;his maternal side.</p><p>He had to remind himself that if he kept poking around he&#x2019;d have to get up before he got to bed, so he climbed up to the third floor.</p><p>&#x201c;Now that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m talking about.&#x201d; Pure delight scattered thoughts of sleep as he traced a finger down the taped seam of freshly hung drywall.</p><p>He played his light over the holes cut out for electric, moved into what would be the innkeeper&#x2019;s apartment, and noted the same for plumbing in the kitchen and bath. He spent more time wandering through what would be their most elaborate suite, nodding approval at the floating wall dividing the generous space in the bath.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a frigging genius, Beck. Now, for God&#x2019;s sake, go home.&#x201d;</p><p>But giddy with fatigue and anticipation, he took one more good look before he made his way down the steps.</p><p>He heard it as he reached the second floor. A kind of humming&#x2014;and distinctly female. As the sound reached him, so did the scent. Honeysuckle, sweet and wild and ripe with summer.</p><p>His belly did a little dance, but he held the flashlight steady as he swept it down the hall into unfinished guest rooms. He shook his head as both sound and scent drifted away.</p><p>&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d; He spoke clearly, and his voice echoed back to him. &#x201c;And I guess you&#x2019;ve been here for a while. We&#x2019;re bringing her back, and then some. She deserves it. I hope to hell you like it when she&#x2019;s done because, well, that&#x2019;s the way it&#x2019;s going to be.&#x201d;</p><p>He waited a minute or two, fanciful enough&#x2014;or tired enough&#x2014;to imagine whoever, or whatever, inhabited the place settled on a wait-and-see mode.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re giving her the best we&#x2019;ve got, and we&#x2019;re pretty damn good.&#x201d;</p><p>He walked down, noted the work light no longer shone. Beckett turned it on again, switched it back off with another shrug. It wouldn&#x2019;t be the first time the current resident had messed with one of them.</p><p>&#x201c;Good night,&#x201d; he called out, then locked up.</p><p>This time he didn&#x2019;t wait for the light, but crossed diagonally. Vesta Pizzeria and Family Restaurant spread over another corner of The Square, with his apartment and office above. He walked down the sloping sidewalk to the back parking lot, grabbed his bag from the cab of his truck. Deciding he&#x2019;d murder anyone who called him before eight a.m., Beckett unlocked the stairwell, then climbed past the restaurant level to his door.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t bother with the light, but moved by memory and the backwash of streetlights through the apartment. He stripped by the bed, letting the clothes drop.</p><p>He flopped facedown on the mattress, and fell asleep thinking of honeysuckle.</p><p><b>THE CELL PHONE</b> he&#x2019;d left in his jeans pocket went off at six fifty-five.</p><p>&#x201c;Son of a bitch.&#x201d;</p>...</p><h2>The Forever Song (Blood of Eden)</h2><p>VENGEANCE WILL BE HERS<br><br>Allison Sekemoto once struggled with the question: human or monster?<br><br>With the death of her love, Zeke, she has her answer. <br><br>MONSTER<br><br>Allie will embrace her cold vampire side to hunt down and end Sarren, the psychopathic vampire who murdered Zeke.

Visit her at juliekagawa.com.<br><br>The outpost gate creaked in the wind, swinging back on its hinges. It knocked lightly against the wall, a rhythmic tapping sound that echoed in the looming silence. A cold breeze swirled through the gap, and the scent of blood lay on the air like a heavy blanket.<br><br>"He's been here," Kanin murmured at my side. The Master vampire was a dark statue against the falling snow, motionless and calm, but his eyes were grave. I regarded the fence impassively, the wind tugging at my coat and straight black hair.<br><br>"Is there any point in going in?"<br><br>"Sarren knows we're following him" was the low reply. "He meant for us to see this. He wants us to know that he knows. There will likely be something waiting for us when we step through the gate."<br><br>Footsteps crunched over the snow as Jackal stalked around us, black duster rippling behind him. His eyes glowed a vicious yellow as he peered up at the gate. "Well then," he said, the tips of his fangs showing through his grin, "if he went through all the trouble of setting this up, we shouldn't keep the psycho waiting, should we?"<br><br>He started forward, his step confident as he strode through the broken gate toward the tiny settlement beyond. After a moment's hesitation, Kanin and I followed.<br><br>The smell of blood grew stronger once we were past the wall, though nothing moved on the narrow path that snaked between houses. The flimsy wood and tin shanties were silent, dark, as we ventured deeper, passing snow-covered porches and empty chairs. Everything looked intact, undisturbed. There were no bodies. No corpses mutilated in their beds, no blood spattered over the walls of the few homes we ducked into. There weren't even any dead animals in the tiny trampled pasture past the main strip. Just snow and emptiness.<br><br>And yet, the smell of blood soaked this place, hanging thick in the air, making my stomach ache and the Hunger roar to life. I bit it down, gritting my teeth to keep from snarling in frustration. It had been too long. I needed food. The scent of blood was driving me crazy, and the fact that there were no humans here made me furious. Where were they? It wasn't possible that an entire outpost of mortals had up and disappeared without a trace.<br><br>And then, as we followed the path around the pasture and up to the huge barn at the top of the rise, we found the townspeople.<br><br>A massive barren tree stood beside the barn, twisted branches clawing at the sky. They swayed beneath the weight of dozens of bodies hanging upside down from ropes tied to the limbs. Men, women, even a few kids swinging in the breeze, dangling arms stiff and white. Their throats had been cut, and the base of the tree was stained black, the blood spilled and wasted in the snow. But the smell nearly knocked me over regardless, and I clenched my fists, the Hunger raking my insides with fiery talons.<br><br>"Well," Jackal muttered, crossing his arms and gazing at the tree, "isn't that festive?" His voice was tight as if he, too, was on the edge of losing it. "I'm guessing this is the reason we haven't found a single bloodbag from here all the way back to New Covington." He growled, shaking his head, lips curling back from his fangs. "This guy is really starting to piss me off."<br><br>I swallowed the Hunger, trying to focus through the gnawing ache. "Why, James, don't tell me you feel sorry for the walking meatsacks," I taunted, because sometimes, goading Jackal was the only thing that kept my mind off everything else. He rolled his eyes.<br><br>"No, sister, I'm annoyed because they don't have the decency to be alive so I can eat them," he returned with a flash of fangs and a rare show of temper. He glared at the bodies hungrily. "Fucking Sarren," he said. "If I didn't want the psychopath dead so badly, I would say the hell with it. If this keeps up, we're going to have to break off the trail to find a meatsack whose throat hasn't been slit, which is probably what the bastard wants." He sighed, giving me an exasperated look. "This would be so much easier if you hadn't killed the Jeep."<br><br>"For the last time," I growled at him, "I just pointed out the street that wasn't blocked off. I didn't leave those nails in the road for you to drive over."<br><br>"Allison."<br><br>Kanin's quiet voice broke through our argument, and we turned. Our sire stood at one corner of the barn, his face grim as he beckoned us forward. With a last glance at the tree and its grisly contents, I walked over to him, feeling the sharp stab of Hunger once more. The barn reeked of blood, even more than the branches of the tree. Probably because one whole wall of the building was streaked with it, dried and black, painted in vertical lines up and down the wood.<br><br>"Let's keep moving," Kanin said when Jackal and I joined him. His voice was calm, though I knew he was just as Hungry as the rest of us. Maybe more so, since he was still recovering from his near-death experience in New Covington. "There are no survivors here," Kanin went on, with a solemn look back at the tree, "and we are running out of time. Sarren is expecting us."<br><br>"How do you figure, old man?" Jackal asked, following me to the side of the barn. "Yeah, this is the psycho's handiwork, but he could've done this just for the jollies. You sure he knows we're coming?"<br><br>Kanin didn't answer, just gestured to the blood-streaked wall beside us. I looked over, as did Jackal, but couldn't see anything unusual. Beyond a wall completely covered in blood, anyway.<br><br>But Jackal gave a low, humorless chuckle. "Oh, you bastard." He smiled, shaking his head and staring up at the barn. "That's cute. Let's see if you're as funny when I'm beating you to death with your own arm."<br><br>"What?" I asked, obviously missing something. I stared at the barn again, wondering what the other vampires saw that I didn't. "What's so funny? I don't see anything."<br><br>Jackal sighed, stepped behind me, and hooked the back of my collar, pulling me away from the wall. "Hey!" I snarled, fighting him. "Let go! What the hell are you doing?"<br><br>He ignored me, continuing to walk backward, dragging me with him. We were about a dozen paces away from the wall before he stopped, and I yanked myself from his grip. "What is your problem?" I demanded, baring my fangs. Jackal silently pointed back to the barn.<br><br>I glanced at the wall again and stiffened. Now that I was farther away, I could see what Kanin and Jackal were talking about.<br><br><em>Sarren,</em> I thought, the cold, familiar hate spreading through my insides. <em>You sick bastard. This won't stop me, and it won't save you. When I find you, you'll regret ever hearing my name.</em><br><br>Painted across the side of the barn, written in bloody letters about ten feet tall, was a question. One that proved, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Sarren knew we were coming. And that we were probably walking right into a trap.<br><br>HUNGRY YET?<br><br>It had been two weeks since we'd left New Covington.<br><br>Two weeks travel, of walking down endless, snow-covered roads. Two weeks of cold and wilderness and dead, silent towns. Of empty houses wrapped in vines, deserted streets, ancient hulks of cars rusting in the gutters. No movement, except for the skitter of wildlife, both large and small, overtaking the streets humans had once ruled. The Jeep, as Jackal had so eloquently pointed out, was dead, leaving the three of us to wander the empty roads on foot, following a madman who knew we were coming. Who was always one step ahead of us.<br><br>Time was running out, Kanin had said. In a way, I supposed that was true. What Sarren had, what he carried, could spell the end for a lot of people. Maybe the whole world. Sarren possessed a mutated version of the Red Lung virus that had destroyed the world six decades ago, only this one came with a nasty little side effect: it killed vampires, too. The three of us-me, Jackal, and Kanin-had been exposed to Sarren's virus when we were in New Covington and had seen the true horror of the plague. Humans had turned into insane wretches who screamed and laughed and clawed at their faces until their skin was all but gone, and attacked anything they came across. For vampires, the effects were even more horrific; the virus ate their dead flesh, and they rotted away from the inside. In the final confrontation with Sarren, we'd learned that the insane vampire was using New Covington only as a test site, that his real intentions were far more sinister.<br><br>He planned to kill everything. All humans, and all vampires. Wipe the slate clean, he'd told me, and let the world finally heal itself. His virus, when he released it again, would be unstoppable.<br><br>There was just one small kink in his plans.<br><br>We had a cure. Or at least, we'd <em>had</em> one. It was in Eden now, that small bit of hope for the rest of the world. That was what Sarren wanted; the cure, either to destroy or to turn against us. He thought we were tracking him to Eden to stop him, to prevent him from destroying the cure or releasing his virus. He thought we were trying to save the world.<br><br>He didn't know. I didn't care about Eden. I didn't care about his virus, or the cure, or the rest of the world. It made no difference to me if the humans found a cure for Rabidism, or if they could stop Sarren's new plague. Humans meant nothing to me, not anymore. They were food, and I was a vampire. I was done pretending that I was anything less than a monster.<br><br>But I <em>would</em> kill Sarren.<br><br>He would die for what he'd done, what he'd destroyed. I would tear him apart, and I would make him suffer. There had been four of us that night in New Covington, when we had faced the mad vampire for the last time. When I had cut the arm from his body and he'd fled into the dark, only to return later for his most horrible deed yet. Four of us: me, Jackal, Kanin...and one other. But I couldn't think of him now. He was gone. And I was still a monster.<br><br>"Hey."<br><br>Abruptly, Jackal slowed and dropped back to where I trailed several paces behind Kanin's dark, steady figure, following the road that stretched on through the frozen plains. We'd left the outpost and its slaughtered residents a few miles back, and the scent of blood had finally faded into the wind. That didn't stop the Hunger, though; I could feel it even now, a constant throbbing ache, poised to flare into an inferno of raw, vicious need at the slightest provocation. It even raged at Jackal, annoyed that he wasn't human, that I couldn't spin around and sink my fangs into his throat. Jackal seemed happily oblivious.<br><br>I ignored him and kept my gaze straight ahead, not really in the mood for a fight or listening to his barbed, obnoxious comments. That, of course, never stopped my blood brother.<br><br>"So, sister," Jackal went on, "I've been wondering. When we finally do catch up to Sarren, how do you think we should kill the old bastard? I'm thinking maiming and torture for as long as we can stand it." He snapped his fingers. "Hey, maybe we can tie him half in and half out of the sun, that's always interesting. Did that to some undead bastard who pissed me off several years back. The light began at his feet and crawled up toward his face, and it took a very long time for him to finally kick it. By the end, he was screaming at me to cut off his head." He snickered. "I'd love to watch Sarren die like that. If that doesn't offend your delicate sensibilities, that is."<br><br>He smirked then, his gold eyes burning the side of my head. "Just wanted to give you a heads-up, little sister, in case you decide to go bleeding heart on me. Of course, if you have a suggestion for how we should do the old psycho in, I'd love to hear it."<br><br>"I don't care," I said flatly. "Do whatever you want. As long as I get to land the final blow, I couldn't care less."<br><br>Jackal huffed. "Well, that's not very fun."<br><br>I didn't answer, walking faster to get away from him, and he quickened his pace to keep up.<br><br>"Come on, sister, where's that obnoxious morality you kept throwing in my face every two seconds? You're making it very difficult to take any sort of pleasure in mocking it relentlessly."<br><br>"Why are you talking to me?" I asked, still not looking at him. Jackal let out an exasperated sigh.<br><br>"Because I'm <em>bored.</em> And the old man doesn't give me the time of day." He jerked his head at Kanin, still several yards ahead. I suspected Kanin could hear us, but he didn't turn around or give any indication that he was listening. And Jackal probably didn't care if he was. "And because I want to know your thoughts on our brilliantly disturbed serial killer." Jackal waved an impatient hand at the plains surrounding us. "It's still a long way to Eden, and I get the feeling we're not going to find any bloodbags-living ones anyway-from here to Meatsack Island. I don't particularly like the idea of facing the nut job with you and Kanin on the edge of losing it."<br><br>I flicked a glance at him and frowned. "What about you?"<br><br>"Oh, don't worry about me, sister." Jackal grinned. "I always come out on top, no matter what. I just want to point out that this annoying 'Scorched Earth' policy Sarren has picked up is going to make it very difficult for you. A couple more days of this, and the next human we see is going to be ripped to shreds-and you'll be the one doing it."<br><br>I shrugged. Jackal's revelation wasn't surprising, and I found that I really didn't care. Wherever Sarren went, whatever forgotten corner of the country he fled to, I wouldn't be far behind. No matter what he did, no matter how far or fast he ran, I would catch up to him, and then he would pay for what he had done. "So what?" I asked, returning my gaze to the road. "I'm a vampire. What does it matter?"<br><br>"Oh, please." I could hear the pity in his voice, and the disgust. "Enough with this 'I don't care anymore' shit. You know you're going to have to deal with it sometime."<br><br></p><h2>The Seven Standards of Ecological Breastfeeding: The Frequency Factor</h2><p>Mothers average 14 to 15 months without menstruation after childbirth when they breastfeed according to the Seven Standards of Ecological Breastfeeding.

Christmas in the city&#x2014;any city&#x2014;was the epitome of commercialism, and San Francisco was no exception. Here it was, barely December, and department-store windows had been filled with automated elves and tinsel-hung Christmas trees since before Thanksgiving!<br><br>Most annoying, in Greg's opinion, was the hustle and bustle of holiday shoppers, all of whom seemed to be unnaturally cheerful. That only made his own mood worse.<br><br>He wouldn't be in the city at all if he wasn't desperately in need of a bank loan. Without it, he'd be forced to lay off what remained of his crew by the end of the year. He'd have to close the winery's doors. His vines&#x2014;and literally decades of work&#x2014;had been wiped out by fan leaf disease, devastating the future of his vineyard and crippling him financially.<br><br>He'd spent the morning visiting one financial institution after another. Like a number of other growers, he'd applied at the small-town banks in the Napa Valley and been unsuccessful. His wasn't the only vineyard destroyed by the disease&#x2014;although, for reasons no one really understood, certain vineyards had been spared the blight. For a while there'd been talk of low-interest loans from the federal government, but they hadn't materialized. Apparently the ruin hadn't been thorough enough to warrant financial assistance. For Greg that news definitely fell into the category of cold comfort.<br><br>It left him in a dilemma. No loan&#x2014;no replanted vines. Without the vines there would be no grapes, without the grapes, no wine, and without the winery, no Gregory Bennett.<br><br>What he needed after a morning such as this, he decided, was a good stiff drink and the company of a charming female companion, someone who could help him forget his current troubles. He walked into the St. Francis, the elegant San Francisco hotel, and found himself facing a twenty-foot Christmas tree decorated with huge gold balls and plush red velvet bows. Disgusted, he looked away and hurried toward the bar.<br><br>The bartender seemed to sense his urgency. "What can I get you?" he asked promptly. He wore a name tag that identified him as Don.<br><br>Greg sat down on a stool. "Get me a martini," he said. If it hadn't been so early in the day, he would have asked for a double, but it was barely noon and he still had to drive home. He didn't feel any compelling reason to return. The house, along with everything else in his life, was empty. Oh, the furniture was all there&#x2014;Tess hadn't taken that&#x2014;but he was alone, more alone than he could ever remember being.<br><br>Tess, his third and greediest wife, had left him six months earlier. The attorneys were fighting out the details of their divorce, and at three hundred dollars an hour, neither lawyer had much incentive to rush into court.<br><br>Nevertheless, Tess was gone. He silently toasted eliminating her from his life and vowed not to make the mistake of marrying again. Three wives was surely sufficient evidence that he wasn't the stay-married kind.<br><br>Yet he missed Tess, he mused with some regret&#x2014;and surprise. Well, maybe not Tess exactly, but a warm body in his bed. By his side. Even at the time, he'd known it was foolish to marry her. He certainly <em>should</em> have known, after the messy end of his second marriage. His first had lasted ten years, and he'd split with Jacquie over... Hell if he could remember. Something stupid. It'd always been something stupid.<br><br>"You out shopping?" Don the bartender asked as he delivered a bowl of peanuts.<br><br>Greg snorted. "Not on your life."<br><br>The younger man smiled knowingly. "Ah, you're one of those."<br><br>"You mean someone who's got common sense. What is it with people and Christmas? Normal, sane human beings become sentimental idiots." A year ago, when he and Tess had been married less than eighteen months, she'd made it clear she expected diamonds for Christmas. Lots of them. She'd wanted him to make her the envy of her friends. That was what he got for marrying a woman nineteen years his junior. A pretty blonde with a figure that could stop traffic. Next time around he'd simply move the woman into his house and send her packing when he grew bored with her. No more marriages&#x2014;not for him. He didn't need any more legal entanglements.<br><br>Just then a blond beauty entered the bar, and Greg did a double take. For half a heartbeat, he thought it was Tess. Thankfully he was wrong. Blond, beautiful and probably a bitch. The last part didn't bother him, though&#x2014;especially now, when he could use a little distraction. He'd be sixty-one his next birthday, but he was trim and fit, and still had all his hair&#x2014;gone mostly gray, what people called "distinguished." In fact, he could easily pass for ten years younger. His good looks had taken him a long way in this world, and he'd worked hard to maintain a youthful appearance.<br><br>"Welcome," he greeted her, swerving around on his stool to give her his full attention.<br><br>"Hello."<br><br>Her answering smile told him she wasn't averse to his company. Yes, she might well provide a distraction. If everything worked out, he might stay in town overnight. Considering the morning he'd had, he deserved a little comfort. He wasn't interested in anything serious&#x2014;just a light flirtation to take his mind off his troubles, a dalliance to momentarily distract him.<br><br>"Are you meeting someone?" Greg asked.<br><br>"Not really," she said, her voice sultry and deep.<br><br>Greg noted the packages. "Been shopping, I see."<br><br>She nodded, and when the bartender walked over to her table, Greg said, "Put it on my tab."<br><br>"Thanks," she said in that same sultry voice. He was even more impressed when she asked for a glass of Bennett Wine. A pinot noir.<br><br>He slipped off the stool and approached her table. "I'm Greg."<br><br>"Cherry Adams."<br><br>He liked her name; it suited her. "Do you mind if I join you?"<br><br>"Go ahead. Why not?"<br><br>The day was already looking brighter. He pulled out a chair and sat down. They made small talk for a few minutes, exchanged pleasantries. He didn't mention his last name because he didn't want her to make the connection and have their conversation weighed down by the problems at Bennett Wines. However, it soon became clear that she was knowledgeable about wine&#x2014;and very flattering about his 1996 pinot noir. Tess had been an idiot on the subject, despite being married to the owner of a winery. She didn't know the difference between chablis and chardonnay. And she never did understand why he couldn't call his own sparkling wine champagne, no matter how many times he told her the name could only be used for sparkling wines from the Champagne region of France.<br><br>After another glass of wine for her and a second martini for him, Greg suggested lunch. Cherry hesitated and gazed down at her hands. "Sorry, but I've got a nail appointment."<br><br>"You could cancel it," Greg suggested, trying to hint that they could find more entertaining ways to occupy themselves. He didn't want her to think he was being pushy. Later, after lunch, he'd surprise her and announce who he really was. He was pleased&#x2014;no, delighted&#x2014;by her interest in him, particularly because she didn't know he was the man responsible for the wine she'd described as "exquisite." He grinned; wait till he told her. Cherry's interest proved what he'd been telling himself ever since Tess had walked out on him. He was still young, still vital, still sexy.<br><br>That was when it happened.<br><br>The look that crossed Cherry's face conveyed her thoughts as clearly as if she'd said them aloud. She wasn't interested. Oh, sure, he was good for a few drinks, especially since he was buying. Good for an hour of conversation. But that was all.<br><br>"I really do have to go," Cherry said as she reached for her shopping bags. "My nails are a mess. Thanks for the, uh, company and the wine, though."<br><br>"Don't mention it," Greg muttered, watching her leave. He was still reeling from the blow to his pride.<br><br>Soon afterward, he left, too. He'd never been one to take rejection well, mainly because he'd had so little experience of it.<br><br>After two martinis he knew he wasn't in any condition to drive. So he left his car in the lot and started to walk. With no destination in mind, he wandered down the crowded street, trying to keep his distance from all those happy little shoppers. His stomach growled and his head hurt, but not nearly as much as his ego. Every time he thought about the look on Cherry's face, he cringed. Okay, okay, she'd been too young. At a guess he'd say she was no more than thirty.<br><br>However, Greg knew a dozen women her age who would leap at the opportunity to spend a day and a night with him. He was suave, sophisticated and rich. Not as rich as he'd once been&#x2014;would be again, as soon as he got this latest mess straightened out. <em>If</em> he got it straightened out. The truth was, he stood on the brink of losing everything.<br><br>Desperate to escape his dark thoughts, he began to walk at a brisker pace. He made an effort not to think, not to acknowledge his fears and worries, concentrating, instead, on the movement of his feet, the rhythm of his breath. He turned corner after corner and eventually found himself on a side street dominated by an imposing brick church.<br><br>He paused in front of it. A church. Now that was a laugh. He remembered how his mother had dragged him and his brother, Phil, to service every Sunday. He'd even attended services while he was in college. But he hadn't darkened the door of a church since...Catherine.<br><br>She'd been his sweetheart, his <em>lover,</em> during college&#x2014;until he'd broken it off. No, abandoned her. That was a more honest description of what he'd done. The years had numbed his guilt, and he rarely thought of her anymore. Funny how a relationship that had ended more than thirty-five years ago could suddenly rise up to haunt him. He'd been a senior the last time he'd seen Catherine. They'd been madly in love. Then she'd told him she was pregnant and Greg had panicked. About to graduate, about to start his life, he'd done what had seemed sensible at the time; he'd fled.<br><br>Unable to face her, he'd written Catherine a letter and told her he was leaving. She should do whatever she wanted about the baby. It'd been cowardly of him, but he was just a kid back then; he'd long since stopped berating himself over it. He'd never heard from her again. He didn't know what she'd done about the baby. Didn't want to know. Abortions hadn't been legal at the time, but there were ways of getting rid of an unwanted pregnancy even then. His mother hadn't ever learned why his relationship with Catherine had ended, but Phil knew. That was the beginning of the estrangement between Greg and his brother.<br><br>Almost without realizing it, Greg began to move up the church steps. He blamed it on the throng of shoppers crowding in around him. All he wanted was a few moments of peace and quiet. A chance to think.<br><br>He hesitated on the top step. He didn't belong in a church, not the way he'd lived. And yet...<br><br>His life was empty and he was old enough to recognize that. But at sixty, it was a bit late. For most of his adult life, he'd followed the path of least resistance, put his own interests above those of other people. He'd believed that was the basis of prosperity, of success. Deserting Catherine was where it had started.<br><br>She'd been the first of his regrets. Matthias was the second. And then his mother.<br><br>Matthias Jamison was his father's cousin and an employee at the winery. Greg's parents had divorced when he was in high school, and he and Phil had spent summers with their father at the vineyard. Although the younger of the two, Greg was the one who'd been drawn to the family business. He'd spent hour after hour there, learning everything he could about wine and wine making.<br><br>Ten years his senior, Matthias had taken Greg under his wing. What John Bennett didn't teach Greg about wine making, Matthias did. His father had also insisted Greg get a business degree, and he'd been right. Several years later, when he died, Greg bought out Phil's half to become sole owner and worked with Matthias operating the winery.<br><br>The wine had always been good. What the business needed was an aggressive advertising campaign. People couldn't order the Bennett label if they'd never heard of it. The difficulty with Greg's ideas was the huge financial investment they demanded. Commissioning sophisticated full-page ads and placing them in upscale food magazines, attending wine expositions throughout the world&#x2014;it had all cost money. He'd taken a gamble, which was just starting to pay off when Matthias came to him, needing a loan.<br><br>Mary, Matthias's wife of many years, had developed a rare form of blood cancer. The experimental drug that might save her life wasn't covered by their health insurance. The cost of the medication was threatening to bankrupt Matthias; his savings were gone and no bank would lend him money. He'd asked Greg for help. After everything the older man had done for him and for his family, Greg knew he owed Matthias that and more.<br><br>The decision had been agonizing. Bennett Wines was just beginning to gain recognition; sales had doubled and tripled.<br><br>But Greg's plans were bigger than that. He'd wanted to help Matthias, but there was no guarantee the treatment would be effective. So he'd turned Matthias down. Mary had died a few months later, when conventional treatments failed, and a bitter Matthias had left Bennett Wines and moved to Washington state.<br><br>Generally Greg didn't encourage friendships. He tended to believe that friends took advantage of you, that they resented your success. It was every man for himself, in Greg's view. Still, Matthias had been the best friend he'd ever had. Because of what happened, the two men hadn't spoken in fifteen years.<br><br>Greg could have used Matthias's expertise in dealing with the blight that had struck his vines, but he was too proud to give him the opportunity to slam the door in his face. To refuse him the way he'd refused Matthias all those years ago.<br><br>No, Greg definitely wasn't church material. Whatever had possessed him to think he should go into this place, seek solace here, he couldn't fathom.<br><br>He was about to turn away when he noticed that the church doors were wide open. Had they been open all this time? He supposed they must have been. It was almost as if he was being invited inside.... He shook his head, wondering where <em>that</em> ridiculous thought had come from. Nevertheless, he slowly walked in.<br><br>The interior was dim and his eyes took a moment to adjust. He saw that the sanctuary was huge, with two rows of pews facing a wide altar. Even the church was decorated for the holidays. Pots of red and white poinsettias were arranged on the altar, and a row of gaily decorated Christmas trees stood behind it. A large cross hung suspended from the ceiling.<br><br>An organ sat off to one side, along with a sectioned space for the choir. Greg hadn't stopped to notice which denomination this church was. Nor did he care.<br><br>Although his mother had been an ardent churchgoer, Greg had hated it, found it meaningless. But Phil seemed to eat this reli...</p><h2>The Meaning and End of Religion</h2><p>The Meaning and End of Religion [Paperback] [Jan 05, 1991] Cantwell Smith, Wi...</p><p></p><h2>The Sacred Power: A Seeker&#39;s Guide to Kundalini</h2><p>Based on scriptural and authoritative works from the East and West, this volume includes the author's own experiences with <i>kundalini</i> (the creative power of the universe) as well as those of other contemporary seekers.<br></p><p><b>Swami Kripananda, </b>a former professor of Spanish literature and language, teaches Siddha Yoga courses under the guidance of her spiritual master, Gurumayi Chidvilasananda.<br>Kundalini is the primal power of the universe.

His sketches, which explain this colonial architecture, delight as much as they inform. The book also serves as a gentle reminder to Yankees that Florida was civilized before the Puritans settled New England."--F. Blair Reeves, chairman, Historic Resource Committee, Florida Association/American Institute of Architects As architecture documents history, The Houses of St. Augustine records architecture, preserving and interpreting the history of housing in the oldest city in the continental United States.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The charming two-story house so distinctive to St. Augustine offers tangible evidence of Spanish settlement in the New World. Long before Pedro Menendez de Aviles founded St. Augustine, houses similar to the loggia-and-balcony houses of St. Augustine existed in his home province of Oviedo and in nearby Santander. The special feature of the casa Santanderina design, which Manucy calls the "St. Augustine Plan," is a roofed balcony over the street or the yard that anticipates the "Florida room" of this century. On both the north coast of Spain and the northeast coast of Florida, the porch excludes the cold wind and admits the sun in winter; it lets in the breeze and tempers the hot sun in summer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon its first publication thirty years ago, this classic volume contributed to an awakening of interest in St. Augustine architecture; it continues to be the basic reference tool for colonial period restoration and for the ongoing archaeological and anthropological research in the city. In detailed drawings and nontechnical language, the book identifies basic house types and records their dimensions, construction techniques, materials, and design details from foundations to roofs. It has been the cornerstone that enabled the St. Augustine government to frame architecture guidelines for preservation and restoration of existing historic buildings, reconstruction of lost structures, and construction of contemporary homes in designs that are compatible with the historic architecture.<br>Albert Manucy worked for thirty-three years for the National Park Service as a historian, restorationist, and museum planner. He has written many books on architecture and history, including Seeing St. Augustine, a publication of the Federal Writers Project American Guide Series, and The Building of Castillo de San Marcos. He has received the Amigos de los Castillos silver medal from the government of Spain and awards from the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation and the Eastern National Park and Monument Association, and he was granted the Order of La Florida by the city of St. Augustine. Manucy was born in St. Augustine and has witnessed the loss of many historic houses. His incentive to write this volume came from the realization that St. Augustine architecture is unique and needed analysis in order to ensure accurate preservation and interpretation.<br>Published in cooperation with the St. Augustine Historical Society</p><p></p><h2>The Essential Ellen Willis</h2><p><p><i>Out of the Vinyl Deeps</i>, published in 2011, introduced a new generation to the incisive, witty, and merciless voice of Ellen Willis through her pioneering rock music criticism. In the years that followed, Willis&#x2019;s daring insights went beyond popular music, taking on such issues as pornography, religion, feminism, war, and drugs. </p><p><i>The Essential Ellen Willis</i> gathers writings that span forty years and are both deeply engaged with the times in which they were first published and yet remain fresh and relevant amid today&#x2019;s seemingly intractable political and cultural battles.

This anthology is espresso for the feminist soul." &#x2014;Barbara Ehrenreich</p><br><br>"Ellen Willis was one of the few great critics of her generation.

From abortion and parenting to music and politics, Willis&#x2019;s cultural critiques stand the test of time and fascinate over and again. <i>The Essential Ellen Willis</i> reinvigorated me and reminded me why I do the work that I do. It should be required reading for anyone interested in feminism, politics, and everything in between!"&nbsp;&#x2014;Jessica Valenti<br><br><br>"Gathering 53 career-spanning pieces, this is an act of reclamation, a reminder of what a piercing and brilliant writer Willis was."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times<br><br></i>"Willis often finds her stride in complexity, and here she intricately examines and interrogates the notions of freedom she holds dear. It&#x2019;s a moving example of a wonderful mind at work." &#x2014;<i>Bookforum</i><br><br><i>"The Essential Ellen Willis </i>is watching the journalist and critic figure out how feminism translates into daily life, both for herself and for other women. Willis is intellectually rigorous and deeply idealistic, but also very fun&#x2013;and her combination of curiosity, wit, skepticism, and enthusiasm grounds her work firmly in the real world." &#x2014;<i>New York Magazine</i>'s The Cut<br><br>"Achieving the kind of lucidity that never flees complexity was always her goal. Spotting the antipodes hidden in seeming allegiances&#x2014;and vice-versa&#x2014;was one of her specialties. Re-encountering insights and stray observations of Willis&#x2019;s that had stayed messily filed in my brain for 30 years or more was an ongoing pleasure." &#x2014;<i>The American Prospect</i><br><br>"Reading Ellen Willis&#x2019; criticism has always been simultaneously invigorating and depressing for me&#x2014;invigorating as a reminder that feminist thought can be radical and liberating and nuanced, but depressing when viewed against a 21st-century feminist landscape that too often prizes self-purification and bad-faith consensus over critical thinking and powerful ideas, which have come to seem like two more nice things we can&#x2019;t have anymore." &#x2014;<i>Flavorwire</i><br><br>"Part of what makes Willis perennially compelling is that she was a utopian thinker, the rigorous rather than the hippie dippy kind now beloved of 1960s detractors.

Gillian Ormsby is a New York corporate executive returns to her California home to take care of her mother Dorothy, who appears to be physically healthy but who won't do anything but sleep. Gillian's sister, Allison, the preferred child who stayed close to home, is being less than helpful. When Gillian arrives after crossing the country, she finds her mother's once beautiful garden as wilted as its caretaker. She is aided in her efforts by her mother's dapper friend, Enzio, who brings killer pastries when he visits, and her mother's neighbor Adam, who owns a dog and a garden store and happens to be handsome. The narrative hits some true notes: Dorothy's passive depression will strike those caring for elderly parents as familiar. Off-notes include Allison, who needs more characterization, and Gillian's generic corporate career. The tale is uneven, but Snelling can certainly charm. (Apr.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

A journalist for national and specialist publications, and the Internet, he was the science fiction and fantasy book reviewer for London listings magazine <em>Time Out</em> for six years, and subsequently reviewed popular science titles for the magazine. He received the <em>Le'Fantastique Lifetime Achievement Award for Contributions to Literature </em>in<em> </em>April 2007. Find out more about the orcs at www.theorcsarecoming.com.Starred Review. This shelf-bending omnibus comprises the first U.S. release of Nicholls's Orcs trilogy (Bodyguard of Lightning, Legion of Thunder and Warriors of the Tempest), originally published in the U.K. in 1999 and 2000. When a warband of orcs run afoul of their tyrannical mistress on a mission to retrieve an invaluable artifact, they set in motion a series of cataclysmic events that could free their race from long-standing persecution or obliterate them from the realm forever. Pursued by an irate sorceress, ruthless bounty hunters and two vengeance-obsessed armies, Captain Stryke and his misfit band of mercenary orcs embark on a desperate quest to find a set of ancient "instrumentalities" that could save them and their magic-filled world from destruction at the hands of human interlopers. With grand scale world building, labyrinthine plotlines, extensive backstory and pedal-to-the-metal action, Nicholls captures adventure fantasy at its very best. This edition-which also includes a short story entitled "The Taking" (a prequel to the three novels), and an in-depth author interview-will be a cult classic with quest fantasy fans on both sides of the Pond. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 2688, interstellar transports <i>Seeker</i> and <i>Bremerhaven</i> left a theocratic Orwellian Earth to found a dictator-free society, Margolia&#x2014;and vanished. Nine thousand years later, with a flawed humanity spread over 100-odd worlds, Margolia and its ships have become Atlantis-type myths, but after a cup from <i>Seeker</i> falls into the hands of antiquarian Alex Benedict, the hero of McDevitt's <i>Polaris</i> (2004), Alex determines to win everlasting fame and vaster fortune by finding them. Female pilot Chase Kolpath, this book's narrator, gutsily tracks the ancient <i>Seeker</i> on a breathless trek across star systems and through an intriguing mystery plot, a bevy of fully realized characters, ingenious AI ships and avatars of long-departed personalities who offer advice and entertainment. The scientific interpolations are as convincing as the far-future planetscapes and human and alien societies, bolstering an irresistible tractor beam of heavy-duty action.

Educated by Jesuits, he was an excellent pupil but one quickly enraged by dogma. An early rift with his father--who wished him to study law--led to his choice of letters as a career. Insinuating himself into court circles, he became notorious for lampoons on leading notables and was twice imprisoned in the Bastille. By his mid-thirties his literary activities precipitated a four-year exile in England where he won the praise of Swift and Pope for his political tracts. His publication, three years later in France, of Lettres philosophiques sur les Anglais (1733)--an attack on French Church and State--forced him to flee again. For twenty years Voltaire lived chiefly away from Paris. In this, his most prolific period, he wrote such satirical tales as &#34;Zadig&#34; (1747) and &#34;Candide&#34; (1759). His old age at Ferney, outside Geneva, was made bright by his adopted daughter, &#34;Belle et Bonne,&#34; and marked by his intercessions in behalf of victims of political injustice. Sharp-witted and lean in his white wig, impatient with all appropriate rituals, he died in Paris in 1778--the foremost French author of his day.</p><h2>Grace in Galatia: A Commentary on Paul&#39;s Letter to the Galatians</h2><p><i>Grace in Galatia</i> is an innovative socio-rhetorical study of Paul's most polemical letter. Ben Witherington breaks new ground by analyzing the whole of Galatians as a deliberative discourse meant to forestall the Galatians from submitting to circumcision and the Jewish law.<br><br>The commentary features the latest discussion of major problems in Pauline studies, including Paul's view of the law and the relationship between the historical data in Galatians and in Acts. Yet the narrative character of Witherington's work allows it to remain exceedingly accessible.<br><br>The volume also includes sections following the major divisions of the commentary that point to the relevance of the text for believers today, making <i>Grace in Galatia</i> of special value to pastors and general readers as well as students and scholars.</p><p>Ben Witherington III is Amos Professor of New Testament for Doctoral Studies at Asbury Theological Seminary, Wilmore, Kentucky, and is on the doctoral faculty at St. Andrews University, Scotland.<b><i>Interpretation</i></b><br>"Witherington is to be commended for taking stock of recent scholarship on Galatians and distilling it into a commentary that is accessible to students, teachers, or pastors. . . . Outstanding guide through Paul's letter."<br><br><b><i>Review &amp; Expositor</i></b><br>"As one might expect, [Witherington's] commentary on Galatians is superb and it will certainly take its place alongside the works by Richard Longenecker and Hans Getz. . . . The commentary itself is a model of scholarly analysis and brings to the reader the insights of contemporary sociological studies to assist in the interpretation of the text. . . .

Whether a character is seeking the solace of a poem or avoiding the emotional weight of a song, each one learns in some way the power that words and art have over (and even beyond) life. This power sometimes feels familiar to us, such as when a character in &#x201c;The Cold Flame&#x201d; returns as a ghost to make sure his poems get published, and sometimes takes a more uncanny turn, more magic and danger than your everyday reverence for a novel or a painting. But in every case, this supernatural treatment of the arts gives the stories a strangely pre-modern tone, a mode of writing that became increasingly unpopular in literature in the post-war days Aiken wrote in.

The magical and the everyday collide in these short, evocative tales, which, in marvelously efficient, elegant prose, find unsettling strangeness lurking just around the corner from normal (the ghost of a puppy is trapped in an abandoned storage box, fairy queen squat in overgrown forests). A slim, seriously moving collection.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015; Joel Cunningham, B&amp;N SF&amp;F<br><br>&#x201c;A welcome anthology of fantasy stories by a 20th-century master. The author of the beloved classic gothic for children <em>The Wolves of Willoughby Chase,</em> Aiken (1924-2004) also wrote hundreds of works of popular fiction that spanned the genres, from fantasy to horror to historical fiction, including several Jane Austen sequels. Naturally the tone of her books and short stories varies with their content, but its main notes include sophisticated, spritely satire and the darker moods of literary fairy tales. Fans of Wolves will recognize the honorable orphans and cruel guardians who populate these tales. Typically the wicked meet with fitting fates and the innocent triumph, though for Aiken, a good death counts as a happy ending. She plays with the contrast between the eldritch and modern culture and technology: ghosts and dead kings out of legend who contact the living by telephone, a doctor who writes prescriptions for fairies, a fairy princess who&#x2019;s fond of Westerns. Her metaphors and similes surprise and delight: &#x201c;the August night was as gentle and full as a bucket of new milk&#x201d;; &#x201c;He was tall and pale, with a bony righteous face and eyes like faded olives&#x201d;; across a field, &#x201c;lambs [followed] their mothers like iron filings drawn to a magnet in regular converging lines.&#x201d; Sprightly but brooding, with well-defined plots, twists, and punch lines, these stories deserve a place on the shelf with the fantasies of Saki (H.H. Munro), Sylvia Townsend Warner, and Susanna Clarke.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015; <em>Kirkus Reviews</em> (starred review)<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s so much to love about this slender collection...

Whether a character is seeking the solace of a poem or avoiding the emotional weight of a song, each one learns in some way the power that words and art have over (and even beyond) life. This power sometimes feels familiar to us, such as when a character in The Cold Flame&#x201d; returns as a ghost to make sure his poems get published, and sometimes takes a more uncanny turn, more magic and danger than your everyday reverence for a novel or a painting. But in every case, this supernatural treatment of the arts gives the stories a strangely pre-modern tone, a mode of writing that became increasingly unpopular in literature in the post-war days Aiken wrote in.
